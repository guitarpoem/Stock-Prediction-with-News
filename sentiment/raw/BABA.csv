2014-06-26,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of alibaba. Let me start by breaking down each tweet.

First, the target stock is alibaba, which has the ticker symbol BA. The user provided five tweets about alibaba's IPO attempt and other related mentions. I'll go through each one step by step.

1. The first tweet says, ""alibaba revealed today in an updated sec filing that its us ipo ... URL"". This seems like a news update regarding their IPO. When companies announce an IPO or major milestones, they often provide details to investors. This positive news could boost the stock price because it's expected to go public.

2. The second tweet is similar: ""alibaba to ipo on the nyse with ticker $ baba URL it tech"". Again, mentioning listing on NYSE and its ticker symbol suggests more information is being revealed about their IPO efforts. Positive announcements typically lead to positive sentiment in stocks.

3. The third tweet is a bit different: ""$ baba"" followed by ""AT_USER alibaba to list on nyse URL $ baba"". This seems like an attempt to clarify or confirm the listing, possibly as a joke or to ensure they're correctly listed. Sometimes, companies use this kind of language to avoid misunderstandings.

4. The fourth tweet is ""rt AT_USER breaking : alibaba to list on the new york stock exchange under the ticker $ baba ."". This sounds like a breaking news announcement, confirming their IPO listing in another major exchange (New York Stock Exchange). Confirmations can be reassuring for investors, especially if they're checking multiple exchanges.

5. The fifth tweet says, ""ну а что ? нормальный тиккер “ AT_USER alibaba to ipo on the nyse with ticker $ baba URL by AT_USER"". It seems like a random question or lack of clarity. Sometimes people use humor or confusion in their tweets, which can lead to uncertainty among investors.

Now, compiling these thoughts: The first tweet is positive because they're revealing more about their IPO. The second is similar. The third might be a bit confusing but not necessarily negative. The fourth confirms listing on another exchange, which is positive. However, the fifth seems like it's making no sense to me.

Considering all this, while some tweets are clear and positive, one is a bit unclear or humorous, which could have mixed results. But overall, most of them indicate that alibaba is aiming for an IPO. The lack of clarity in the fifth tweet might cause some uncertainty, but not enough to make it negative. So I think the sentiment is leaning towards [Positive]."
2014-06-27,Positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of BABA. Let me start by breaking down what each tweet is saying.

First tweet: ""rt AT_USER ipo will be august 8th ... rt AT_USER ' ba ba ' is mandarin for ' 88 . ' luckynumber 8 $ baba $ yhoo."" This seems to be promoting the IPO event and mentioning something about Chinese stocks. It's looking positive because it's talking about an upcoming event, which could drive stock prices up.

Second tweet: ""rt AT_USER chinese internet giant alibaba will list on nyse with the ticker symbol $ baba . URL."" This directly mentions BABA as a NYSE listed company. Positive because listing on the NYSE is a significant event for investors looking to buy their stock, so it should boost the price.

Third tweet: Same as the second one, ""rt AT_USER Chinese internet giant alibaba will list on nyse with the ticker symbol $ baba . URL."" So another positive note confirming BABA's listing. It reinforces investor confidence that it might go public soon.

Fourth tweet: Another duplicate of the third, so nothing new here.

Fifth tweet: ""rt AT_USER chinese internet giant alibaba to list on nyse under symbol $ baba ; could be largest ever u . s . listing . URL."" Similar to the others, promoting BABA's listing and speculating about it being a major achievement. Positive because listing increases investor interest.

Sixth tweet: ""my big 2014 market prediction for those that understand ... if $ baba price is traded up on ipo and $ fb goes down , we will see a big correction."" This is a prediction. It's talking about stock price movements, specifically mentioning an IPO (which was actually a typo in the first tweet) and another stock ($fb). The user is predicting a possible correction because of conflicting trends. This can lead to uncertainty, which might cause market reactions—so it's not purely positive or negative but mixed.

Putting it all together: Most tweets are positive about BABA's listing, especially the five that mention listing on NYSE and its potential impact. But the sixth tweet adds some context with a prediction that could affect investor sentiment positively in the short term but might lead to uncertainty overall. However, since many tweets are optimistic about the future of BABA, the positive sentiment is dominant. The negative and neutral interpretations might be limited because while there's a warning, it's not strong enough to outweigh the positive ones.

So, I think the overall sentiment should be Positive."

2014-06-30,Positive,"Alright, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price. Let's start by looking at each tweet individually.

The first tweet mentions that $baba will be the first trillion dollar company and will rocket past a valuation target, with a suggested trading range of $50 to $70. It seems like the author is predicting a significant increase in the stock price. That sounds positive because if someone predicts a rise, it's likely to influence investor expectations positively.

The second tweet states that at nyse, ""Al parecer dicen que el momento lo tiene la nyse."" So they're saying something about $baba and its performance. The quote uses ""dicen que"" which means ""as they say,"" suggesting their opinion is being expressed. But it's not directly predicting a price movement; it's just mentioning the company. This makes me think that this tweet might not have a strong enough influence on investor sentiment to be classified as positive or negative. It could maybe indicate mixed opinions, but without concrete information about the stock price range, it's hard to tell.

Combining both tweets, the first one is more direct and predicts a rise in price, which has a strong positive impact. The second tweet, while making a comment, doesn't provide enough context or evidence of how that affects the stock. So overall, the positive tweet seems to have a stronger influence on the stock's sentiment.

I should consider that the first tweet is more impactful because it's providing a specific outlook with a range, which investors might use as a reference point. The second tweet is less precise but still could contribute by suggesting some perspective on the company, possibly influencing expectations without a clear move in price direction.

So, weighing both tweets, I lean towards a positive overall sentiment for the stock."

2014-07-03,Negative,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to determine if the given tweet is positive, neutral, or negative for affecting the stock price of a company. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. The tweet mentions ""alphabeta's ipo isn't about alibaba at all."" It seems like it's talking about an IPO (Initial Public Offering) event. In Chinese financial terms, an IPO is when a company goes public for raising capital. So I think the target stock here would be AlphaBeta Inc., which makes sense because the mention of ""alphabeta"" often refers to their products or companies.

Next, I need to break down each tweet into its factors. The given tweet doesn't have any other tweets mentioned in this example, so maybe it's just a single tweet that's considered.

Now, assessing the sentiment. The tweet says, ""alpha beta's ipo isn't about alibaba at all. it's about paving the way for other chinese companies."" It seems like the author is critical of AlphaBeta focusing on their own (alphabeta) products and suggesting that they should focus more on other Chinese companies instead. This implies that the tweet is expressing concern or disapproval towards AlphaBeta's current strategy, which might affect investor sentiment.

Considering the context, if investors are concerned about a company's strategy, especially regarding its own product portfolio versus others in the same sector, it could lead to negative sentiment because they might think the company is overfocusing on their own products and could hurt competition or customer satisfaction. Also, focusing on other companies could indicate a competitive advantage.

So putting this together: The tweet is critical of AlphaBeta's strategy, expressing disapproval or concern about their current approach. This would likely lead to negative sentiment in their stock because the company might be seen as underperforming due to its focus on others rather than itself."

2014-07-11,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of BABA. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First tweet: ""$ baba ipo looking like mid-august - wsj $ yhoo URL"". Hmm, that seems a bit confusing with all those dollar signs and links. Maybe it's some kind of announcement or typo. I'm not sure what the tweet is saying about BABA. It could be an event they're planning but not sure if it's positive or negative for their stock.

Second tweet: ""Baba ipo looking good, we need more investors to join"". This looks like a statement from the management team. They’re promising that they’ll launch the company soon and are seeking more investors' support. I think this is positive because they're showing potential growth and expansion plans. It might boost stock price.

Third tweet: ""Baba ipo looking great, we need more investors to join"". Similar to the second one, just rephrased a bit but still showing promise of expansion and getting more investors on board. So again, this is positive for BABA's performance.

Putting it all together, the first tweet might be about an IPO or something unrelated, so not sure about its impact yet. The next two tweets are from management, promising growth and getting more investor support, which suggests strong sentiment towards their future prospects. Therefore, overall I think the stock is expected to be positive."

2014-07-13,Missing,File not found
2014-07-14,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, I have four tweets and I need to determine their impact on a stock's future price. The options are Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

First, looking at the target stock: alibaba.com. I remember that Alibaba is known for its e-commerce platform and has been involved in some big tech companies like Facebook and Twitter. So, they're probably in a growth phase, which might mean higher stock prices could be expected as the company expands.

Now, let's go through each tweet one by one.

The first tweet says ""alibaba adjusts valuation , tightens partnership control URL $ baba."" Okay, so Alibaba is adjusting their valuation, which is a common action they might take when they see growth. They're also tightening partnership control, which could affect their products or partnerships. Since they're expanding and the stock is for them, this seems positive because it's showing confidence in future performance.

The second tweet is ""alibaba adjusts valuation , tightens partnership control URL $ baba."" That looks like a repeat of the first tweet. Again, adjusting valuations is good for investors, especially if there are changes that make them more attractive to buy. So this adds another positive point.

Third tweet: ""Alibaba Adjusts Valuation, Ties Up with BABA. The stock's moving up higher."" It says they're adjusting valuations and tying their product together with BABA. Tying products together can boost company performance as well. This is clearly a strong statement about the stock moving up, which would be positive.

Fourth tweet: ""Alibaba Adjusts Valuation , Ties Up with BABA. The stock's moving up higher."" Same as the third one; another quote from Alibaba adjusting valuations and tying products together. Again, this reinforces that the stock is moving up.

Putting it all together, each of these tweets seems to be reinforcing the idea that alibaba.com is increasing its valuation and is connecting their product with BABA. These actions are positive for investors because they show confidence in the company's future growth potential. The repeated statements about tightening partnership control or adjusting valuations are signals that investors think there's a lot more to come, which would likely push the stock up.

So, considering all these factors—expansion, product ties-up, and positive valuation adjustments—the overall sentiment seems positive. Investors are seeing strong signs that the stock is undervalued and could rise in price."
2014-07-15,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of BABA. First, I need to understand each tweet and identify if they mention the stock symbol or anything related to it.

Looking at the first tweet: It says ""mt AT_USER $ yhoo up ah on news of keeping add'l 68m s / s of $ baba + AT_USER only having half the lowered net cash to blow ."" Hmm, I see ""BH"" in some part of the sentence. But BABA isn't mentioned here. So maybe this tweet is just some extra info or an unrelated message.

Next, the second tweet mentions an Alibaba IPO and says it's still looking like the first week of August. It specifically mentions $ baba but doesn't mention BABA directly. I'm not sure how significant this is for BABA stock since it's related to another company, Alibaba, which might be a different sector.

The third tweet talks about AT_USER effects change after the $ baba IPO and management's plan regarding cash pile. Again, ""BH"" isn't present, but again, no mention of BABA. This could indicate some ongoing discussion or analysis about other companies that might have an impact on BABA's stock, but not directly.

The fourth tweet states that YHOO is still facing a big challenge in mobile URL and $ baba. Again, I see ""BH"" here, which isn't related to BABA. So this could be information about another company or sector affecting BABA indirectly.

Since none of the tweets explicitly mention the stock symbol for BABA, it's tricky to determine how their content would impact its price. Each tweet seems to be discussing other topics or unrelated companies within the same company's ecosystem. Without knowing more about these discussions, I can't make a precise assessment on whether they're positive, negative, or neutral towards BABA.

Therefore, without direct information linking each tweet to BABA, it's impossible to conclude its impact. So I'll have to say Neutral because there's no concrete evidence of any positive or negative effect mentioned."
2014-07-16,Negative,"Alright, let's see. I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The tweets provided are:

1. ""alphabeta return not enough for yahoo traders URL via AT_USER $ baba $ yhoo""

First, I'll extract the target stock symbol from this tweet. It mentions YHOO, so that's Apple Inc. (YY). 

Now, I need to break down each tweet to assess positive or negative factors and sentiment towards investors.

For the first tweet: ""alphabeta return not enough for yahoo traders URL via AT_USER $ baba $ yhoo""

I can identify two potential factors here: 'alphabeta' which might be a typo for 'apple', 'traders', and possibly an 'URL'. 'TRADERS' could refer to Apple traders. The mention of YHOO suggests it's about the stock price.

Assuming 'traders' are investors, this tweet is likely expressing dissatisfaction with the performance of Apple's stock (YHOO). It seems like the company isn't meeting their expectations from traders, so there's negative sentiment here.

I'll look for any positive or neutral factors. The term 'URL' might be a placeholder or typo but doesn't seem relevant. There are no signs of growth, earnings reports, or new products mentioned. 

So, considering the main points: negative comments about stock performance and investor dissatisfaction. This would likely lead to a negative overall sentiment for the stock price.

Putting it all together, this tweet is clearly negative regarding the company's stock. Therefore, the impact on the stock price should be Negative."

2014-07-22,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the given company based on their provided tweets. The goal is to determine whether each tweet is positive, negative, or neutral in terms of its effect on the stock.

First, I'll take a look at the first tweet: ""$ yhoo please go down so i can buy more . $ yhoo is a lock to go to 38 after road show starts for $ baba"". This seems like a motivational push encouraging the user to sell YHOO because they think the stock will drop to 38. The mention of a road show starting could be an event that leads to higher or lower stock prices, but without knowing more about the company or the context, it's hard to assess definitively. However, since the user is encouraging them to buy more, this suggests a positive action.

Moving on to the second tweet: ""The $1 billion dollar note from China will make the global economy worse for 5 years."" This sounds like a negative statement because it mentions an event that could have adverse effects on the economy. This is particularly concerning as economic issues often impact corporate earnings and stock prices. A warning about a potentially detrimental event might lead to a negative overall sentiment.

Now, considering both tweets together, there's a mix of encouragement for selling (positive) and a warning about a potential bad economic outcome (negative). It's a bit ambiguous whether these are separate events or related. If they're separate, the positive tweet could counteract the negative one, leading to a neutral overall sentiment. However, if they're concurrent concerns, the strong positive push might outweigh the negative economic worry, making it possible for the stock price to rise.

I also need to consider that YHOO's stock is mentioned in both tweets, which suggests it's likely a well-known company. The context of a road show and an economic warning could influence investor reactions, but without specifics on the industry or the company's fundamentals, it's challenging to make a definitive conclusion. However, given the direct calls to action in the first tweet, there's more buy power for the stock than any negative information presented.

I think the positive tweet is strong enough to create some momentum, and even though the second tweet is concerning, the combination might not outweigh the positive sentiment. Therefore, it could be considered neutral or slightly positive overall."
2014-07-23,Negative,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets about the company's stock price impact and decide if it's positive, neutral, or negative.

First, looking at the tweet: ""yhoo $ yhoo about time $ yhoo stop looking into rearview mirror , look forward poss . $ baba or $ sftbf takeout , at least $ $ $ from ipo kaboom"". Hmm, that seems a bit jumbled. It starts with yhoo and some symbols, which might not be the stock symbol. Maybe it's referring to a company called YHOO, but without knowing the actual company name, I can't really know what's going on.

Then there are mentions of ""takeout"" and ""ipo kaboom,"" which sounds like a plan to sell a lot of shares at a IPO (Initial Public Offering). That would definitely be positive because taking out shares means they're getting more money, so the stock might go up. But I also see some negative words like ""stop looking into rearview mirror."" Maybe the author is avoiding making a decision or questioning their position.

Wait, maybe it's about stock performance, and the takeout is a strategy to boost the company's value. So overall, there are positive elements but some conflicting thoughts. The final part mentions an IPO kaboom, which suggests the company might be preparing for a major public offering, which could drive up the stock price.

Putting it all together, while there are positive factors like taking out shares and the potential of a large IPO, the mention of ""stop looking"" might be confusing or conflicting. However, overall, the takeout strategy is likely to have some positive impact on the stock."

2014-07-25,Positive,"Alright, let's see what I need to do here. The user provided some tweets and wants me to determine their likely impact on a company's stock price. They gave an example with specific steps and output, so I should follow that structure.

First, the task is straightforward: extract the stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet, it mentions ""AT_USER mobile sales send baidu stock to all-time highs URL via AT_USER $ bidu $ baba."" The stock name here seems to be Baidu. So, I'll focus on analyzing tweets related to Baidu's stock.

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. Then assess the sentiment based on those factors. Finally, combine them to give an overall sentiment of [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative].

The first tweet talks about mobile sales sending Baidu stock to all-time highs via a URL with specific symbols. That seems like good news because it's showing increased activity and positive market sentiment.

I should check if there are any other tweets provided? No, the user only gave this one. So I'll just analyze this one tweet thoroughly.

Positive factors here include increased mobile sales, which likely affects Baidu's revenue or trading volume. Positive sentiment might come from investors believing that mobile usage is growing, leading to more interest in their stock.

There's no negative factor mentioned here. It doesn't mention anything bad happening related to the stock performance.

So, overall, it seems like there's a positive impact because of the increased activity and potential growth. Therefore, the sentiment should be [Positive].

I need to make sure I'm only considering this tweet and not others. Since only one tweet is provided, my analysis is solely based on that. Also, the user emphasized using the exact tag, so I have to ensure it's [Positive] without any deviations.

Wait, does ""all-time highs"" imply anything about the stock? It could mean that there are expected strong performance dates approaching, which might create buzz and positive sentiment. That makes sense as a positive indicator.

No negative news mentioned here, so no impact on investor confidence from that tweet.

Therefore, combining all this, I'll conclude with [Positive] as the overall sentiment for the Baidu stock based on the provided tweet."

2014-07-29,Negative,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for a given company. Let me go through this step by step.

First, the user provided four tweets that mention ""baba growth"" and talks about buybacks of another company called AT_USER. The target stock is BABA, so I'll need to focus on how these tweets relate to BABA.

Looking at the first tweet: ""1. AT_USER i see huge buybacks + $ baba growth leading yhoo to $ 50 possibly $ 60-70"". Hmm, wait, there's a mix of words here. It mentions BABA and YHOO. Maybe that's a typo? I should check if it's AT_USER or something else. If it's AT_USER, then this tweet is talking about their buybacks from another company, YHOO. That doesn't directly impact BABA. So maybe the main point here is about AT_USER. But since we're focused on BABA, perhaps it's irrelevant for this analysis.

The second tweet: ""2. AT_USER i see huge buybacks + $ baba growth leading yhoo to $ 50 possibly $ 60-70"". Same as the first one, same issue with YHOO mentioned instead of BABA. I'm not sure what's being sold here. It might be that this tweet is also about AT_USER's buybacks but again, for a different stock.

The third tweet: ""3. AT_USER i see huge buybacks + $ baba growth leading yhoo to $ 50 possibly $ 60-70"". Again, same problem with YHOO. Maybe it's the same as before; perhaps there are multiple tweets about BABA, but they're mistakenly mentioning other stocks.

The fourth tweet: ""4. AT_USER i see huge buybacks + $ baba growth leading yhoo to $ 50 possibly $ 60-70"". Same issue here too. So it seems all these tweets are talking about different stocks (YHOO) and may be discussing AT_USER's buybacks, which doesn't directly relate to BABA.

Since none of the tweets specifically mention or talk about BABA growth for that company, I don't think they have any impact on BABA. The main point seems to be about AT_USER and their buybacks. Therefore, these tweets are not relevant to BABA's performance or stock price movement.

Putting it all together, even though each tweet is about different stocks (YHOO), there's no mention of BABA growth. So the sentiment towards BABA would be neutral since none of the factors relate to its performance."
2014-07-30,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me start by looking at each tweet and see if I can identify any factors or sentiments.

First tweet: ""rt AT_USER there is no way in hell Snapchat is worth 10 billion $ baba"" Hmm, it looks like this one mentions "" Snapchat is worth 10 billion dollars."" That's a significant amount of money. The use of ""baba"" might be a typo for ""Baba"" as in BABA stock, but I'm not entirely sure. Also, the mention of a high value seems pretty strong. If someone thinks Snapchat isn't worth that much, they might have negative sentiment towards the stock.

Second tweet: ""rt AT_USER there is no way in hell snapchat is worth 10 billion $ baba"" Wait, that's the same as the first one? Or maybe it's a different person's tweet. Let me check again. It seems identical to the first. So both tweets are pointing out the same thing.

Now, looking at the factors: The first tweet is negative because it suggests Snapchat isn't worth much. The second tweet might be redundant or just repeating the same information. Since they're about the same stock symbol (BABA) and mention a high value of Snapchat, which probably influences investor sentiment negatively.

Assessing sentiment: Both tweets are directly related to BABA and highlight the low value perception of Snapchat. That's a clear negative sign for the stock price.

So combining these factors, each tweet is pointing out that the stock is overpriced in terms of Snapchat. Investors might be selling off their positions because they see this as a potential loss in value. This should lead to a negative sentiment affecting the stock price."
2014-07-31,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given tweet is positive, neutral, or negative in relation to the stock price of a company. The tweet says: ""rt AT_USER we're starting to collect estimates for alibaba $ baba ahead of its ipo in the fall , this quarter closes thursday URL.""

First, let's break down what each part means. The user is mentioning ""AT_USER,"" which might be an abbreviation or typo, perhaps for ""Apple."" Then it says they're collecting estimates for Alumably, a stock (probably BABA, which I think stands forbeta baseballaba?), ahead of its IPO in the fall. The tweet also mentions that this quarter will close on Thursday and provides a URL.

So, focusing on the stock aspect: they're planning to gather estimates before the IPO in the fall. An IPO is an Initial Public Offering, so it's likely about going public. If someone is collecting estimates for the IPO, especially preparing for it, that might indicate optimism because they're anticipating something significant and want information upfront.

Now, considering the overall impact on the stock price: if a company is about to go public, investors often react positively because they expect capital raises or changes in management. This could lead to an upward trend in the stock price as people wait for the IPO.

The tweet doesn't mention any negative news related to BABA itself, just more about their preparations and the upcoming event. There's no obvious warning signs like earnings reports or product launches that might indicate a negative outlook. The user is focusing on the potential of the IPO rather than any issues with the stock.

Additionally, while the tweet does provide a URL for more details, it doesn't seem to contain any critical information about the company's financial performance or other external factors affecting its value. Therefore, it's unlikely that this tweet carries strong negative sentiment towards BABA or the stock in question.

Putting it all together: the user is showing anticipation and positive preparation for an upcoming event, which can lead to a rise in the stock price as investors wait to see the details of the IPO."

2014-08-07,Neutral,"Alright, let me figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on stock price for BABA (Baba Inc.).

First, I'll look at each tweet separately.

1. The first tweet says, ""no idea where $ baba will price & trade . probably above $20 . but if it falls to $13 - $19 range ? it's only teenage wasteland !"". Hmm, this seems like a negative statement. It mentions that BABA is likely priced above $20 but has a bad outlook for the short term. The mention of ""teenagers wasteland"" is concerning and suggests a lack of confidence in its future performance.

2. The second tweet is ""Baba's product has been selling really well, they're on sale now."" This seems positive because it talks about ongoing success and discounts, which generally indicates good demand or a strong market position.

3. The third tweet reads, ""the board of directors are going to make big decisions soon - maybe something bad happens"". Again, this is negative because it's talking about significant decisions that could have an adverse effect on the company.

Putting these together: The first tweet is negative due to outlook and negative outlook. The second is positive with good news. The third is definitely negative with future decisions. So there's a mix of mixed signals—some positive, some negative.

Overall, it seems like the sentiment isn't consistent, but the negative tweets are more frequent or stronger than the positive one. Therefore, I'm leaning towards a neutral conclusion because while there are both positive and negative factors, the negative ones are still significant enough to influence investor sentiment."

The first tweet is ""rt AT_USER alibaba restructures alipay agreement ; yahoo ticks higher $ baba $ yhoo $ sftbf $ sftby URL"". I notice that it's a link to some tweets, but mostly, the key part seems to be the alignment of Yahoo stock symbols with BABA and YHOO. Aligning the stock symbols can sometimes indicate confidence in the company or its direction, which might mean expectations are changing.

Now looking at how this affects the overall sentiment. The user is restructures their alipay agreement, but more importantly, they're aligning their Yahoo stock symbols with different companies (BABA and YHOO). This could be a signal to investors that there's some expectation movement or regulatory changes that might influence the stock price.

But I'm not sure about the exact sentiment here. It seems like it's just pointing out market movements for specific stocks, so maybe not changing the overall view too much. The alignment of symbols isn't necessarily positive or negative on its own; it could be part of a larger trend but doesn't directly state if the stock is going up or down.

I don't see any strong positive or negative indicators here. It's more about market data than news affecting the stock price itself. So I think this tweet might just be a distraction or pointing out specific movements without influencing the overall sentiment much."

2014-08-16,Neutral,"Okay, so I have to figure out how these tweets are affecting the stock price for a company. The user provided two tweets and asked me to determine if they'll be positive, neutral, or negative in their impact on the stock.

First, let's look at the first tweet: ""china fraud : full carson block interview : hard to trust alibaba's & other chinese cos . numbers : URL $ baba"". It seems like this tweet is a mix of information about China's fraud, an interview from a person named Carson Block, and mentions of Alibaba and Chinese companies. The term ""hard to trust"" suggests that there might be some concerns or questions about their reliability or performance.

Then the second tweet: ""solving process > [Positive]"", but it seems like this one is more general and doesn't provide specific details about the stock in question. It just states a positive overall sentence without mentioning the stock symbol or any context related to that stock.

So, from my understanding, without knowing which stock they're referring to, I can't directly assess its impact on that particular stock's price. The first tweet is about other entities, and the second is too vague. To determine sentiment, I need more specific information about what these tweets mean for a given company's stock.

Maybe the user wants me to assume that the first tweet relates to a specific stock they're tracking? Or perhaps it's part of a broader context that I'm missing. Without more context, it's hard to say whether this tweet is positive or negative towards any particular stock. Similarly, the second tweet doesn't provide any information about the stock itself.

I should consider that without knowing which stock the tweets are referring to, my analysis might not be accurate. The goal here is to determine the impact on a specific stock, so I need more details. Maybe I can only assess the first tweet if it's tied to that stock, but since there's no link provided, I have to leave it as neutral.

So, in summary, without specific context about the stock these tweets are referring to, I can't confidently rate their impact on its stock price. The second tweet is too vague for that purpose."
2014-08-17,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. The user provided some tweets and asked me to determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll start by identifying the target stock from each tweet. It seems like each tweet refers to a specific stock symbol. From the tweets, I can see that one mentions ""marissa mayer's compensation and stock selling not linked to performance URL via AT_USER $ yhoo $ baba $ a …"". So the stock here is YHOO.

Next, for each relevant tweet, I need to separate Positive and Negative factors. Each tweet seems to mention different factors:

1. For YHOO's tweet: ""Marissa mayer's compensation and stock selling not linked to performance URL via AT_USER.""
   - The word ""linkage"" suggests a potential negative link between Marissa Mayer and the stock's performance.
   - Also, mentions of stock selling might indicate that people are selling their stocks.

2. Additionally, I don't see any other relevant tweets mentioned in this case. So maybe just focus on YHOO's tweet.

Now, assessing the sentiment. The tweet talks about someone else (Marissa Mayer) and how her actions aren't linked to performance, which is a negative note. It also mentions stock selling, which can be seen as potential negative behavior because it affects the company's value and stock price.

Putting this together, the tweet presents information that might lead investors to see either positive or negative outcomes for the stock. Since Marissa Mayer isn't known for good financial performance, and she's mentioned in a way that implies her actions aren't linked to the stock's success, it leans towards a negative sentiment among investors.

Therefore, considering the factors and sentiments, this tweet is likely negative."

2014-08-19,Positive,"Okay, let me figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. The task is to analyze each tweet and categorize it as positive, neutral, or negative.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""ali $ baba proxy dongxiang ( hk . 3818 ) up 3 % after AT_USER tips undervalued play on mega ipo . URL""

Hmm, this seems like a mix of stock symbols and some typos. The word ""dongxiang"" might be a typo for Hong Kong or a different city. Also, the tweet mentions that the proxy is undervalued and points out a mega IPO. These are positive signs because an IPO can attract investors, increase visibility, and boost earnings, which generally leads to higher stock prices. A 3% up movement after this could indicate some positivity about upcoming news.

Now, considering each part:
- The mention of an IPO seems impactful.
- Tips undervalued suggests the company is being seen as a good investment opportunity.
- Positive sentiment from the user might influence investor behavior.

Putting that together, the overall impact should be positive because the company is underappreciated in terms of its upcoming IPO. This could drive up the stock price significantly.

I think I agree with the first tweet and don't see any negative aspects here. So, the conclusion should be positive."

2014-08-22,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given tweet will positively, neutrally, or negatively impact the stock price of a company. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol, it seems to be ""baba internet."" So the company is likely related to BABA stocks. The tweet provided is: ""check out the new website ! URL AT_USER you da man ! amazing work . china etf $ baba internet""

Alright, I'm a bit confused about what the tweet is suggesting for their stock. It mentions checking out the new website and including the company name, but it's unclear if that relates to BABA stocks specifically or just general information.

Now, looking at each tweet: there are two relevant factors here. The first part talks about the new website and user interactions, which seems like a positive aspect because more users likely mean they're expanding their reach. The second part mentions ""china etf"" which I think stands for China ETFs—maybe referring to index funds or mutual funds in China.

So, positive factors are about having a better website (expanding reach) and mentioning China ETFs. But there's also something negative: the symbol ""$ baba internet."" That could be misleading because it might cause confusion about which stock is being referred to. It's unclear if that refers to BABA or something else.

Next, assessing sentiment from each tweet. The first part seems positive—expanding website and user engagement. The second part mentions China ETFs, which are generally seen as positive indicators for diversification and growth potential. However, the mention of the stock symbol is confusing, so I can't be sure if it's a typo or intentional.

Putting this together: There's a mix of positive elements like better reach and international exposure but a negative aspect due to unclear stock reference. Since there are no strong negatives outweighing positives, the overall sentiment seems neutral."
2014-08-23,Negative,"Alright, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company, specifically [Baba], which has the symbol $ yhoo.

First, looking at the tweet: ""rt AT_USER yahoo outlook is fantastic after alibaba ipo in september URL $ baba $ yhoo""

I'll start by extracting the target stock symbol. The words mentioned are ""Yahoo"" and ""ŷ"", but I'm not sure if ""ŷ"" stands for anything meaningful here. Given that the output should be [BABA], it's likely that ""ŷ"" is a typo or placeholder for the actual symbol, which might be $ yhoo.

Next, I'll analyze each tweet to identify Positive (P) and Negative (N) factors. The tweet seems positive overall because it mentions an ""outlook"" from Yahoo after their IPO in September, which is a significant event that could influence investor sentiment. It also ends with a URL indicating the stock's price, suggesting that investors are concerned about changes in the company's performance.

Now, breaking down the factors:
- Positive: The outlook from Yahoo and the IPO event likely encourage investors to buy the stock.
- Negative: There doesn't seem to be any negative information here. The tweet is encouraging without mentioning anything negative.

Considering these points, the overall sentiment is positive because the tweet provides good info that could increase investor confidence in the company's future performance."

2014-08-27,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on stock price. I'm not super familiar with all the market trends or financial terms, so I'll need to take it step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol. The first tweet says ""baba gtfho mm ... vanity fair .."". Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. Maybe it's referring to BABA, which is a company I'm familiar with as an energy provider. So perhaps that's the stock in question here? Alternatively, it could be something else, but given the context of revenue and valuation metrics like FCFF, I think BABA is likely.

So, the target stock is BABA, specifically BABA GTFHO, which might be a different instance or perhaps a typo. I'll proceed with BABA as my focus.

Now, for each tweet:

1. ""rt AT_USER what can i do now $ baba gtfho mm ... vanity fair ..""
This seems like a casual message from someone on Twitter asking for advice. It mentions ""what can i do now,"" which suggests they're looking for guidance or information on how to proceed. The use of "" fairness"" and ""vanity"" might indicate concerns about the stock's value or market conditions.

2. ""rt AT_USER $ fb fcf in q2 = $ 872m $ baba fcf in q2 = $ 1.7 b""
This tweet is more formal, mentioning financial metrics. It says revenue in Q2 for BABA was $872 million and FCFF (free cash flow from operations) was $1.7 billion. These numbers are significant because they're related to the stock's valuation.

3. ""alibaba revenue soars ahead of ipo $ baba URL""
This seems like a tweet announcing that Alibaba's revenue has surpassed their IPO (Initial Public Offering). It mentions the company and the event, which is usually a positive sign for investors. This could indicate strong financial performance and potential growth.

Now, let me break down each tweet:

1. The first tweet is more of a promotional or questionative message. It doesn't provide any specific information about BABA's future. It might be advising the user on what to do next, which could influence short-term sentiment but probably not a strong enough signal for stock price.

2. The second tweet provides financial metrics from Q2. Positive numbers can generally lead to positive sentiment as they show growth and potential upside. However, it doesn't provide information about upcoming earnings or market expectations beyond this point. It's important to consider if these numbers are due to a specific event or not.

3. The third tweet is even more positive with revenue surpassing their IPO. This could be seen as a strong indicator of the company's ability to grow and perform well, which is typically good for investors. It might suggest that BABA is poised for continued success in the industry.

Considering all three tweets together, the second one gives concrete financial data, which is usually a strong point for analysis. The third tweet adds another positive trend but doesn't specify whether it's due to an event or just normal growth. The first tweet seems more about the user than BABA itself.

So, putting this together: There's some information on financial performance that could be positive, especially with revenue surpassing their IPO. However, the first tweet might not provide a lot of context relevant to BABA's future stock price. Therefore, the overall sentiment is likely [Neutral] because while there are positive factors, they're somewhat separate and not directly related to BABA's core operations or market position."
2014-08-28,Neutral,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has given two tweets and wants to determine their impact on the stock price of a company using three categories: [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""this guy said people would sell $ yhOO to buy $ baba . when asked if he would , he said no as he had plenty of cash URL"". It mentions YHOO and BABA stocks. Since it's about a person advising investors on buying BABA, I think the company is likely ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) provider or related to financial instruments.

The second tweet: ""mobile sales lift alibaba profit nearly threefold , ahead of i . p . o . URL $ baba"". This talks about Alibaba and mentions selling BABA. Again, this is pointing towards a similar company, possibly BABA or ETFs based on BABA.

Next, I need to analyze each tweet for Positive (P), Negative (N), or Neutral (O) factors. 

For the first tweet, it's advising others on whether someone would sell YHOO in exchange for BABA, which is a bit vague about sentiment. The person advises against buying BABA due to having cash, but the overall implication seems neutral because it doesn't clearly state if they're encouraging or discouraging actions based on the situation.

The second tweet mentions that Alibaba's profit has nearly tripled compared to its previous year and is ahead of others. This positive statement suggests strong fundamentals, which is a good sign for stock price movement. But since the tweet is more about Alibaba than BABA, it doesn't directly address the company in question, making it somewhat neutral.

Putting this together, while the second tweet has a positive note on Alibaba's profitability, the first tweet provides some context but isn't a strong enough factor to tip the overall sentiment. The overall impact seems mostly positive from the profit statement, so I lean towards [Positive]."
2014-08-29,Missing,File not found
2014-08-30,Negative,"Alright, I need to determine the likely impact on the stock price of the company based on the provided tweets. Let's break down each tweet step by step.

First, identify the target stock from the tweets. The main name appears in the second tweet: ""AT_USER AT_USER $ twtr ipo"". So, the stock symbol is likely TWTR or $29 if it was mentioned elsewhere. Wait, looking again, I see ""twtr"" as a currency code? Maybe that's just part of the tweet, and the actual stock might be something else. Hmm, maybe I should focus on the other tweets since they are more specific.

Looking at the first tweet: ""$ baba URL"". That doesn't seem relevant to any known company, so perhaps it's not the target stock. The second tweet mentions a TWTR IPo with a price of $29 and reports about $45. But without knowing the stock symbol, it's hard to analyze.

The third tweet talks about TTM revenue for BABA ($baba) at ~$9.3 billion in 2014, based on growth rates over the last six quarters. The user also mentions that its calendar 2014 revenue will be closer to $12b. 

I need to figure out if this affects TWTR. But without knowing what's being referred to here, maybe I should focus on other tweets. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo and the stock is TWTR or another company.

Wait, perhaps ""twtr"" was part of the previous tweet? Let me check: No, the first tweet doesn't mention a stock symbol with $.

Hmm, maybe this is a mix-up. Since I can only analyze the tweets provided, let's focus on each one individually. For the third tweet about revenue, if it's from BABA, which might be a different company, then the impact would depend on its financial performance relative to previous quarters. If TWTR's stock hasn't been mentioned yet, maybe this is too early.

Alternatively, perhaps there's more context or another tweet that I missed? Since the user provided only three tweets, and only one mentions $baba, I might have incomplete information here.

Given that, it's challenging to assess the impact on TWTR because we don't know the target stock. Without knowing what ""twtr"" refers to, it's impossible to determine its stock price movement. So maybe this tweet is irrelevant for determining the stock's future price.

Therefore, I can't make a conclusion based on these tweets alone."
2014-08-31,Missing,File not found
2014-09-01,Neutral,"Alright, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of BABA. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol from the first tweet: $baba. So that's clear, we're talking about BABA. Now, for each tweet, I have to identify positive and negative factors and assess their impact.

Looking at tweet 1: ""everyone has to wait till next week to get their piece of $ baba URL"". Hmm, that seems a bit off-topic. It mentions a URL but doesn't clearly indicate any action or investment intent. Maybe it's trying to promise something, like a future event related to the stock? Not sure if this affects the current stock price much.

Next tweet 2: ""$ yhOO should be active going to the middle of september due to $ baba ipo . $ 43 possible by mid september . free gift . $ twtr and $ aapl on watch."" This one talks about an IP IPO related to BABA, mentioning some gains and mentions TWTR and Adepta. It seems like it's encouraging investors around September 43rd. That could be positive because they're suggesting something tangible happening. Maybe this leads people to invest, which would be a good sign for the stock.

Tweet 3: ""rt AT_USER ""unleash the hounds . alibaba frenzy month to begin "" URL $ baba $ amzn $ bidu $ ebay ipo"". This one is more about promoting BABA and also suggests something with Alibaba. It looks like it's encouraging people to follow the user, which could lead to increased activity on their platform. Since they're linking BABA to a company that's expanding or doing well, this might boost confidence in the stock.

Putting it all together: The first tweet is less clear, but tweets 2 and 3 both seem to be promoting BABA, suggesting an IP IPO and encouraging others to follow. While tweet 1 doesn't directly impact the stock price as much, maybe some effect exists through word-of-mouth or expectations, but it's not a major factor. Tweets 2 and 3 are clearly supportive and positive."
2014-09-02,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of $BABA. Let's start by identifying the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at tweet 1: ""rt AT_USER ipo de alibaba $ baba el 08/09 . quizás el 17 o 18 cotice ya . podría haber presión en empresas de internet chinas para su sustitu …"". It seems like the stock symbol is $BABA. 

Next, I'll break down each tweet to find positive and negative factors. For tweet 1, ""ipo"" means an initial public offering, which could be significant but also possibly disruptive. The mention of China's influence suggests it might affect the company negatively if they're competing or have a dominant presence. Then there are mentions like ""sustitu"" which I'm not familiar with, perhaps typo for ""substitute""? It seems speculative.

Moving on to tweet 2: ""AT_USER $ amzn sell off to free up cash for $ baba ? ?"". This looks like a selling offer to buy more shares, expecting to get into the market. The use of $ and mentioning free cash suggests a positive action, possibly expecting the stock to rise.

Tweet 3 says ""renaissance ipo index closes at record high 1wk ahead of alibaba road show - a good omen for $ baba ipo ? AT_USER URL"". Again, ""ipo"" is mentioned, so I'm unsure about the impact. The road show part might be referring to some event in Alibaba's market presence. If it's a positive sign, that could boost the stock.

Now, assessing each tweet's sentiment. Tweet 1 seems uncertain, with mixed factors but not sure if it's positive or negative. Tweet 2 is clearly selling off shares, which typically can lead to positive sentiment and higher stock price. Tweet 3 also mentions an ipo, so without more info, it's hard to say, but the ""good omen"" suggests a positive outlook.

Putting it all together: tweet 1 has mixed factors with some uncertainty, tweet 2 is very sell-oriented, which could push up the price, and tweet 3, if it's optimistic, would add more support. The strongest factor might be tweet 2's clear action to buy shares."
2014-09-03,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of alibaba.com. Let me start by understanding what each tweet is saying.

First tweet: ""alibaba stock is expected to begin trading on the new york stock exchange in less than a fortnight URL $ baba $ amzn $ yhoo."" It looks like they're just announcing that the stock will be listed soon, maybe tomorrow or Friday. That's generally positive because it means the company might be expanding its market reach. Companies getting more international exposure usually have higher valuations and can benefit from increased demand.

Second tweet: ""rt AT_USER your fave cio tweeter AT_USER tells AT_USER + AT_USER $ baba ipo windfall * not * priced-in to $ yhoo . http …"" This one is a bit confusing. It mentions that AT_USER faves a user on Twitter, and they're telling another user about BABA investing with a windfall, which isn't priced in yet for YHOO. I'm not sure what this means exactly. The presence of a windfall could indicate potential growth or appreciation, but it's unclear if that's positive or negative news. It might be speculative or unrelated to the stock price directly.

Considering both tweets together: The first one is definitely good news because it gives investors time before the stock starts trading. The second tweet is ambiguous and doesn't provide clear information about BABA's performance relative to YHOO. It could either boost confidence in the stock or maybe indicate a strategy, but without more context, it's hard to assess its impact.

Looking at the overall sentiment, the first tweet alone suggests a positive outlook for alibaba.com. The second tweet adds uncertainty or speculation, which might slightly tilt the sentiment towards neutral because it shows potential interest from different investors but doesn't necessarily confirm BABA's performance. However, since the first tweet is concrete and expected information, it likely has a stronger positive effect.

Therefore, despite the ambiguity in the second tweet, the overall impact seems predominantly positive due to the soon-trading announcement."

2014-09-05,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided six tweets related to alibaba's IPO and their corresponding BATS values. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol. Looking through the tweets, the only one that mentions ""baba"" is tweet 1, which says shares will start trading between $60 and $66 with a valuation of $165 billion. The other tweets mention AT_USER or YHOO instead, so maybe I should focus on those. Wait, actually, some tweets talk about $ yhoo, but that might be a typo since it's supposed to be baba.

So, the target stock is likely ""baba"". Now, I'll go through each tweet one by one and assess their factors.

1. ""alibaba $ baba - shares to start trading on sept 19 price to be set between $60 - $66 based on 2.5 billion shrs valuing the company at $165b."" This mentions a future trading date, valuation range of $165 billion. The value is up from $150 billion in their previous IPO, so that's positive.

2. ""rt AT_USER ok then , weekend required viewing : the alibaba story - crocodile in the yangtze URL $ baba $ yhoo $ sfbty."" This seems like a promotional tweet on Twitter. It doesn't mention trading or stock changes, just encouraging viewers to watch and mentions three companies: Crocodile in the Yangtze (which might be another IPO), YHOO, and SFBTY. The language is more positive and encourages engagement.

3. ""rt AT_USER the alibaba roadshow kicks off on monday in nyc followed by 11 stops across the globe » URL $ baba URL."" This talks about an event where alibaba's roadshow starts in NYC and goes to 11 other countries. It doesn't mention trading or stock changes, so it's more about a planned event.

4. ""rt AT_USER alibaba $ baba price range on ipo said to be $60 - $66 $ $ $ yhoo."" This mentions the IPO price range and a YHOO valuation of $200 billion. The stock is expected to go up from $150 billion, which adds to positive sentiment.

5. ""and the sentiment in social media chatter on alibaba $ baba still bullish . URL alibabaipo URL."" The tweet says social media is bullish, so this reinforces the positive impact of the IPO.

6. ""rt AT_USER breaking : alibaba group $ baba valued at $162.7 billion and likely to be the largest ipo in the u . s . ever !"" This provides a specific value and makes a bold statement that it's the largest IPO in the U.S. up ahead, which is very positive.

Now, summarizing each tweet's impact:
- Tweet 1: Positive.
- Tweet 2: Positive (encouraging engagement).
- Tweet 3: Not directly about trading or stock changes; more about an event.
- Tweets 4 and 5: Both positive because they provide expected price ranges and bold statements.
- Tweet 6: Also positive with specific numbers.

Since all tweets are either selling the IPO, encouraging media attention, mentioning an upcoming event, or making bold statements about the company's success, the overall sentiment is positive. There's no negative or neutral indication here."
2014-09-06,Neutral,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to assess the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company, which I'll assume is alibaba.com since it's mentioned in the first tweet.

Starting with the first tweet: ""as its initial offering nears , alibaba gets ready for a splashy debut URL via AT_USER ageofambition $ baba."" Hmm, this seems to be promoting the initial offering of alibaba. The word ""splashy"" suggests excitement and potential growth. I'm not sure about the specifics here, but it does sound positive.

The second tweet is a bit more vague: ""$ baba cramer : has nobody noticed elephant in market ? it's what's after alibaba that has me worried , "" URL $ spx $ study $ $. This one looks like it's making some sort of investment or stock analysis. The mention of an ""elephant in the market"" might indicate potential issues, but then there are some terms like ""studies"" and ""$ study"". Maybe this tweet is suggesting that after alibaba, another company (baba) will be studied? I'm not entirely sure how this affects investors.

The third tweet: ""rt AT_USER 4 of 6 alibaba banks are american . we should be happy us still dominates . $ baba"" This seems to express optimism. It mentions that four out of six banks at Alibaba are from the United States, and they're doing well. The use of ""will still dominate"" implies a strong market presence, which could boost confidence in the stock.

The fourth tweet: ""rt AT_USER breaking : alibaba to set ipo range at $ 60 - $ 66 • URL ( via AT_USER $ baba URL."" This is likely making an announcement about the company's IPO range. If they're setting it between $60 and $66, that could be a significant target in the stock market. Investors might be more optimistic if there are specific price targets set.

Now, summarizing each tweet: The first is positive about the launch but not very detailed. The second seems like speculative analysis or investment news, which could have mixed feelings. The third is optimistic about their US presence, and the fourth is about setting a stock target.

Considering all these factors, I think the overall sentiment is mixed. While there's some optimism in the third tweet, the second one adds uncertainty. Without more context on how each tweet affects investor sentiment directly, it's hard to say for sure. But combining all the positive points like having a US presence and specific stock targets might suggest a positive impact, but the lack of clarity in the second tweet makes it uncertain."
2014-09-07,Positive,"Alright, let's see what I need to do here. The task is to analyze these tweets to determine if they affect the stock price of a company. The possible sentiments are positive, neutral, or negative. 

First, looking at the target stock symbol from the tweets—it's BABA. So the stock in question is BABA. Now, all the tweets mention something about Alibaba and its IPO. Each tweet says something different but seems to be related to Alibaba going public.

Looking at tweet 1: It says there's an interactive guide for Alibaba, with URLs provided. That sounds like a marketing effort to let people know they can participate in their IPO. So this is a positive signal because it's making investors aware of the company's plans, which might boost confidence and stock price.

Tweets 2 and 3 are repeating the same thing as tweet 1 but again about Alibaba. It seems like a repeated announcement or update on the IPO progress, so that adds more positive information.

Tweets 4 and 5 are also similar to the others—another interactive guide for Alibaba. This repetition could be to ensure stakeholders know about the IPO details, reinforcing the positive outlook.

Now, each tweet is talking about how the IPO will happen on specific dates with a target market cap of $160 billion. While the exact numbers don't directly impact the stock price by themselves, they might influence investor expectations. But since all tweets are focused on confirming the IPO's announcement and its scale, they're all positive.

Putting it together: Each tweet is boosting public knowledge about Alibaba's IPO, which can increase investor confidence. This would likely lead to a positive overall sentiment for BABA stock."
2014-09-08,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of $ baba. I'm not very familiar with all the nuances, but I can look at each tweet and see if there's any positive or negative information.

First tweet: ""something awesome must be happening at the waldorf $ baba $ yhoo."" That sounds like a general statement about something cool happening. It doesn't seem specific to $ baba, so maybe it's neutral because it could go either way without more info.

Second tweet: ""here's how the alibaba ipo could add billions to yahoo's market cap --> URL $ baba $ yhoo."" This one is interesting because it mentions an alibaba IPO and talks about adding billions. It sounds like a positive sign for Yahoo, especially if alibaba is expanding into other areas that Yahoo has control over. But I'm not sure how significant this is without knowing more about alibaba's business strategy.

Third tweet: ""alibaba who ? u . s . retail investors not that interested $ baba URL."" This one starts with a question and then mentions the U.S. retail investors' interest, which isn't related to $ baba. It seems like it's making an unrelated announcement, so probably negative because it doesn't directly impact Yahoo.

Fourth tweet: ""riding on alibaba's coattails , a renewed wave of investor interest sweeps u . s . - registered chinese companies : URL $ baba."" Again, mentions alibaba and investors in the U.S., specifically about Chinese companies. While Chinese companies could be a concern if they affect Yahoo's operations or financials, it's still more of an indirect positive because the broader tech sector is doing well.

Fifth tweet: ""rt AT_USER here's how the alibaba ipo could add billions to yahoo's market cap --> URL $ baba $ yhoo."" Similar to the second tweet, it directly mentions the IPO and a potential boost for Yahoo. This seems like a strong positive signal that could push the stock higher.

Sixth tweet: ""question for fundys . do you think $ yhoo is worth less than $ 50 / sh w / $ baba ipo & yahoo jpn stake?"" It's asking about the valuation of $ yhoo, which might indicate investor sentiment. If they think it's undervalued, that could be positive news.

Seventh tweet: ""$ baba ! , ... URL."" Just a random link without any specific information related to $ baba or its stock. It seems like a dummy link, so probably negative because no concrete information is being provided.

Eighth tweet: ""rt AT_USER reprise my ideal merger : alibaba $ baba buys o'reilly automotive $ orly . renames itself teenage wasteland $ who."" This sounds like a major announcement about a merger between two companies. If this happens, it could be a significant positive impact on Yahoo because of potential synergies and growth opportunities.

Ninth tweet: ""bloomberg intelligence's paul sweeney says $ baba , because of size , poses a lot of risk for investors : including china risk ; fin disclosure."" This explicitly mentions the size of $ baba, which is a big factor in investor risk. It suggests that the company might face significant risks, so this could be negative because it adds uncertainty.

Tenth tweet: ""$ yhoo + 5 % to new multi-year highs on $ baba roadshow underway today in nyc stocks stockaction ipo."" This mentions an increase in YHOO's price with a roadshow event. If the company is undergoing some kind of project or launch, this could be a positive sign for investors expecting growth.

Now, let me try to summarize. Tweets 2, 5, 8, and 10 talk about $ baba being targeted by alibaba's IPO or YHOO's IPO, which could boost the stock positively. Additionally, tweet 8 is a big announcement that might cause market reactions based on the merger details. However, tweet 9 mentions size as a risk factor, which adds some uncertainty. The overall sentiment seems mixed but leaning towards positive because there are several signs of potential growth and interest from different angles."
2014-09-09,Negative,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a set of tweets and wants me to determine their likely impact on a company's stock price using a scale of [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. However, looking at the tweets, none explicitly mention any specific stock. That's a problem because without knowing which stock we're talking about, it's hard to assess the impact on its price. Maybe I should look for other indicators, like company names or keywords related to the market.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one and try to extract relevant information. 

1. The first tweet mentions ""so what happens if $ baba buys out $ yhoo ? ! ? ! ?"", it seems like someone is talking about a potential outcome regarding BABA (beta爸爸) and YHOO (YouTube). This could affect both companies, but without knowing the context, I can't say much about their impact on each other.

2. The second tweet talks about asset managers in the US asking clients if they're inquiring about $ baba being a quarter of that for $ fb ipo … Wait, FB is Facebook. So this tweet is talking about investors or clients asking how many people are interested in BABA compared to another company (FB). This could indicate investor sentiment about BABA relative to FB, but again, without knowing the market context, it's speculative.

3. The third tweet says AT_USER i shorted yday at 341 & just covered. Maybe ""yday"" refers to YELLA (YTP), a stock. It mentions covering and shorting stocks related to Amazon. This could imply that there are rumors or developments affecting BABA, possibly influencing investor sentiment.

4. The fourth tweet is ""rt AT_USER here's the $ baba AT_USER roadshow presentation : URL."" This seems like a link to a presentation about BABA. It might be discussing earnings, news, or other upcoming events related to BABA. But without specifics on what these events are, it's hard to gauge the sentiment impact.

5. The fifth tweet is a direct link: ""rt AT_USER here's the $ baba AT_USER roadshow presentation : URL."" Similar to the fourth tweet, this suggests a discussion about BABA, possibly related to presentations or reports from its management. This could influence investor confidence but again, without specifics on what's happening, it's ambiguous.

6. The sixth tweet talks about today's market with keywords like tech, organic food, and banking in the news, citing specific stock symbols ($ aapl apple $ baba $ bbt $ bkyf $ gis $ hain $ wwav). This is broader and might be talking about general market trends across various sectors. It could indicate overall market sentiment but doesn't directly impact a specific stock.

Putting it all together, I realize without knowing which stock we're focusing on, it's impossible to assess the impact of these tweets on its price. The user has provided multiple unrelated mentions of BABA and other stocks, making this analysis challenging. Perhaps there's more context or details about which company is being discussed that could help me evaluate the sentiment accurately.

In summary, I think the information provided isn't sufficient because each tweet refers to a different stock or concept without specifying the target stock for analysis. Without this clarity, I can't determine whether each tweet contributes positively, neutrally, or negatively to the stock price."
2014-09-10,Positive,"Alright, so I need to analyze these tweets about a stock's potential impact on its future stock price. The user provided five tweets and specified that I should consider each tweet as part of a tweet-by-tweet analysis. Each tweet is supposed to be evaluated for positive, negative, or neutral factors.

First, let me look at the target stock symbol mentioned in all these tweets: $ baba. Wait, hold on, $ baba doesn't seem right. Usually, stock symbols start with letters like A for Amazon, not a dollar sign and lowercase 'baba'. Maybe that's a typo or something else, but I'll proceed with $baba as the symbol.

Now, the tweets provided are:

1. ""when people see alibab $ baba , they realize there are flaws in amazon's business model . wait till they see $ 80 phones from huawei ... $ aapl""  
2. ""rt AT_USER alibaba said to have already received enough orders to fully cover its ipo in first few roadshow meetings $ baba""  
3. ""mobile apps , movie studios , cloud software - - alibaba could buy it all : URL $ baba""  
4. ""rt AT_USER an interactive guide to alibaba : URL $ baba URL""  
5. ""rt AT_USER $ baba ipo : early reports of strong demand , institutions routinely ask for more than they receive ; will $ baba up price and / or …""

I'm assuming that the target stock symbol is actually ""Alibaba"", so maybe it's a typo in the tweets, such as missing $ signs. So I'll proceed with Alb to avoid confusion.

Starting with tweet 1: ""when people see alibab $ baba , they realize there are flaws in amazon's business model . wait till they see $ 80 phones from huawei ... $ aapl""  
Hmm, this seems to be discussing Amazon. The mention of ""alibiab,"" ""flawed business model,"" and ""phones from Huawei."" These are industry-specific terms. It talks about looking at other companies but focuses on Amazon. I don't see any positive or negative factors here that would affect the stock price; it's more about a discussion about Amazon, not a direct impact.

Next tweet 2: ""rt AT_USER alibaba said to have already received enough orders to fully cover its ipo in first few roadshow meetings $ baba""  
This seems like a response from Apple (Apple Inc., with symbol $$) to Alibaba. It mentions receiving enough orders for an IPO (Initial Public Offering). An IPO is when a company goes public, which is about raising capital. While I'm not entirely sure what the user is implying here—perhaps they're wondering if this will affect Alibaba's future? If it seems like a good signal that $baba may proceed with its IPO, this could be a positive sign. But since it's speculative and just a statement, maybe not enough to determine the overall sentiment.

Tweet 3: ""mobile apps , movie studios , cloud software - - alibaba could buy it all : URL $ baba""  
This looks like Alibaba (Alb) announcing an announcement about buying mobile applications, movie studios, or cloud software. These are technologies that could attract a significant amount of capital from Alibaba. If they acquire many companies in these sectors, the stock price might rise. However, without more context on how soon this will happen and whether it's beneficial for Alibaba, it's hard to say if this is positive or negative.

Tweet 4: ""rt AT_USER an interactive guide to alibaba : URL $ baba URL""  
This tweet seems to be a response from Apple to Alibaba. They are offering an interactive guide which could imply that they're exploring Alibaba further. This kind of announcement might not have a direct impact on the stock price but can sometimes lead to more collaboration and product development. However, it's still speculative without knowing if this leads to actual business opportunities.

Tweet 5: ""rt AT_USER $ baba ipo : early reports of strong demand , institutions routinely ask for more than they receive ; will $ baba up price and / or …""  
This is Apple announcing an IPO and has received positive media attention about strong demand. Institutions are asking for higher funding, which could affect the stock price. If there's optimistic news about demand and potential capital needs from Apple to go public, this might signal confidence in Alibaba's future and a possible rise in its stock price.

Now, putting it all together: The first tweet is about Amazon, but not directly impacting the stock. Tweet 2 mentions an IPO for Apple, which could indicate interest in Alibaba. Tweet 3 shows Alibaba acquiring tech companies, which could boost the stock.Tweet 4 is speculative but might lead to collaboration. Tweet 5 showsApple's interest in going public, which can affect their stock price but not necessarily the target stock of $baba.

Since there are multiple tweets that indicate potential interests in Alibaba and could lead to its growth, especially from the release of Apple's IPO, it seems like a positive signal for $baba. Therefore, I'm leaning towards a positive sentiment overall."
2014-09-11,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on BABA stock's future price.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. The first tweet says ""$ baba URL"", which doesn't seem to provide a clear stock name. The second tweet mentions ""AT_USER thanks for the retweet about our alibaba ipocontest - what's your guess for the $ baba closing bell price?"" So, I think the target stock is $BABA.

Next, I'll go through each relevant tweet one by one.

The first tweet has ""$ baba URL"". The text says ""Thanks for the retweet"" and mentions ""alibaba ipocontest"", which sounds like a contest or announcement. But it doesn't specify what this means or how it affects BABA. So, without more information, I can't really assess sentiment here.

The second tweet is ""AT_USER thanks for the retweet about our alibaba ipocontest - what's your guess for the $ baba closing bell price?"" It starts with a thank you and mentions an alibaba IPO contest. Alibaba is a big company in the Chinese e-commerce space, so maybe they're announcing something significant, perhaps their future strategy or expansion. The mention of an IPO could indicate a potential stock performance. But since there's no direct information about BABA's current price, it's hard to gauge if this tweet positively or negatively affects the stock.

I don't have enough context from these tweets to make a meaningful analysis. Both tweets are brief and lack detailed information. Therefore, I can't conclude whether they're positive, neutral, or negative towards BABA."
2014-09-12,Neutral,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to assess the impact of these tweets on the stock price of BABA. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet mentions that alibaba is initiating an outperform at wedbush with a price target of $80. That sounds like good news for investors, so positive sentiment starts building here.
2. The second tweet criticizes the Chinese e-commerce sector noting low float and suggests looking away from alibaba's IPO as a sign of market tops. This seems like it could be negative because it's making people watch past trends.
3. The third tweet is more conversational with users discussing their financials, which might not affect the stock price much on its own.
4. The fourth tweet talks about multiple global internet IPOs joining a $baba billion-dollar club. This directly relates to BABA and could be positive.
5. The fifth tweet mentions that alibaba is expected to IPO later in the week, specifically on quadruple witching. That sounds like it's coming soon, which might boost confidence.
6. The sixth tweet says ""market waiting on that!"" reinforcing the expectation of alibaba's IPO.
7. The seventh tweet from CNBC suggests taking $baba through $yhoo due to its volatility at open but claims no one will catch the 66 shares. This seems like a negative outlook, maybe anticipating growth despite price fluctuations.
8. The eighth tweet talks about BABA closing its IPo order books early and could set a higher price. That's positive news for investors.
9. The ninth tweet discusses 9/11 and other events with unrelated investments but mentions investing in $baba and $jmei. This might not directly impact BABA, so less likely to affect the stock significantly.
10. The tenth tweet says alibaba is closing its IPo order books early and could price above current range. This seems positive, building more confidence.
11. The eleventh tweet mentions that $baba is a behemoth, which usually leads to strong growth, so this is positive.
12. The twelfth tweet about BABA's IPO roadshow affecting major internet stocks, focusing on $baba and others. This could have short-term impacts but might not be enough for long-term trends.
13. The thirteenth tweet from AT_USER about the IPO of alibaba, suggesting it's a good sign and comparing it to another company, which is neutral as it's just another opinion.
14. The fourteenth tweet by AT_USER links BABA's IPO with $yhh.com, indicating potential growth but also some speculation.
15. The fifteenth tweet discusses whether Charlie could buy into $yhoo to reap benefits from $baba's IPO, which seems speculative and positive in terms of diversification but not necessarily affecting the stock price directly.
16. The sixteenth tweet mentions that $baba is hitting a new 8-year high and has grown by 20%, indicating strength but not necessarily good news for BABA itself.
17. The seventeenth tweet from CNBC says that everyone should stop asking about $baba because it's irrelevant, which seems like a clear negative outlook to avoid media attention.

Putting it all together, the tweets cover multiple angles: BABA's direct IPO expectations, market trends regarding alibaba's IPO, speculative investing in $yhoo, and some positive indicators. However, the overall sentiment seems mixed but leans towards a mix of positive factors that could drive up stock prices."
2014-09-13,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price. The tweet says someone is buying $ yhoo or $ sftby because they're ""the trendy way"" to play ""baba."" Hmm, I'm not exactly sure what ""proxy stock syndrome"" refers to here. Maybe it's something related to investing strategies? 

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol. The tweet mentions ""baba,"" so that might be the stock we're focusing on. So the stock symbol is likely BABA.

Next, looking at the factors in each tweet. It seems like this tweet is talking about trends and investment methods, which are both positive signs for the company. Buying stocks for trends can attract investors who are looking for diversification or growth opportunities, which usually increases the stock's value.

Assessing sentiment: The user is sharing information that promotes investments without specific mentions of any negative details like losses or decreased confidence. It seems like a helpful tip to new investors about how to play stocks trendily. So the sentiment here is generally positive towards the stock because it suggests advice that could lead to gains.

Combining the factors and sentiment, the overall impact on BABA's price would be likely Positive. Investors are encouraged to take advantage of trends, which can drive up stock prices."
2014-09-14,Missing,File not found
2014-09-15,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets about the stock price of BABA. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. **First tweet**: It's a poll where users are asking for their opinions on Alibaba's IPO price. This seems like it could influence investor sentiment positively because more people sharing opinions might increase trading activity.
   
2. **Second tweet**: The user is making money short YHOO. I'm not sure how that affects stock prices, but since they're selling positions, maybe it's about potential profit or loss.

3. **Third tweet**: Apple is being sold as a buy and hold strategy. This could be related to Alpha Network issues, which might impact the stock.

4. **Fourth tweet**: Alibaba plans to boost its IPO price based on strong demand. Strong demand sounds positive for the stock.

5. **Fifth tweet**: The user is looking at bid/ask spreads to see if there's a downside weakness. This could affect pricing and thus the stock, but it's not clear if it's good or bad.

6. **Sixth tweet**: They're ignoring naysayers about Alibaba's IPO. If there are negative reactions, this might create uncertainty for the stock price.

7. **Seventh tweet**: Warns shareholders about an upcoming IPO of BABA ahead of the company’s earnings. This is a classic warning sign that could be positive if they believe it will go well.

8. **Eighth tweet**: Questions why $BABA's effect affects other stocks like $SINAE, $YHOO, etc. It seems more about understanding broader market dynamics rather than immediate stock performance.

9. **Ninth tweet**: The user is wondering if their AlphaBet bet is better for YHOO and BABA. This could be a way to hedge bets, which might stabilize the stock but not necessarily affect its price directly.

10. **Tenth tweet**: They're saying no thanks and overloading several stocks. This looks like a buy signal where they think others are not going to react positively, possibly seeking gains.

11. **Eleventh tweet**: Similar to the tenth, another signal of buying more, probably anticipating positive reactions from other holders or looking for better opportunities.

Now, combining all these thoughts: The first tweet is about sentiment, the third is a warning, the fourth and sixth concern naysayers, the seventh is a call to watch (positive), the ninth and tenth are buy signals. There's a mix of buy signals and concerns but overall, they're more positive with some bearish aspects. However, the potential for more buy signals suggests it might stay positive. So, I think there's a mix that leans towards [Neutral]."
2014-09-16,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company based on the provided instructions. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""best chinese stock not named alibaba ? that would be baidu . no disrespect to $ baba . but $ bidu has proven track record . URL"". It mentions Baidu, so the target is Baidu.

Next, for each tweet, I'll separate positive and negative factors. Then assess the sentiment towards each factor before combining them to get an overall conclusion.

The second tweet says: ""AT_USER missed yesterday's show was looking forward to $ baba segment . what's a good buy limit for the first day ? makingmoney"". The word ""makingmoney"" suggests it might be about investment or trading, so positive sentiment here.

Third tweet: ""AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER amazon ... $ baba go for the volume ... market share ... slippery slope ... schussing"". No specific words about stock performance, but mentions of competitors and possible issues (""slippery slope""). Negative factors here, so negative sentiment overall.

Fourth tweet is a URL without text, so I can't assess it. Maybe missing data or irrelevant content from the user's side.

Fifth tweet: ""$ yhoo $ baba live coverage continues throughout the week w / interesting news breaking on here"". No specific stock information, just general reporting, positive sentiment overall.

Sixth tweet says: ""rt AT_USER trading yahoo in a post alibaba world URL via AT_USER $ yhoo $ baba URL"". Again, no stock details, focusing on tech and stock market trends. Positive sentiment.

Seventh tweet: ""AT_USER AT_USER another simple way to rebuild $ yhoo infrastructure (system + monitization ) , is working with $ baba having top infrastructure now ."". Clear mention of a company being rebuilt, positive sentiment here.

Eighth tweet is an HTML comment without text, so no data. Maybe a typo or irrelevant content from the user's side.

Ninth and tenth tweets are duplicates: both say ""rt AT_USER how a group of investors secretly stand to reap huge profits in alibaba ipo : URL $ baba URL"". These are all about alibaba IPO, positive sentiment because they mention potential gains.

Eleventh tweet: ""rt AT_USER how a group of investors secretly stand to reap huge profits in alibaba ipo : URL $ baba URL"" again same as above. Still positive.

Twelfth and thirteenth tweets are duplicates with similar content: ""rt AT_USER what alibaba can learn from amazon and google's ipos URL $ baba"". Positive sentiment because they're suggesting learning from competitors.

Eventeen and sixteen tweets are about alibaba's IPO range, which is positive for the company's stock price growth. So that's another positive factor.

Seventeenth tweet: ""alibaba is looking like it's going to be the biggest ipo ever globally $ baba"". Positive, as it's expected performance. Also, this might attract investors seeking growth opportunities.

So compiling all these factors:

- Baidu has a good track record (positive)
- Investors may have high expectations from alibaba's IPO (positive)
- Alphabeta faces competition from other tech companies (negative)
- General market news and trends are positive (neutral)

The overall sentiment seems mixed, with some positive and some negative elements. The positive aspects of Baidu and the potential for alibaba's success may outweigh the competitive threat, leading to a positive overall impact on stock price."
2014-09-17,Negative,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company based on the given information. The user has provided 12 tweets related to $ baba stock. My task is to evaluate each tweet's factors, assess the sentiment, and then sum them up to decide if it's positive, neutral, or negative for $ baba.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. It seems like all the tweets mention $ baba or other exchanges, so I can assume the target stock is $ baba.

Next, for each tweet, I have to separate the factors into Positive and Negative. This means I'll look for words that indicate support (Positive) and opposition (Negative). Let me go through them one by one.

1. ""interesting take on alipay's valuation compared to tenpay . key is how well they will capture the market . URL $ baba"" – This seems positive because it's talking about valuations, which can influence investor sentiment towards stock prices.

2. ""$ baba well $ baba isn't $ king or $ twtr but both were "" big "" ipos and both rocked down , and $ king never come back up"" – The tweet is critical of the current situation with two successful companies (""big"" IPOs) but also mentions a competitor that hasn’t recovered. This seems negative because it provides contradictory information.

3. ""rt AT_USER how a group of investors secretly stand to reap huge profits in alibaba ipo : URL $ baba URL"" – This is positive as it highlights potential gains for investors, which can affect the stock price positively.

4. ""rt AT_USER 1/2 why alibaba is worth $ 100 / share : private co stakes worth billions $ baba ipo infographic URL URL"" – Positive again because it mentions a high valuation and potential for gains from private stakes.

5. ""rt AT_USER 1/2 why alibaba is worth $ 100 / share : private co stakes worth billions $ baba ipo infographic URL URL"" – Same as above, positive for the stock price.

6. ""rt AT_USER well AT_USER if there are any retail investors that actually get shares of $ baba in the alibabaipo , definitely let me kn …"" – This is neutral because it's not directly stating an opinion but expressing a thought or question which may not strongly influence the stock price yet.

7. ""my first trade in three months will be $ baba , haven't traded in 90 days"" – Positive as a new investment opportunity, which could drive up the stock price.

8. ""scon more updates , still slowly adding april calls .. later common to follow URL $ ge $ tsla $ tkai $ baba $ yhoo $ spy"" – This seems neutral because it's talking about future news but not directly related to the stock of $ baba.

9. ""amused by of the $ baba tweets . i only care what AT_USER says . well , and his shirt."" – Positive as a reaction, which can sometimes boost stock prices.

10. ""whoa ! rt AT_USER these $ baba headlines probably nothing right ? ? $ yhoo URL"" – This is negative because it's questioning the accuracy of the current information about $ baba and another company, suggesting the tweet may be misleading.

11. ""rt AT_USER these $ baba headlines probably nothing right ? ? $ yhoo URL"" – Same as above; neutral or negative for similar reasons.

12. ""$ gigm huge block buys ... $ baba - boom"" – This is positive because it's optimistic about potential growth, which can attract investors and boost the stock price.

Now, I need to assess each tweet's sentiment by considering all factors together. Let me go through each one:

- Tweets 1, 3, 4, 5: All have positive or neutral sentiments.
- Tweet 2: Negative because it provides contradictory information about $ baba and competitors.
- Tweets 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11: Neutral to negative. For example, tweet 10 is a reaction question but not directly about the stock. Tweets 7 and 11 are positive as new trades or opportunities come in. Tweets 8 and 9 have neutral reasons.
- Tweet 12: Positive due to optimism.

Now, I need to calculate overall sentiment. Most tweets are neutral or positive. The negative tweet (2) can swing the analysis slightly negative, but the positives outweigh it. So, the overall sentiment is likely ""Neutral"" because the net impact isn't overwhelmingly positive or negative."
2014-09-18,Positive,"Okay, so I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a given company based on the provided analysis. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at tweet 1: ""rt AT_USER i like obama more than ali ba ba . $ baba"". The stock symbol here is $ baba. From the other tweets, tweet 4 mentions buying $ baba and talking about market conditions, so $ baba seems to be the target stock.

Next, I'll break down each tweet into positive (P) and negative (N) factors. For each relevant tweet:

1. **Tweet 1**: ""rt AT_USER i like obama more than ali ba ba . $ baba"" – P: He likes Obama, N: Nothing else mentioned.
2. **Tweet 2**: ""rt AT_USER alibaba is different , AT_USER says . the allocation "" is as tight as a drum , and that's important . "" AT_USER $ baba"" – P: Alibaba's allocation is tight; N: No mention of anything else except the allocation number.
3. **Tweet 3**: Same as tweet 2, same content repeated.
4. **Tweet 4**: ""my 87 y / o grandmother asks if i'm buying $ baba yet . so yeah , it's that kind of market now i guess ."" – P: He is in the market; N: No other factors mentioned.
5. **Tweet 5**: ""AT_USER $ baba = smelly poop diaper"" – P: Negative emotional tone; N: None.
6. **Tweet 6**: ""rt AT_USER alibaba ipo by the numbers : URL $ baba URL"" – P: Alibaba's IPO being announced; N: No other factors mentioned.
7. **Tweet 7**: ""still time to get in the $ baba 1st print challenge , best guess wins a prize ! current tally median : $ 85 average : $ 80.8 URL"" – P: The event is happening; N: None.
8. **Tweet 8**: ""option millionaires : nlightn : $ baba , $ yhoo , ... alibaba to reportedly price within range ; yahoo lower URL"" – P: Multiple companies' IPOs are being mentioned; N: Nothing else.
9. **Tweet 9**: ""i'm hoping that $ baba doesn't overshoot tomorrow with all the buyers at open and then sellers throughout the day . not $ prqr $ fomx"" – P: The investor is cautious; N: None.
10. **Tweet 10**: "" esperando el precio con que alibaba $ baba empezará a cotizarse mañana en wall street"" – P: No mention of anything else; N: None.
11. **Tweet 11**: ""rt AT_USER huge show tonight how to play $ baba how to play experience economy fomo yolo lots of investment & trading ideas add golden t …"" – P: There's a positive tweet discussing investment strategies; N: No mention of other factors.
12. **Tweet 12**: ""rt AT_USER watch the $ baba ipo on URL and be 3-4 seconds ahead of everyone else . $ fb ipo our ticks were 900k vs . 932k 15 mins ago"" – P: The event is happening; N: None.
13. **Tweet 13**: ""the $ baba effect : traders exchanged about as many $ yhoo options today as they did s & p 500 options ( 931k vs . 932k 15 mins ago)"" – P: Market comparison; N: Nothing else.
14. **Tweet 14**: ""alibaba's ipo goes public on friday . here's what you need to know : URL $ baba"" – P: The event is happening; N: None.
15. **Tweet 15**: ""$ baba : what will happen when it opens tomorrow ? i'm optimistic it will open up and stay up throughout the day ."" – P: Positive statement about the stock's potential; N: Nothing else.
16. **Tweet 16**: ""alibaba's ipo price values company at $ 168 billion , giving it a larger market cap than amazon . URL"" – P: Mention of market value; N: None.
17. **Tweet 17**: "" cautionary view on $ baba from bloomberg : jack ma times market selling 2nd alibaba ipo"" – P: Negative commentary; N: Nothing else.
18. **Tweet 18**: ""AT_USER $ baba o rally by the who?"" – P: Positive statement about potential rally; N: No mention of other factors.

Now, I'll count the number of positive and negative tweets. From the above, it seems each tweet is either positive or neutral, except for a few which have slight negatives.

Looking at the overall sentiment, there's a mix of cautiousness (tweets 1-3,5,7,9,12,14) and optimism (tweets 10,13,16,17), but some tweets are more negative than positive. The presence of multiple mentions of $ baba in different contexts might imply uncertainty or confusion.

Considering the context and the mix of emotions, I think the stock is in a mixed state where there's both potential for growth (optimism) and caution (negative). Without a clear overall trend, it's challenging to assign a strict [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative] sentiment. However, leaning more towards optimism due to the positive tweets and the initial excitement of $ baba, I might lean towards Positive."
2014-09-19,Positive,"Alright, I need to process this query about the stock performance of Alipay (BABA) based on the provided news snippet. Let me start by reading through each section carefully.

The user has given a detailed outline of what happened during the Alipay IPO, including key points like initial public offer details, share price movements, investor reactions, technical challenges, and even some quotes from executives. My task is to analyze these events and determine whether the stock is positive, neutral, or negative.

First, looking at the information provided, I see that on day 10, Alipay's stock is trading at $92 per share. That's an increase from its initial price of around $80. This suggests that the shares are fetching premium value. Additionally, there are multiple updates related to the IPO itself, which could indicate investor sentiment.

I also notice quotes from key executives like Jack Ma, who mentions the potential for a 22% pop at the open, which sounds optimistic. There's also mention of Alipay being a ""black swan"" company and considering it as a ""bonus for investing,"" which might imply that the stock is viewed highly by investors.

However, I should consider technical factors like the lack of sellers before the IPO starts, which could indicate difficulty in trading quickly or potential issues with liquidity. Despite this, the overall market seems to be on an upward trend due to these positive signals from executives and the high price per share.

Considering all these points—the increasing stock price, optimism from executives, and positive messaging—it seems like the sentiment is positive. The increasing value of Alipay as seen through multiple updates aligns with a bullish outlook."
2014-09-20,Neutral,"Okay, I need to determine the overall impact of these tweets on the stock price of BABA. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Some are straightforward, like ""baba,"" and others include more information. Since the user wants me to focus on the likely impact, I think the most critical part is identifying ""baba"" in each tweet because it's a significant name I can look at.

Now, looking at each tweet:

1. Tweets 1-4: They mention BABA but don't provide sentiment or data related to stock performance. They talk about possibilities and investor reactions.
2. Tweets 5-8: These are repeating mentions of ""baba"" with various things said. Nothing stands out here.
3. Tweets 9-10: Again, the same repeated content. No action taken by investors.
4. Tweets 11-12: Both are about BABA's IPO and mention jack ma as a key player.
5. Taways from these tweets talk about profits (like ""100% profits""), which usually indicate positive news for investors.
6. Tweets 13, 19: They ask users to pick a number or win something, which is speculative and not directly related to stock performance.
7. Tweets 20-25: These are more about the government's role in $baba, but they don't mention anything about stock prices or BABA performing well.
8. Taways from tweets 26-34 discuss BABA's market cap, profits, and other metrics which suggest a positive trend because higher cap implies growth potential.
9. Tweets 35: They're selling shares of Danrocks, not BABA. Not related to stock price changes.

Most tweets focus on rumors or discussing the company's performance in ways that don't directly affect the stock price. The only clear positives are the repeated mention of profits and mentions of jack ma being involved with an IPO, which can be a good sign for investors. However, the speculative nature of many tweets (like picking numbers) makes it hard to gauge actual market sentiment.

Considering all this, the overall sentiment is positive because there's consistent positive information about BABA's performance. However, since some tweets are speculative or don't provide actionable data, it might not be a strong indicator."
2014-09-21,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of WMT. Let's start by looking at each tweet one by one.

The first tweet says, ""rt AT_USER $ wmt can't believe this ... AT_USER $ baba $ fb $ lnkd $ twtr AT_USER no wonder revenues are high ... romstocks URL."" I notice that it mentions revenue being high and refers to romstocks. I'm not sure what romstocks means in this context, but the main point is about revenue. If the tweet claims that WMT's revenues are high, it could be positive news because higher revenues usually mean stronger financial health and potentially better stock performance.

The second tweet is identical to the first one: ""rt AT_USER $ wmt can't believe this ... AT_USER $ baba $ fb $ lnkd $ twtr AT_USER no wonder revenues are high ... romstocks URL."" It reinforces the same idea, so another positive point here. The repetition suggests that the company's financial performance is improving or something positive is expected.

Now, looking at the third tweet: ""on friday , alibaba's market cap hit $ 231 billion . that's more than : facebook $ 200b amazon $ 150b ebay $ 65b URL $ baba ""."" Wait a minute, this seems confusing. It mentions Alibrand, which I think is a spelling mistake for ""Baba,"" and it talks about Alibrant Capital (BABA) having a market cap of $231 billion, which is more than the other three companies listed there. So if BABA has such a large market cap, that could indicate strong investor interest or support. A significant increase in a company's market cap typically suggests a positive trend as investors are more confident about the stock's value.

Putting it all together: The first two tweets talk about revenue being high and romstocks (which I assume is referring to their stock) doing well. The third tweet highlights that BABA has a large market cap, which shows investor confidence or support. However, without knowing the specific context of these tweets beyond what's mentioned here, it's hard to say if they directly influence WMT's future performance. But since two positive points are given about revenues and a strong cap for another company, I'm leaning towards a positive overall sentiment.

I should make sure not to get confused with other words like ""romstocks,"" which might refer to unrelated stocks or be a typo. The key is the revenue point from the first three tweets, which seems solid. So my conclusion would be that these tweets are likely positive for WMT's future stock price."
2014-09-22,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative for predicting the stock price of $ baba. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

Starting with tweet 1: ""$ baba down over 3.5 % in early trading."" That seems like a negative sentiment because it mentions a decrease. So that's a clear negative impact.

Tweet 2 talks about AT_USER trading levels for today on $ baba, mentioning the URL and stuff about YouTube. I'm not sure what this tweet is specifically pointing out. Maybe someone is watching a video but not sure about the impact on the stock? Not too clear yet.

Tweet 3: ""alibaba , facebook , and twitter : what you should own URL $ baba $ fb $ twtr $ bidu $ lnkd"" This seems like a suggestion to buy alibaba's stocks with platforms. It's more of a positive action than sentiment towards the stock itself, so not sure about the overall impact on the stock price.

Tweet 4: ""rt AT_USER AT_USER i made money by not trading $ baba."" Hmm, it looks like someone is making money by not trading alibaba's stock. This could be a short-term strategy or tip for investors. It might affect their confidence but not necessarily the overall sentiment of the stock price.

Tweet 5: ""bear case scenario why alibaba is over hyped . $ baba URL"" If the bear market is expected to be bad, it can affect investor sentiment. This tweet seems to outline a negative scenario, which could make people worry about $ baba's performance, leading to potential negative sentiment.

Tweet 6: ""rt AT_USER alibaba green-shoe option reportedly exercised , briging total ipo size to $25 billion - - URL $ baba"" This is talking about a specific event where the IPO was expected to grow significantly. It doesn't provide a positive or negative opinion but might influence market expectations for future performance.

Tweet 7: ""AT_USER what ? how the fuck is $ fb a $ baba comp , AT_USER the businesses are nothing alike . absolutely ridiculous statement ."" This is a critical and humorous critique of another tweet about alibaba's business. It makes investors question the company, which could lead to negative sentiment if it affects investor confidence.

Tweet 8: ""$ baba breaks $ 90"" Just stating an event that might impact future prices but doesn't express emotion or opinion on the stock itself.

Tweet 9: ""rt AT_USER the amount of money spent on the biggest ecommerce sites each second : $ baba $ 9,368 $ amzn $ 3,691 $ ebay $ 2,775 --> URL"" Talks about financial metrics but doesn't address the stock's performance.

Tweet 10: ""AT_USER AT_USER don't worry we still have $ baba"" This seems like a supportive message encouraging investors not to worry and having confidence in the stock. It's positive towards the stock price.

tweet 11: ""rt AT_USER alibaba : lève finalement un record de 25 mds $ bourse finance $ baba URL"" A quote from someone suggesting that alibaba reached a new high, implying strong performance which could be positive news for investors.

tweet 12: ""rt AT_USER alibaba now officially the biggest ipo ever , but it's trading below its offering price URL $ baba"" This is contrasting the current offering price with what people might expect. If the stock is trading below par, it could indicate poor fundamentals, which would be negative.

tweet 13: ""rt AT_USER catching up on alibaba ? AT_USER on the suddenly high expectations post ipo pop . URL $ baba"" Updating investor expectations after an IPO can affect their outlook. If expectations are increasing, maybe positive, but if they're decreasing, negative.

tweet 14: ""AT_USER jack ma and joe tsai added more to their wealth on friday than any of the world's 400 richest people as $ baba soars ht …"" A suggestion from someone about leveraging the success of another person. Not directly impacting the stock price.

tweet 15: ""$ baba allibaba fib re . 382 of the 68 to 99 range = 87.60 , fib 50 % re = 83.85"" This is a mathematical breakdown of a financial metric, not opinion or sentiment.

tweet 16: ""pressure on alibaba ’ s jack ma to deliver on roadshow rhetoric : URL $ baba money markets finance"" Discussing the presentation or messaging about a key event. It might affect investor confidence but isn't a direct statement of opinion.

tweet 17: ""rt AT_USER watch list 09/22 / 2014 URL $ bita $ gpro $ mbly $ baba and more ."" Suggesting to watch some platforms, which is a positive action from someone's perspective.

tweet 18: ""rt AT_USER alibaba to open on nyse friday under the symbol $ baba . URL ( getty )"" Another tip for investors about a specific event leading to stock opening on NYSE. It might influence expectations but not directly affect price.

tweet 19-20: ""get it, you don't have to be a quant."" A general statement encouraging investors in general, which is neutral towards any company.

tweet 21: ""AT_USER AT_USER don't worry we still have $ baba"" Similar to tweet 10 and 17, encouraging confidence without opinion on the stock price.

tweet 22: ""rt AT_USER alibaba to open on nyse friday under the symbol $ baba . URL ( getty )"" Reiterates a tip for investors.

tweet 23-24: ""get it, you don't have to be a quant."" Another general statement.

So, overall, tweets 1, 8, 9, 21, and 22 are positive because they provide information or tips about the stock. Tweets like 7, 6, 5, and 4 suggest negative scenarios but may not directly affect the stock price. Tweets 3 and 20 mention actions but don't express sentiment towards the stock itself."
2014-09-23,Negative,"Okay, let's see what I need to do here. The user has provided a set of tweets about BABA stock and asked me to determine their likely impact on the future stock price by analyzing each tweet.

First, I'll start by understanding the task. They want an overall sentiment for each tweet or maybe just one? But looking back, the output is supposed to be based on all the tweets provided, not per-segmented. Hmm, actually, in the user's example, they had five tweets and the output was ""[Neutral]"". So I think the approach should be to look at each tweet individually, assess their sentiment, and then combine them.

Let me go through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet says BABA closed the day down 4.26%, but it's an indication that another IPO is overhyped. So this could be negative because investors might fear more about the IPO than the stock price itself, which could cause a drop in sentiment.
   
2. Second tweet mentions Jack Ma being replaced and BABA dropping to $90. It seems like this is a negative signal that things are not going well for their company, so likely negative.

3. Third tweet talks about NYSE trading within a few cents while the other exchanges have $6 range. It also mentions hft liquidity, which might imply issues with liquidity, but not sure if it's positive or negative yet.

4. Fourth tweet is asking Yahoo or Facebook to acquire Yelp, which seems unrelated and speculative, so probably neutral because it's unclear what effect this will have on BABA.

5. Fifth tweet suggests acquiring YAHOO, FB, or YELP, again another speculation, so likely neutral.

6. The sixth tweet talks about PMI data bringing out bulls, aiming for a barometer for China. Positive information could be good for the stock, but not sure if it's enough to outweigh other factors.

7. Seventh tweet mentions that BABA wasn't hit at $65 and is looking for the real deal next. It seems like this might suggest they have an undervalued company, which could be positive as a signal for growth or valuation improvements.

8. Eighth tweet lists multiple stocks being traded on BABA, so no immediate action here, just about trading.

Now, I'll go through each point and assess the sentiment:

1. Negative (due to overhyped IPO)
2. Negative (bad signal)
3. Unclear but perhaps negative due to liquidity issues
4. Neutral (speculative info)
5. Neutral (speculative info)
6. Positive (PMI data could indicate future gains)
7. Positive (undervalued, which might suggest good growth potential)
8. No action

Adding up the sentiment: There are two negatives and three neutrals with a strong positive note from point 6. The overall sentiment seems to be leaning towards a mix of negative and slightly positive factors.

Considering that while some tweets contribute positive points like undervalued stocks or PMI data, others are speculative and not providing solid information, it's probably safer to consider the stock as Neutral because there isn't overwhelming evidence either way."

2014-09-29,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on BABA stock. I'm not an expert, but I'll go step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol. Looking at the tweets, tweet 1 mentions $459m stake in a Chinese hotel tech company, and that's BABA. So, the stock is BABA.

Next, I have to break down each tweet into its positive (Positive) or negative (Negative) factors and evaluate the sentiment. Then combine all these to decide if the overall impact is positive, neutral, or negative on BABA.

Let me go through each tweet:

1. Tweet 1: The user says $459m stake in a Chinese company. That seems like a significant acquisition. Acquisitions can boost stock price because it brings in more equity for existing shareholders. So this should be Positive.

2. Tweet 2: The user mentions options trading starting and the stock dropped by more than 2%. They also say it's below $90. I know that during option trading days, stocks often drop. So a significant drop from $105 to $88 is a strong negative impact. That should be Negative.

3. Tweet 3: The user states $baba is long and short relative to $86.5 and $93.9. A mix of long and short positions can lead to volatile prices, so this is probably Neutral because it's not clear if the stock is going up or down.

4. Tweet 4: The user talks about volume and says that implied volatility (IV) ranges from 28.7% to 38.2%. Implied volatility tends to go up during significant price moves, especially downward ones. So this could be Negative because higher IV might indicate a potential for more volatility.

5. Tweet 5: The user mentions options trading logged half the stock swings and mentions post-ipo days where it began trading. This seems like an indication of strong activity, which might suggest good news or bad? I'm not sure, but if they're seeing increases in stock movements, maybe it's a positive sign. So this could be Neutral to Positive.

6. Tweet 6: The user mentions shorting $baba and has tight stops below 88. Tight stops usually mean that the price is near a resistance level, which can indicate potential for decline once it crosses. So this should be Negative because being below resistance can cause selling pressure and lower prices.

7. Tweet 7: The user links to Bobirw, mentions covering $1000 worth at 88.82 and then later says he's waiting to cover more. This seems like a bit of fluff, but it might be part of his strategy. Not sure if this directly affects BABA stock; maybe Neutral since it's speculative.

8. Tweet 8: The user talks about short sellers being ""no rush"" to bet against Alibaba via AT_USER. Short selling can affect stock prices because it can create a lot of pressure on the price. If there are more short positions, prices might drop. So this is Negative.

Now, let's sum up each tweet:

- Tweet 1: Positive
- Tweet 2: Negative
- Tweet 3: Neutral
- Tweet 4: Neutral (IV increased)
- Tweet 5: Could be Neutral or Positive, but overall uncertain
- Tweet 6: Negative
- Tweet 7: Neutral
- Tweet 8: Negative

I'm a bit torn between some tweets like 1 and 2 being too specific. But I think the main issues are the drop in price (Tweet 2), volatility based on IV (Tweet 4, 5), tight stops (Tweet 6), and more short positions (Tweet 8). Twitter's sentiment is often a mix of positive and negative because users can write about various topics.

Considering all these factors, I think the overall impact isn't entirely clear but leans towards mixed. Maybe not too strong in either direction."
2014-09-30,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of $BABA. I'm not super familiar with all the terms used in the tweets, but I'll go step by step.

First, looking at each tweet one by one. The first tweet mentions that more clients are trading options for $GPRO compared to $BATABAI (which is BABA's symbol). It also says BATA was a top 19 traded option earlier and now it's down. That sounds positive because if the underlying stock moves in a way that affects options, sometimes it can influence investor sentiment. So, maybe this is a positive factor.

Next tweet is about being cash-rich right now. The user is worried about BABA plans. It mentions ""should be worried"" and points to some specific stocks like SHIB. This seems more negative because cash-rich might mean lower confidence or higher risk appetite. Investors are typically more cautious, so this could lead to a negative sentiment.

Third tweet talks about options on $BABA starting today. It includes links which I can't parse yet, but it's general. Starting options trading doesn't immediately show positive or negative, just a change in behavior. Maybe a neutral effect because not all companies start trading options right away.

Fourth tweet is about political woes hitting Hong Kong and Brazil stocks on Monday. That does sound like a significant event affecting the market, which would likely have a negative impact by lowering investor confidence.

Fifth tweet says that ""Ebay becomes an acquisition target for BABA in a spin-off announcement, thinking it'll improve my opinion."" This seems hopeful because BABA could be bought if they acquire eBay. Maybe this is a positive factor as it's speculation about a future move.

Sixth and seventh tweets are about specific purchases. The user is buying a 15% stake in a hotel software firm based in Beijing Shijie Information (SHIB). This sounds like a positive news because new stock acquisitions can increase investor interest, boosting the stock price.

Lastly, an analysis whether Alibaba would buy eBay. Again, if they do, it's speculative and could be a significant move, but it's still uncertain without more details.

Now, combining all these thoughts: The first tweet is mixed, the second is negative, third neutral, fourth negative (political issues), fifth positive ( Speculation about BABA acquisition), sixth and seventh are mixed. 

There seems to be a mix of positives and negatives. Some tweets suggest uncertainty or speculation, others indicate new information that could change expectations. Since there's both optimism and pessimism, it's hard to say for sure. Maybe the stock is in a neutral zone with some factors causing it to swing one way but not enough to tip it either way."
2014-10-01,Neutral,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for a company. The user provided four tweets, each analyzing something related to financial markets or investments.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. It seems like the main stock mentioned is TSLA because some of them mention it multiple times: $ tkmr , $ srpt / ebola drug hope , $ tsla puts , $ f recall & interview w AT_USER $ baba , $ wfm AT_USER reports $ $ URL, and then a list of other stocks like $ cybr $ loco $ gpro $ mbly $ aapl $ fb $ twtr $ nflx $ lnkd $ tsla.

So, the target stock is TSLA (T-SQL). Now, I need to analyze each tweet regarding this specific stock. Let's go through them one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions getting up every morning and shorting $Baba. That seems unrelated because BABA isn't a stock related to TSLA. So, probably no impact on TSLA here.

2. This tweet talks about $Tkmr and $Srpt, along with an interview with someone named AT_USER regarding ebola. It also mentions $TSLA puts. I'm not sure what these are referring to—maybe financial products or companies? Again, nothing directly related to TSLA's performance.

3. This tweet mentions political issues in Hong Kong and China-Brazil stocks on Monday, including some URLs with PBR, GOL, etc. These could be unrelated or perhaps referring to broader market events affecting sectors where TSLA is involved but not the stock itself.

4. The last tweet talks about a live recapping of the quarter and asks what's next for TSLA. This seems like it's providing information on the current performance of TSLA, maybe talking about upcoming news or upcoming earnings.

So, from these tweets, only the fourth one provides significant information about TSLA. It mentions the stock as part of a recapping session and asks what's next. That likely indicates investor interest in the stock's performance going forward. Investors might be waiting to see if they can buy it at a certain price level before it closes.

Since there's mention of upcoming earnings, this could signal positive sentiment because investors are more inclined to buy stocks when you're optimistic about their future performance. They might think the company is expected to have good growth or meet financial targets.

I don't see any positive indicators like analysts predicting strong earnings or any news that would boost TSLA's value. It seems more speculative compared to other tweets, which may indicate a bit of uncertainty but not a clear trend towards a change in stock price.

So, putting it together: the tweet is providing information about TSLA's future performance but without strong positive indicators leading me to believe there's an upward movement in its price. The sentiment seems neutral because while it gives some context, there's no clear push for positive or negative."
2014-10-02,Positive,"Okay, I need to figure out how to determine the likely impact on the stock price for the given company based on these tweets. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. 

1. ""there goes $ baba and its 40 bandits down the drain"" mentions BABA as the stock.
2. ""no digan que no se los dije : buta andan comprando $ baba arriba de 90"" also says BABA.
3. ""rt AT_USER the dow is down more than 500 points since the alibaba ipo -> URL $ djia $ baba URL"" mentions DJIA and BABA again.
4. ""AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER buy this dip $ acad , $ celg , $ baba , $ agio , $ regn , $ alzn , $ ibb . buy the dip . corp / ind bal shts never better ."" This includes BABA in the product name.

So, all tweets are about BABA. The stock symbol is BABA.

Next, I need to analyze each tweet for positive and negative factors. 

1. ""there goes $ baba and its 40 bandits down the drain"" sounds negative because it mentions a significant loss or problem with the company.
2. ""no digan que no se los dije : buta andan comprando $ baba arriba de 90"" is positive as it talks about buying on DJIA, which could be a sign of increasing demand.
3. ""rt AT_USER the dow is down more than 500 points since the alibaba ipo -> URL $ djia $ baba URL"" is neutral because it's just reporting market conditions but doesn't directly mention BABA or its performance.
4. ""AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER buy this dip $ acad , $ celg , $ baba , $ agio , $ regn , $ alzn , $ ibb . buy the dip . corp / ind bal shts never better ."" This is highly positive as it's encouraging buying of BABA stock.

Now, I'll assess each tweet to see if they are positive, negative, or neutral factors. 

- Tweet 1: Negative
- Tweet 2: Positive (based on buying DJIA)
- Tweet 3: Neutral (just market conditions)
- Tweet 4: Positive

Next, I need to consider how these tweets might influence investor sentiment and the stock price. Positive tweets like Tweet 4 encourage investors to buy BABA, which is a classic signal for positive news about the company.

Neutral tweets (2 and 3) provide context or support without direct information that would tip the balance either way.

So, putting it all together, the majority of the tweets are leaning towards a positive outlook. The positive tweet (4) is strong enough to suggest increased demand, which could drive the stock up.neutral tweets don't negate this sentiment but just provide extra context about market conditions.

Therefore, the overall sentiment is likely Positive."
2014-10-03,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user has given me some tweets and asked me to analyze their impact on a company's stock price using just ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"". 

First, I need to identify the target stock. Looking at the tweets, the first one is about ""bobirw"" with a URL mentioned. It talks about the stock price dropping from $89.60 and mentions it's out of the market for 17 later. The second tweet is about ""alibaba group holding ltd."" It says they have a ""$baba"" with a chart that goes up 1.22%, same as the market, and it's linked via a URL.

Since both tweets mention BABA (BABA stock), I think the target stock is likely ""BABA"". 

Next, I'll analyze each tweet separately to identify positive or negative factors. For the first tweet, Bobirw is mentioning that their stock has dropped 17 later, which suggests uncertainty or instability in their performance. That seems like a negative factor because it could affect investor confidence.

The second tweet talks about alibaba group holding BABA, which had an increase of 1.22%. Since the market might have been up, and they're saying their stock is same as the market, this could mean either a continuation of gains or maybe a pullback if there's some news impacting them. However, it doesn't explicitly mention anything bad, but the fact that BABA was trading higher than expected could be seen as a positive indicator for investors.

Now, considering both tweets together: one negative factor (Baba up) and another possibly neutral or mixed with an uncertain factor from Bobirw. I'm not sure about the second tweet's sentiment; it just states the trend is same as market, which might imply continuation but could also be cautiously optimistic if they're cautious.

For the overall sentiment summary: One negative point (17 later) and a positive note (same as market). It seems like there are mixed signals. While BABA had higher trading volume than expected, Baba's stock has gone lower. The other tweet is cautious but not entirely negative. So overall, it's a bit of a wash—neither too positive nor too negative.

I'll go with ""[Neutral]"" because there's some uncertainty and mixed information."
2014-10-04,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact on the stock price of BABA based on the provided tweets. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at the tweets, some mention ""baba"" and others include symbols like $aol, $baba, $googl, etc. The most prominent is ""baba,"" so that's likely the stock we're focusing on: BABA.

Next, I'll analyze each tweet separately to identify positive or negative factors and assess sentiment.

1. **First Tweet**: ""charts for ipo's since $ baba hmmm i see a pattern i think ! $ cybr the best URL"" – This one seems to be about something related to an IPO of BABA, suggesting uncertainty or anticipation in its future performance. The mention of charts and potential patterns could indicate investor confidence or expectations.

2. **Second Tweet**: ""yahoo nears investment in snapchat , sources say URL $ aol $ baba $ fb $ googl $ msft $ yhoo"" – This tweet mentions that Yahoo is investing in Snapchat, which might be a distraction or perhaps a marketing move to tap into the smartphone market. It doesn't directly relate to BABA's performance but could influence investor sentiment indirectly.

3. **Third Tweet**: ""$ baba - yahoo nears investment in snapchat , sources say URL"" – Similar to the second tweet, this is about Yahoo investing in Snapchat, adding to the mention of a tech sector that might affect overall market conditions and perhaps some stock performances.

4. **Fourth Tweet**: ""rt AT_USER one good losing trade $ baba | smb capital - trading education URL AT_USER $ study learn from thi …"" – This tweet seems to be about a trading strategy involving BABA. It mentions a losing trade but also encourages the user to study and learn, which is generally positive for investor sentiment. The mention of ""smb capital"" might refer to other investors or financial groups involved in BABA.

Now, synthesizing these thoughts, while the first tweet hints at potential future developments related to BABA's IPO, the subsequent tweets focus on Yahoo investments in popular companies, which could indicate a broader market environment shift towards technology and mobile services. Additionally, the fourth tweet discusses trading strategies, which might be seen as a positive sign for market confidence.

However, some tweets are speculative or unrelated, like the first one about an IPO, which can sometimes lead to uncertainty but is still considered part of the broader market analysis. The more concrete statements in the other tweets, especially the fourth one encouraging learning from a losing trade and promoting trading strategies, suggest that the broader sentiment is positive.

Considering all these factors—whether investors are concerned about BABA's future performance due to an IPO-related news or optimistic about broader market trends—it seems there isn't a clear-cut overall trend. There are mixed signals with some tweets pointing in one direction and others leaning more towards a favorable outlook.

In conclusion, despite the initial uncertainty from the first tweet, the subsequent tweets provide a supportive tone, especially the encouraging part about trading strategies which can enhance investor confidence. However, the presence of speculative or unrelated tweets adds to the overall sentiment."
2014-10-05,Negative,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on stock prices for [Baba]. Let me start by looking at each tweet one by one.

The first tweet says, ""breakingnews 'no one has any idea how disastrous it's going to be' warns california water expert ... URL rome $ baba."" Hmm, this seems like a warning about something serious. It mentions that no one knows what's going to happen and refers to a California water expert. I wonder if this is a concern about the company, maybe their environmental impact? If it's a positive message about awareness or caution, that could be neutral or slightly negative depending on how it affects investor expectations.

The second tweet is "" $ baba 52wk high click here : URL also see : $ dkgr $ cp $ baba $ dxj ~"" The text looks like some stock prices are listed. Since I don't have the exact context, but if it's showing a higher price over two weeks, that could indicate strength or maybe an unexpected gain. That might be a positive signal because higher stock prices can lead to more shares being bought, which is good for profits.

Now, considering both tweets together: The first one seems more about caution and possibly the company's situation. The second tweet has some stock prices going up, which could indicate strong market reactions or perhaps a sudden surge in interest. But without knowing the context of these hashtags (like [Baba], which is likely a tech or financial company), it's hard to tell if they're positive or negative. They might be both. Maybe the environment expert warning is positive, and the stock prices could be up for good reasons.

Putting this together, there are mixed signals. One tweet suggests caution about something affecting [Baba], which might be positive for investor sentiment by reducing panic. The other tweet shows increased stock activity, which could indicate a strong market reaction—either good or bad. Without more context on what the expert is warning about, it's hard to decide if that leads to positive or negative."
2014-10-06,Neutral,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, I need to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on a company's stock price. The user has provided a set of tweets and wants me to analyze them using three possible sentiments: Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

First, looking at the target stock symbol. Hmm, none of the tweets mention the specific stock, so I can't directly see which one it is. That means I have to consider that these tweets might be related to various companies without knowing the exact context. Wait, no, actually, each tweet seems to be about a different aspect or unrelated topics like dancing or floor safety issues. Hmm, this could complicate things because without knowing the target stock, how can I assess the impact?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The user might have provided tweets related to that specific company as part of their example set. But looking at the output format, they just need me to analyze each tweet and decide on the overall sentiment for the given stock symbol. So perhaps in this case, since there's no specific stock mentioned, I can't determine it accurately. However, maybe I'm supposed to assume that these tweets are about a particular company or aspect related to one.

Wait another thought: The user might have meant each tweet is about different stocks, but the output should be for the given stock symbol. But in this case, since no target stock is provided, I can't proceed further. That suggests maybe there was an error, and perhaps the tweets are related to a specific company that's not mentioned here.

Wait, no, looking again, all the tweets don't mention any stocks. So without knowing which company we're talking about, it's impossible to determine their stock price impact. Maybe I need to consider that each tweet is a separate point of view or analysis for a different stock? But then how do I combine them?

Alternatively, perhaps these tweets are all part of the same data set or context related to a specific company, and the user just hasn't provided it. In that case, without knowing which stock we're focusing on, it's impossible to give an accurate assessment.

Wait, maybe the user is asking me to analyze each tweet as an aspect regarding a single target stock, but since none of them mention it, perhaps they intended for each tweet to be about different stocks or unrelated factors. That seems conflicting with the output requirement, which asks for a conclusion on the given stock's impact.

I think there might be an error in the initial problem statement. Maybe the user intended for these tweets to be about a specific company, and I need to infer that somehow, but since none of them mention it, I can't proceed. Perhaps they provided an incomplete set or mixed up information.

In any case, without knowing which stock is being referred to, I can't evaluate its stock price impact based on the given tweets. Therefore, maybe the user needs clarification on whether all these tweets are related to the same company or different companies.

Alternatively, perhaps each tweet represents a separate data point regarding various stocks in the market, and I need to analyze them collectively. But again, without knowing which stock is being targeted, it's impossible to assess its potential impact.

Wait, looking back at the output example provided: The user included a line ""Conclusion with a single line that states the overall sentiment."" So they are expecting a single conclusion based on all tweets. Therefore, perhaps these tweets collectively indicate an upward trend or something else, leading to a positive outcome for the stock price.

But since each tweet is independent and doesn't mention any stocks, it's unclear how to evaluate their collective impact. Maybe each tweet refers to different factors or aspects of a single company? That would make sense if I'm supposed to consider them as part of the same analysis.

Assuming that these tweets are about various aspects affecting a specific stock, perhaps the user wants me to look for any positive or negative indicators in those tweets. For example, if they mention upcoming earnings reports, financial markets movements, or other market events, they could be signaling positive or negative news.

But without seeing the exact tweet contents and what each one is about, it's hard to assess definitively. Each tweet seems to be about different topics: ""breakingnews dancing without a floor,"" which might relate to something like stock buyback plans; ""url rome $ baba"" could be related to political events or other news.

Given that, maybe the user expects me to look for any positive or negative keywords in these tweets. However, each tweet is more about specific events rather than trends affecting a particular stock. It might not provide enough context to make an informed guess.

In conclusion, without knowing which target stock we're focusing on and having no information about the context of these tweets regarding that stock, it's impossible to determine their impact on its future stock price. I think there might be a mistake in how the problem was set up or perhaps missing some critical information."
2014-10-07,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of BABA. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First tweet: ""$ baba spectacular"". The words here are ""sp Clever,"" which is a positive sign for investors because ""clever"" often relates to innovation and profitability, which can boost a company's performance. That seems like a good sign.

Second tweet: ""how facebook & alibaba are turning the world's poor into entrepreneurs URL providing fishing rods & fish ? $ fb $ baba"". Hmm, this one mentions Facebook and Alibaba. Facebook is known for being innovative in tech and connecting people across borders. Alibaba has been doing great work in e-commerce and logistics. The mention of making ""rich"" entrepreneurs sounds positive because it could indicate that BABA is providing opportunities or solutions to those entrepreneurs. So that's another positive factor.

Third tweet: ""$ yhoo has its eye on snapchat – a move to repeat $ baba success ? URL stockoftheday"". This one talks about YHOO, which I know makes a lot of money in the stock market because it can buy and sell stocks quickly. The mention of repeating a previous success is also positive because it shows BABA's ability to capitalize on its past successes. Plus, snapchat being a trendy app could make the company seem more dynamic and capable of growth.

So putting it all together: Each tweet is contributing positively. The first one highlights innovation. The second talks about providing opportunities in tech. The third shows continued success by reusing their past gains. Therefore, the overall sentiment is positive."
2014-10-08,Neutral,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually.

First tweet: ""rt AT_USER the alibaba top -> URL $ spx $ baba URL"". Hmm, this seems like an exchange rate update. I know that currency fluctuations can affect stocks because they often impact currencies used in international transactions. If there's a change in the US dollar or another currency used by Alibaba, it might affect their portfolio, hence their stock price. But I'm not sure if this is positive or negative unless it's about a specific company.

Second tweet: ""rt AT_USER was $ baba the top ... lets talk blondes ... do you get a bonus whatever if you called the top ... dont think so ..."" This one seems more like an opinion piece. It talks about getting a bonus and whether others would think the same way when someone calls them the ""top."" This could be reflecting investor sentiment or a quote from a employee about performance, which might be neutral because it's not directly affecting the stock price.

Putting it together, the first tweet is about currency changes that could impact Alibaba's portfolio, so it's part of the factors. The second tweet is more about opinions and customer feedback, which doesn't seem to directly influence the stock. So overall, there are some positive factors (the first tweet) but not enough to outweigh negative ones from the second. I think this leads to a neutral sentiment."

2014-10-10,Missing,File not found
2014-10-11,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of BABA. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

The first tweet says, ""breaking news monetary policy and impact on assets : submitted by matthew corso monetary policy an ... URL rome $ baba"". It's a bit unclear about what it's saying, but I think it might be related to the effects of the upcoming monetary policy on BABA's assets. Maybe this is influencing investor sentiment.

The second tweet is from a user named ""nice article"", commenting that they agree with $BABA shareholders regarding their optionality and are prepared to respond. This seems positive because it expresses confidence in the stock, which generally contributes to positive sentiment.

Now, considering both tweets: The first one seems to be providing information or analysis about the monetary policy's impact on assets, which could affect BABA's performance. However, without more context like earnings reports or specific metrics, it might not significantly influence the stock price yet. The second tweet is a response that boosts investor confidence but isn't a major news item.

Putting them together, the first tweet adds value by discussing an upcoming topic, while the second provides support and reassures the market. So overall, these tweets are presenting information or confirming views without causing significant positive or negative emotions. It feels neutral because they're not directly predicting a big increase or decrease in stock price."
2014-10-12,Neutral,"Alright, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the given company. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually.

First, the tweet mentions ""Qatar's jihad,"" which is likely a typo and probably meant to say ""Qatar's Islam."" The guest post is from Brahma Chellaney via Stagecraft and Statecraft. While I don't have information on what Brahma Chellaney says, it could influence investor sentiment positively if it aligns with the company's goals or products.

However, without more context about the tweet's content beyond the typo, it's hard to say for sure. But since it's a guest post from someone, it might show interest in the company. The URL mentions ""baba,"" which I don't recognize, so I can't be certain if it's related to the stock.

Looking at other tweets, none are provided, but I should consider that each tweet could present different facts or opinions. Each tweet might influence sentiment differently depending on whether they're positive, neutral, or negative statements about the company.

Since all tweets need to be analyzed together and then combined, I'll have to evaluate each one's impact on the stock price based on factors like market reactions, company performance, industry trends, etc. Without specific details from other tweets, it's challenging to create a comprehensive overview.

I think I should focus on whether each tweet presents positive or negative information that could affect the stock. If several tweets are positive and don't contradict each other, they might lead to a positive overall sentiment. Conversely, if there are conflicting or negative statements, it could have mixed results.

Given that one of the tweets is uncertain due to the typo, I can only assume it might be neutral or positive based on its source. The other tweets aren't provided, so my analysis isn't complete yet. However, for this task, I'll consider each tweet's potential impact as if they were standalone and try to gauge their overall sentiment.

I realize that without all the information from every relevant tweet, it's challenging to determine a clear overall trend. It might be safer to say [Neutral] because there are multiple tweets that could either reinforce or contradict each other, leading to varied sentiment impacts."
2014-10-13,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price. The user has given me four tweets and told me to extract the stock symbol first. Looking at tweet 1: ""rt AT_USER the most interesting stocks in the world : $ twtr $ panw $ baba $ mbly"". Hmm, it's a Twitter account mentioning several stocks. But for analysis purposes, I think the actual stock symbols are important. Let me check the other tweets.

Tweet 2: ""$ baba new lows coming"" – this seems like a positive sign because ""new lows"" might indicate that BABA is improving or has some good news to come.
Tweet 3: ""$ baba oil $ aa financials $ usd eps thebigpicture"" – mentions earnings and financials. Positive again, as it looks like they're doing well financially.
Tweet 4: ""$ baba URL"" – not sure about this one. It could be a placeholder or typo. Maybe just the stock name without more context.
Tweet 5: ""$ qqq like i said 91.62 is coming . $ baba ruined it all but at least we played it perfect by selling everything when that garbage ipo came out"" – this looks negative because there's a lot of talking about the QQQ (which I think is another stock, possibly Apple or Tesla) and BABA being ruined in some way. There's also mention of an IPBO (initial public offering), which can be bad for investors.

Now, breaking down each tweet:

1. Twitter account mentioning several stocks – not sure about their impact yet.
2. ""new lows coming"" – positive outlook on BABA.
3. Financials and earnings – positive signs pointing to good company performance.
4. Just the stock name – maybe neutral or just info without sentiment.
5. Talk about a negative stock, BAA ruins it all – definitely negative.

Looking at these, tweet 1 is an accounts, so not actionable. Tweets 2, 3, and 5 have positive factors except for tweet 5 which has negative factors. Since there are both positive and negative tweets, but especially one with a clear negative impact (tweet 5), the overall sentiment seems mixed. However, since some tweets point towards good things happening, it leans more positive than neutral. So I think the overall sentiment is Positive."
2014-10-14,Neutral,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of BABA. Let me start by breaking down each tweet.

First, the user mentions ""ubs initiates $ baba as buy with pt $100 ; exposure to key secular themes of mobile , local and social + sustainable above-avg growth."" That sounds like a positive announcement because it's suggesting an investment in BABA and focusing on certain themes. Positive factors here would likely contribute to a positive stock sentiment.

Next, the tweet says ""$ baba 84.76 new low."" A new low usually indicates that the stock has dropped in value, which could mean the market is bearish. But I need to consider other factors like context and whether this is an isolated event or part of a larger trend.

Then, ""more all-time lows for $ baba , guess people are really taking those sell-side lovefests to heart."" This seems contradictory because it's predicting more lows but also suggesting that investors are being swayed by sell-side analysts. If the market is seeing more lows and there's increased buy pressure, this could be a mix of both good signs and potential negative influences.

Putting it all together, the positive tweet about exposure to themes might push the stock up, while the new low and the expectation from sell-side analysis suggest some bearish sentiment. However, since BABA is being exposed to trends that are favorable, the overall sentiment leans towards a small chance of positive impact but with some uncertainty.

So, after considering all these factors, I think the overall sentiment is neutral because there's both optimistic news and some uncertain market reactions."
2014-10-15,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out how these tweets impact the stock price for the company. Let me start by breaking down each tweet and seeing what they're saying.

The first tweet is about green stocks with various symbols like zips and twtr. It mentions something about a spike low in the dollar exchange rate. That could mean investors are concerned about inflation or something else affecting the dollar, which might cause a drop in their value. So that's probably a negative factor for this stock.

The second tweet talks about the ES (Ethereum) market being on a breaking news break with obola signs and symptoms linked to baba. Obola is a cryptocurrency, so if it's up, it might indicate confidence or positive sentiment around baba, which could be good for their stock price. But wait, it also mentionsmfers were buying or adding, which is a buy-sell signal suggesting uncertainty or possible negative emotions.

The third tweet is about lending clubs and alibaba financing. They're talking about BABA (I think that's the acronym). If people are interested in BABA for financing, especially Alibaba, which is a large company, this could be a positive sign for their stock. But it also links to baba, which I'm not sure about yet.

The fourth tweet is from a user who's expressing frustration about mentioning BABA as a reason why the top market goes down. It says markets don't go down because a company went p… and then continues. This seems like an emotional response towards BABA's mention, showing negative sentiment on that stock.

The fifth tweet just states that baba is up. That's positive, but it doesn't provide context yet, so maybe just a small part of the picture.

The sixth tweet mentions breaking news about obola signs and symptoms in Rome linked to baba. Again, similar to the second tweet, this could be positive if people are worried or excited about baba's health, which might influence their stock.

Putting it all together: The first tweet is negative, the fourth is definitely negative because of the frustration towards BABA. Then there are two positive tweets (2 and 6) suggesting some confidence in baba or related markets. But how do these impact the overall sentiment? Well, a mix of positives and negatives could result in an overall neutral or even slightly negative outlook.

Wait, let me count: tweet 1 is negative about green stocks, which are often in the tech sector, but not sure if they're positive or negative for BABA. Tweets 2 and 6 seem to be positive factors. The fourth tweet is definitely negative. So two negatives (tweets 1 and 4) and two positives (tweets 2 and 6). It's a mix, so maybe overall it's neutral because the positives don't outweigh the negatives."
2014-10-16,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company based on the given instructions.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking through the tweets, it seems like ""baba"" is mentioned multiple times, so I think the stock in question is ""BABA"".

Now, for each tweet, I'll separate them into positive and negative factors and assess the sentiment towards investor sentiment.

1. The first tweet mentions that more Chinese app developers are opening up, which could be a positive signal. It talks about the first day being up from the bottom. This seems like a strong positive factor.

2. The second tweet says $ baba is over $87.50 now. That's a buy-up, so definitely positive for BABA stock.

3. The third tweet mentions that $ baba is as high as it has been for the past 10 years with YHOO. While this shows a long-term perspective, it doesn't directly impact current sentiment about the stock price yet, more of a historical context.

4. The fourth tweet is about looking at the first day of option trading for BABA. Option trading could affect investor confidence but isn't directly a positive or negative factor on the stock itself.

5. The fifth tweet lists top stocks like ABLP, NFLX, etc., which are options to trade. Similar to point 4, this is more about trading strategies than affecting the stock's price.

6. The sixth tweet advises not overthinking after BABA's potential spin-off with PE or TB for EBola threat. This seems like a cautious and forward-looking statement that could influence investor expectations positively by suggesting they should stay calm before making decisions.

7. The seventh tweet mentions an increase in the ebola threat level by Obama, but it was 4 weeks ago and related to a reference from Rome with BABA. It's more about potential changes rather than immediate stock info.

8. The eighth tweet talks about shorting BABA at $88.30, expecting it to swing lower before new highs or lows. This is another trading strategy that doesn't directly impact the stock price but could affect investor sentiment by signaling interest in short-term moves.

Now, summarizing these thoughts: The first two tweets are positive with clear signals about performance and current valuations. The third tweet adds context about history, which might not be a strong driver of current sentiment. The rest are more about strategies or views without substantial information on the stock itself. 

Considering all this, the overall sentiment seems to lean towards positive because there are clear, immediate positive factors presented. However, since some tweets are speculative trading tips rather than market-moving news, they might not have a strong enough influence to significantly change the stock's price.

So, after evaluating each tweet and considering their impact on BABA's potential performance, I think the overall sentiment is positive but leaning slightly towards it."
2014-10-17,Positive,"Alright, I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets about BABA and determine their impact on the stock price. Let me start by breaking down each tweet.

The first tweet is ""$ baba ! ! !"" Hmm, that looks like some letters and exclamation points. Maybe it's a typo or part of a code? Not sure yet. The symbol ""baba"" might be an abbreviation for something, but without more context, I can't tell much else there. It seems pretty positive because of the exclamation marks, so I'll consider that as positive.

The second tweet is shorter: ""BABA!"" Again, it starts with ""BABA,"" which could relate to BABA stock. The exclamation point might indicate excitement or enthusiasm. So this also looks like a positive sign.

Looking at both tweets, they both start with something bolded and have exclamation points. Typically, exclamation marks in financial context can be signs of optimism or a call for action. Maybe the users are promoting BABA or acknowledging its performance. 

Now, combining these two tweets, both mention ""BABA"" and use positive indicators like exclamation points. This suggests that people are supportive of the stock or making positive comments about it. It doesn't seem like there's any negative language here, so the sentiment is likely positive.

I don't see any neutral or negative elements in either tweet. They're all positive. So overall, I should conclude with [Positive]."
2014-10-18,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol, which seems to be BABA (Baba Inc.). So, the company is likely named after the company itself or a notable figure, but since it's BABA, I'm not sure about that part yet. The tweets are:

1. ""auto trade stats updated URL $ baba $ twtr $ lnkd $ fb $ aapl $ nflx investors nasdaq ask for 2 weeks trial for autotrading""

I notice the word ""Baba"" is mentioned in multiple places, which might be important. It's likely that BABA is related to auto trading or something similar since that's what the last tweet mentions.

Now, I'll go through each tweet one by one. The user has provided three tweets:

1. First line: ""auto trade stats updated URL $ baba $ twtr $ lnkd $ fb $ aapl $ nflx investors nasdaq ask for 2 weeks trial for autotrading""

This seems like an update to some trading statistics and mentions other stocks, investor interest in BABA (maybe a stock related to auto trades), and it's asking about a 2-week trial period. The wording suggests that the user is looking for information or guidance.

The second tweet: ""baba $ twtr $ lnkd $ fb $ aapl $ nflx investors nasdaq ask for 2 weeks trial for autotrading""

This looks similar to the first one, just phrased differently with different stock symbols. The mention of the NASDAQ and asking about a 2-week trial also appears here.

The third tweet: ""lnkd $ fb $ aapl $ nflx investors nasdaq ask for 2 weeks trial for autotrading""

Again, similar structure, maybe from a different user's post or section.

Each tweet seems to be offering information about stocks related to auto trading, asking the investor for information, and mentioning NASDAQ. It's also requesting a trial period. 

From my knowledge, auto trading involves platforms like System beaten (STK), which might not necessarily be BABA. Alternatively, maybe it's referring to other platforms. But since the user is offering information in each tweet, it's showing they're engaging with investors.

I'm thinking that these tweets are promotional, encouraging others to learn more about a platform or product related to trading. This can help attract new investors by providing useful information. It doesn't seem negative or positive; it's just informative and asking for something else.

So overall, these tweets are promoting the value of the stock without necessarily reinforcing any sentiment. They might not have a clear impact on stock price but could be helpful in attracting more trading activity."

2014-10-20,Positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me take each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol is important because it tells me which company we're focusing on. Then, for each tweet, I have to separate the Positive and Negative factors. That means identifying what's good or bad in the tweet. 

The first tweet says ""bullish set-ups for monday URL other stocks to watch $ nlnk $ msft $ len $ phm $ adsk $ cuda $ tmus $ gpro $ goog $ f $ c $ bac $ baba."" It mentions bullish aspects and specific stock names, which are all companies. So this seems like a positive message about upcoming investments or sets to watch.

The second tweet is ""nln.to basic tech . analysis $ nln.to $ hnu.to $ x $ baba $ cop opinion , stock chart , low , recent headlines , hit my list URL."" It starts with ""nln.to"" and mentions several companies like hnu.to, which is a company name. The use of ""basic tech."" suggests they're analyzing trends in the tech sector. This could be positive or neutral depending on whether it affects investor confidence.

The third tweet: ""$ wb forming inside bar on daily chart , check out $ loco $ baba too URL."" It mentions forming a pattern and checking out BABA, which is likely an investment name. This seems like an indicator that something significant is happening in the tech or energy sector, so it's positive.

The fourth tweet is ""rt AT_USER $ baba seeing some mixed flow early , now sweep buyer 1488 baba fri 10/24 $ 92 calls ( wkly ) $ 0.45 ask."" It uses emojis and mentions a trading scenario where baba sees some mixed flows but the buyers are rising, suggesting potential moves in the stock price, which is positive.

Putting this all together, each tweet seems to be providing information about upcoming investments or analysis that could positively impact the company's future performance. There aren't any negative points mentioned, and most seem to highlight opportunities. So overall, I'd say it's a Positive sentiment."
2014-10-21,Negative,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on a company's stock price. The user provided a list of tweets and wants me to analyze their likely effect using just positive, neutral, or negative.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ baba battling w vwap since ipo , buyers wrestling control for first time since public URL."" It seems like the company is going through an IPO and there's a lot of attention. The fact that buyers are ""wrestling control"" suggests investor interest is high, which might be positive. But then it says ""wrestling,"" which could imply tension or maybe even some negative reaction.

The next tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ aapl $ fb $ twtr $ baba $ gpro $ nflx $ spy $ bac $ c $ mcd $ nke URL subscribe now for daily stock & option ..."". The word ""subscribe"" is used, which might indicate that someone is deciding to buy the stock. That could be seen as positive action from investors.

Another tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ aapl $ fb $ twtr $ baba $ gpro $ nflx $ spy $ bac $ c $ mcd $ nke URL subscribe now for daily stock & option ..."" Again, similar structure with a subscription link. This might show that more people are following the company's stock price, which could be positive.

Looking at some tweets about the IPO: ""rt AT_USER $ aapl $ fb $ twtr $ baba $ gpro $ nflx $ spy $ bac $ c $ mcd $ nke URL subscribe now for daily stock & option ..."" Maybe these indicate that people are interested in buying, which is positive. But then there's one about the IPO happening: ""rt AT_USER $ aapl $ fb $ twtr $ baba $ gpro $ nflx $ spy $ bac $ c $ mcd $ nke URL subscribe now for daily stock & option ..."" This could be misleading because it just repeats that the subscription is coming up, which might imply excitement or urgency.

Some tweets are more straightforward: ""rt AT_USER $ aapl $ fb $ twtr $ baba $ gpro $ nflx $ spy $ bac $ c $ mcd $ nke URL subscribe now for daily stock & option ..."" These definitely suggest that the company is at risk of declining, so negative sentiment here.

There's one about the IPO: ""rt AT_USER $ aapl $ fb $ twtr $ baba $ gpro $ nflx $ spy $ bac $ c $ mcd $ nke URL subscribe now for daily stock & option ..."" This might be trying to lead investors on or just repeating information, which could also be negative.

Looking at the overall picture: Some tweets show direct mentions of positive actions like subscriptions, others are more about risk and uncertainty from the IPO. There's a mix of positive and negative signals here. Positive tweets include subscriptions and mentions of the IPO as a cause for concern. Negative tweets mention the IPO happening but don't express strong concern.

I'm not sure if the overall sentiment is leaning one way or the other because there are conflicting signals. But maybe the positive ones, especially about subscriptions, suggest investor interest and potential buy pressure, which could push the stock up. The negative side has direct mentions of things going wrong with the IPO, but less focus on immediate risks.

I think it's safer to go with [Negative] because some tweets clearly state that there are risks with the IPO. But wait, I'm not entirely sure if that's the best call since others suggest positive sentiment from subscriptions."
2014-10-22,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze the given tweets to determine their likely impact on the stock price of a company. The options are [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Let's go through each tweet step by step.

First, I should identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at tweet 1, it says ""rt AT_USER truer words ! ! rt AT_USER AT_USER $ baba is a beast !"" So, the target stock seems to be BABA or BABY, which are trading symbols I recognize as stocks.

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. Let's look at tweet 1: ""rt AT_USER truer words ! ! rt AT_USER AT_USER $ baba is a beast !"" It mentions that BABA is a ""beast,"" which could imply high confidence in the stock's potential. So, this might be a Positive factor.

For the output requirement, I need to conclude with a single line stating the overall sentiment using [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

Let me process each tweet:

1. Tweet 1: ""rt AT_USER truer words ! ! rt AT_USER AT_USER $ baba is a beast !"" The phrase ""BABA is a beast"" could mean the stock is viewed positively, so this is positive.

2. Tweet 2: ""$ yhoo $ baba $ ba $ biib $ rgls $ bdbd $ brcm $ r $ dfs on the fly : closing wrap : full story URL"". It mentions ""closing,"" which might imply expectations of good performance or negative outcomes, so this could be a Negative factor.

3. Tweet 3: ""| $ baba $ ipo etf URL via URL"" Here, it's talking about an ""ipo,"" which is an increase in stock price due to new projects or company expansion. This would be Positive.

4. Tweet 4: ""$ baba ready to flush some speculators out in next 2 days it looks like"" It mentions selling off investors' money (flushing speculators), which usually indicates a negative outlook, so this is Negative.

Now, let's summarize the factors:

Positive factors from tweets 1 and 3: confidence in BABA performance.
Negative factors from tweets 2 and 4: expectations of poor or unfavorable closing performance.

There seems to be an imbalance between positive and negative factors. Positive has two tweets, while negative also has two. I don't have specific data on the strength of these trends or how much each tweet influences sentiment, but given the balance, it's possible that neither trend is strongly positive nor negative overall.

In such cases where there are conflicting signals without clear majority, sometimes it's neutral. However, if one side is stronger in magnitude than the other, the sentiment could lean towards Positive or Negative. Here, both sides have two tweets each, so it might result in a Neutral stance because neither side dominates."
2014-10-23,Missing,File not found
2014-10-24,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze the given tweets to determine their impact on the future stock price of a company. The possible responses are [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, looking at the target stock symbol, it seems like it's either Tesla (TSLA) since some tweets mention things related to Tesla. Let me check each tweet.

The first tweet is ""Trading mentorship and analysis only @ equity sense URL deals $ aapl $ tsla $ baba $ gpro $ eurusd $ es_f"". It mentions TA consulting, which suggests they're advising others on trading strategies. That's a positive sign because it indicates the company is providing value to clients.

The second tweet is "" trading mentorship and analysis only @ equity sense URL deals $ aapl $ tsla $ baba $ gpro $ eurusd $ es_f"". It starts with ""trading mentorship"", which again implies they're offering advice, which can boost investor sentiment positively. 

Both tweets are about providing trading insights or mentorship. They don't mention any negative keywords like warnings, negative news, or stock cuts. The language is positive and encouraging. So, combining both, the overall impact seems to be positive."
2014-10-25,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for the given company.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. The first tweet is: ""got to make sure the bill pay first , then i can work on some personal projects . few gigs left of october . beat $ aapl , $ baba , $ fb too :"". It seems like it's related to Apple Inc., so I'll focus on that.

Now, each tweet has two factors: Positive and Negative. Let me break them down:

1. ""Got to make sure the bill pay first"": This sounds proactive, maybe indicating that the investor is determined to succeed.
2. ""Then i can work on some personal projects"": This suggests the investor is willing to take action now for their own goals.
3. ""Few gigs left of october"": The word ""gig"" might be a placeholder; in a stock context, it could mean time constraints or project deadlines approaching.
4. ""Beat $ aapl , $ baba , $ fb too :"": This seems like comparing performance against Apple's three major competitors.

Next, I'll assess the sentiment for each factor:
- The first point is positive, indicating a clear intention to move forward.
- The second part reinforces that it's not just personal projects but also work, showing commitment.
- ""Few gigs left of october"" suggests that time is pressing, which might lead to increased urgency or focus.
- Comparing against competitors' performance can affect investor sentiment if they expect a certain level of growth.

Considering all this, the overall impact seems positive because the investors are proactively working on projects and facing pressure. It's not just personal work but also competition, which could drive positive movements in the stock price."
2014-10-26,Positive,"Okay, so I've got this question here about predicting stock market trends based on user comments and quotes from people. The user provided a list of 62 lines, each with a comment followed by ""poil"" which means something like 'if' or 'if you believe'. My task is to analyze these comments to figure out the overall sentiment—whether it's positive, neutral, or negative.

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. It seems like for each line, I have a comment followed by a specific action word. The goal is not to predict the stock price but rather determine whether the overall sentiment of these comments is positive, neutral, or negative. So, I should look through all 62 lines and see how many are positive, neutral, or negative.

Looking at each line, it's either 'poil' followed by a comment. For example, ""if you believe it will go higher"". These seem like recommendations or statements that someone might make about the future of a stock or market index. My job is to determine if these comments are generally positive, neutral, or negative.

I should start by categorizing each line as either positive, neutral, or negative. Maybe I can keep track in columns. Once all lines are categorized, I'll count how many fall into each category. Then, based on the counts, decide the overall sentiment.

Wait, but I don't have access to the actual data beyond what's provided here. The user has given 62 lines with comments and ""poil"", so I'm assuming that this is a list I can analyze. So, maybe it's part of an article or section where these are presented in order, and I need to follow through on that.

Alternatively, perhaps the 62 lines represent different days' comments, each with its own 'poil' statement about how people feel. In that case, I might want to analyze each day's sentiment separately before making a general conclusion.

I'm also thinking about whether these comments are all from one source or spread across multiple. If they're from the same source, perhaps there's a trend emerging in their language and tone which can hint at an overall sentiment. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.

So, my approach would be:

1. Read through each of the 62 lines.
2. For each line, extract the comment that comes after ""poil"".
3. Classify that comment as positive, neutral, or negative based on common sentiment indicators (like words like ""great"", ""good"", ""bad"", etc.).
4. Count how many are in each category.
5. Summarize these counts to decide the overall sentiment.

I should also consider if there's a trend over time—like does it lean towards positive as more comments come in, or negative, or neutral. But since I don't have that data beyond the 62 lines, maybe it's about summarizing just these lines regardless of order.

Wait, another thought: some of these ""poil"" statements might be about specific stocks or indices. Maybe they're looking for an overall trend in how people perceive the market. So, even if individual comments are negative, if many are overall expressed as such, it could influence the conclusion.

I'm also wondering if there's any hidden patterns in the comments themselves that can indicate a general mood without counting each one. But since I don't have access to those, probably not.

So, given all this, my plan is: go through each line, extract the comment, classify it, count, and then decide on the overall sentiment based on those counts. If most are positive, it's positive; if balanced, neutral; if more negative, negative."
2014-10-27,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about $ BABA stock and determine if the impact is positive, neutral, or negative on its future price.

First, I'll go through each tweet one by one. The target stock seems to be BABA because it's mentioned in multiple tweets. 

1. **tweet 1**: ""option millionaires : jimmybob : $ baba initiated with a buy at jefferies $ 118 pt URL"" – This sounds like Jimmy Bob is buying shares from Jefferies, and the price was $118pt. So, this could be positive because he's increasing his position.

2. **tweet 2**: ""rt AT_USER $ fb $ twtr $ baba “ AT_USER social media has overtaken porn as the no . 1 activity on the web . ”"" – This tweet is discussing social media trends. It seems like BABA might be seen as a positive indicator of social media's influence, which could be a neutral or positive signal.

3. **tweet 3**: ""que te parece $ baba ?"" – This seems like an open-ended question in Spanish, asking the user's opinion on BABA. Without specific information here, it's hard to assess the sentiment, but since it's not a clear statement of buy/sell, it might be considered neutral.

4. **tweet 4**: ""here's my video URL stock mkt analysis for wk ending 10/24 / 14 $ spy $ aapl $ ibb $ tlt $ qqq $ iwm $ baba $ xlf $ nflx $ ibm"" – This is about analyzing stocks, but it doesn't mention buying or selling BABA. So, this tweet isn't directly influencing the stock's price, so I can ignore it.

5. **tweet 5**: ""$ baba continues bullish rise on upgrade despite $ spy fall . $ qqq beginning to outperform $ spy , despite $ iwm $ dia $ ibb $ vix risk-off signal ."" – This suggests that BABA is going up due to a stock upgrade, even though spy is down and other factors like VIX are negative. So, this could be a positive factor for BABA's price.

6. **tweet 6**: ""$ baba back in $ baba ato . looking to hit $ 100 by eow ."" – This says the user is targeting hitting $100 in EWM (which might stand for something else, but given context, maybe it's BABA) and wants to exit. So, this seems like a short-term selling strategy, which is negative.

7. **tweet 7**: ""sold my $ baba shares last friday ... sold some naked puts"" – This is about selling shares with naked positions, so it's not buying or selling BABA; it's trading options. Hence, no impact on the stock price directly.

8. **tweet 8**: ""AT_USER i will enter into long $ baba if breaks above 98.30 with market price for an exit target at 99 . watching it"" – This is a buy signal: if BABA hits certain prices, they'll enter a long position and exit at another price. This indicates a positive expectation that the stock will rise.

Now, combining these thoughts: The tweets mention Jimmy Bob buying shares, possible social media influence, potential market movements (like spy and VIX), selling options, and a buy signal. Positive elements include buying shares, potential for BABA to go up due to upgrades or other factors, and a clear buy strategy. The negative part is the risk-off signal related to VIX, but overall, the positive signals outweigh the negatives."
2014-10-28,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out how to handle this query. Let me start by reading through what's given. The user provided a list of statements on Twitter about two companies: $baba and $aapl. They're asking for a conclusion with the sentiment tags [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative].

Hmm, first I should probably parse all these tweets to understand their overall tone and content. Looking at each tweet one by one:

- Tweets 1-4: These seem like regular updates about news or rumors, so they are positive because they're just sharing information.

- Tweets 5-6: Statements from $baba about new highs on shares. This also feels positive as it's talking about potential gains.

- Tweets 7-9: A quote from Jack Ma with a hint of positivity in the message. Positive sentiment here too.

- Tweets 10-24: Some more updates and possibly conflicting statements or questions. These might be a bit varied but mostly positive, except for some that could be negative if not careful.

- Tweets 25-34: More technical stuff, like shares reaching new highs and financial strategies. Positive trends, so no negatives here either.

- Tweets 35-40: Statements about piles of money into $baba, which sounds speculative but positive because they're investing or speculation.

- Tweets 41-42: Some tweets mention specific actions like pile all your money into $baba and then reactivate an account. This is a bit more intense, but still positive as it's a clear action.

- Tweets 43-48: These seem to be about partnerships with Apple and other tech companies. Positive because they're discussing potential investments or collaborations.

- Tweets 49-50: A tweet where the user reactsivate an account after Jack Ma mentions whitney in Bodyguard, which is a negative sentiment. But then at the end, it's all about $baba, so maybe this tweet has a mix of positive and negative.

- Tweets 51-53: More tweets related to CLTRader, but without clear emotions, they're more about reacting to news rather than expressing sentiment towards the companies.

Putting it all together, most tweets are either stating information or expressing speculative ideas. There's a few conflicting statements and an intense tweet at the end that combines speculative action with negative language. But since the majority of the tweets are positive in nature without extreme negatives, I think the overall sentiment should be considered mostly Positive except for some minor negatives."
2014-10-29,Positive,"Alright, so I need to analyze these tweets to figure out their impact on the stock price of BABA. Let's go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet says ""rt AT_USER $ baba : rbc capital mkts starts at outperform"". It seems like they're confirming that BABA is starting off positive, so this might be a positive signal for investors.

2. The second tweet mentions Apple and Alibaba tieup could transform electronic payments. This looks promising because it's related to tech companies which can boost the tech sector overall, especially if it's part of S&P 500.

3. The third tweet talks about $ bidu (which I think is $baba) being good eps but not enough guidance for investors. While earnings are a positive sign, it doesn't provide clear direction or value expectations, so maybe it's neutral here.

4. This tweet suggests that someone didn't upgrade BABA today and asks if anyone hasn't upgraded. It seems like an update query, which usually isn't very informative on its own but might indicate investor interest.

5. The fifth tweet says ""rt AT_USER will alibaba close above $100 today ? $ baba is finally on the rise . URL"". This looks positive because it's a direct statement about the stock price moving up towards $100, which can be a strong indicator of confidence and potential buying.

6. The sixth tweet mentions Raymond James initiating a ""outperform"" position for BABA. That sounds like an update to investors, especially if it aligns with expectations, which is positive for the stock.

7. The seventh tweet talks about $appl (which I think is Apple) partnering with $baba on their S&P 500 index. Strong partnerships in tech sectors usually boost overall growth and could be a positive signal.

8. The eighth tweet says ""$ baba bullish 14 out of 15"". That's an interesting number; 14 out of 15 indicates that most investors are positive, which is a good sign for momentum.

9. The ninth tweet mentions $millionaires using $baba stock as millionaires and highlights $deueba being bullish on Alibaba shares. This seems like a direct selling push, especially considering it's related to the tech sector, which often has strong growth.

10. The tenth tweet refers to $appl (Apple) partnering with $baba for their financials and mentioning $spy. $spy is an ETF tracking S&P 500, so this reinforces the overall bullish momentum across the tech sector.

Putting it all together, each positive factor—like good earnings, partnerships in tech, and direct price updates towards a significant number—is contributing to BABA's confidence. However, there are still some negative points like weak eps guidance from $baba but not enough for investors yet. But the overall trend seems strong with multiple signs of growth and potential buying.

I think the overall sentiment is positive because there are several positive indicators without being overwhelmed by negatives, which could have been significant enough to tip the scale. However, it's also slightly negative in a couple of tweets where $baba wasn't providing clear guidance."
2014-10-30,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for BABA. 

First, I'll go through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet is pretty vague with ""full analysis and how to trade..."" It seems like it's providing a lot of information but doesn't give any specific insights or predictions about BABA. So, I'm not sure what the sentiment is here—maybe neutral? Or could it be positive if they're talking about trading strategies?

2. The second tweet is similar to the first one. Again, it's an announcement with no clear implications on BABA's performance. It might still lean towards neutral.

3. The third tweet mentions Alibaba and their Hollywood dreams targeting Kुю. While that could be positive if someone believes Alibaba is a good investment or has strategic plans, I'm not sure if that affects BABA's stock directly. Maybe there's some buzz here, but it doesn't specify anything actionable related to BABA.

4. The fourth tweet asks why you won’t find Alibaba in many ETFs that track major indices. This seems like a technical question—maybe they're trying to highlight the lack of direct tracking opportunities for BABA. If this tweet is seen as a challenge or difficult, it might not impact the stock positively because ETFs are meant to track indices and offer value.

5. The fifth tweet talks about profitable stocks being recently upgraded with specific factors like $v$, $psec$, etc., and mentions companies like BABA. This seems like it could be a positive sign if investors expect BABA to perform well in the future, as it's making the case for its profitability. It might contribute positively to the stock price.

6. The sixth tweet discusses Alibaba enhancing their trademark card to protect leads from China’s e-commerce boom nears out, worth $8 billion. This seems like a strategic move to maintain or improve their brand position. If this affects BABA's operations or market perception indirectly through Alibaba, it might have some positive impact on the stock.

Now, let me summarize:

- The third tweet has some buzz but doesn't directly mention BABA.
- The fifth tweet suggests potential growth in profitability for BABA, which could be a positive factor.
- The sixth tweet is about Alibaba's strategy that could affect their market perception indirectly, though if it's seen as unrelated or negative, it might not have a strong impact.

Considering all these factors, the main positive tweet is the fifth one. It seems to suggest that BABA has potential for growth, which would likely contribute positively to the stock price."
2014-10-31,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of BABA. Let's break it down step by step.

First, identifying the target stock is straightforward—it's BABA. Now, looking at each tweet individually.

In tweet 1, AT_USER mentions that $baba is ""luring millennials"" and suggests buying chocolates while they cry. That seems like a positive statement about the company but not very specific or impactful. So, I think this has a slight positive impact on sentiment.

Tweet 2 says to buy both at $110 and $50. This sounds like an offer, which can indicate that the stock is becoming more attractive by offering different prices. That suggests growth potential because it's a multi-stage deal, so I'll mark this as Positive.

 Tweet 3 focuses on AT_USER highlighting that ABL (AT_USER) is ""luring millennials into the stock market."" This is another positive sign about the company's appeal to younger investors. It’s about attracting attention from a larger group, which can boost confidence and stock price. So, positive sentiment here as well.

Tweet 4 mentions verifying $115.68 profit for BABA. While this shows profitability, it's more of an update than a statement about future performance. It might indicate strength but not necessarily a change in market opinion yet. So, I'll consider this as Neutral because it's just providing information without predicting the stock price.

Tweet 5 is a bit more humorous. AT_USER is talking about selling $ CELG and keeping $ FB F. That seems like a funny move rather than an actual transaction or action. It could be seen as unrelated to the stock price, maybe even negative if it's considered unprofessional or irrelevant. So, I'll mark this as Negative.

Now, summarizing each tweet: 1 is positive, 2 and 3 are positive, 4 is neutral, and 5 is negative. Overall, there are more positives than negatives. The company seems promising with multiple positive statements. However, one tweet about humor might have some negative impact due to its unconventional nature. But since it's the majority being positive except for a couple of negative ones, I think the overall sentiment leans towards Positive."
2014-11-01,Neutral,"Alright, I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the given company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First tweet: It mentions another month being good for a part-time trader, but it doesn't specify what the sector is or any specific performance data. So this seems like a neutral piece of information since it's more about a trader and not directly impacting the stock price.

Second tweet talks about the user saying that AT_USER $ baba surpassed Walmart by market cap in intraday trade, hitting a high of $248.15 billion. While it mentions market capitalization, the actual value isn't provided. Without specific data or analysis, this is too vague to determine sentiment impact.

Third tweet is about a claytrader's video chart on baba stock. Again, it's talking about trading without mentioning any price changes or technical indicators that would affect stock performance.

Fourth tweet states that Alibaba Group will announce its September 2014 quarter results on November 4th. This is a major announcement related to the company, but it doesn't provide any information about the stock's performance yet. I can't assess how this might affect the price without more context or analysis of the report.

Since none of these tweets specifically mention positive news regarding the stock's performance, like an increase in volume, improved earnings, or a specific price target, they don't provide clear indicators of a positive impact on the stock price. They might influence investor sentiment, especially for speculative traders, but as a neutral piece without concrete data, I can't definitively label this tweet as positive, negative, or neutral.

Therefore, based on the given information and without any specific details about the stock's performance, the overall sentiment seems to be [Neutral]."
2014-11-02,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user has provided some tweets and asked for an analysis on their likely impact on a company's stock price. They want me to determine if each tweet is positive, neutral, or negative.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""apple x alibaba $ appl  s cook hints at the partnership $ baba url stocks trading."" Hmm, it mentions ""appl"" and ""baba,"" which are known symbols for Apple and BABA respectively. So the target stock is probably either Apple (AAPL) or BABA.

Next, I need to break down each tweet into positive and negative factors. For example, in the first tweet, there's a hint about a partnership between Apple and Alibaba. That sounds like a positive factor because partnerships can often lead to growth and expansion. Then, ""s cook"" is unclear; maybe it's a typo or something else unrelated. The rest of the tweet mentions BABA and stocks trading, which adds another stock to consider.

I should analyze each tweet step by step, considering factors like market reactions, company news, partnerships, etc. For this example, with only two tweets, I can evaluate each as a single factor.

Wait, actually, looking back at the initial response, it seems that both Apple and BABA are mentioned in the same tweet. So maybe they're part of the same context or related? That might mean we need to consider them together rather than separately.

So, for that first tweet, the positive factors could be the partnership with Alibaba (which is a company I'm familiar with, known for e-commerce and technology). The mention of BABA could indicate stock trading. Both of these could contribute positively to the stock price if they perform well.

But wait, ""s cook"" isn't clear. Maybe it's a typo or an inconsiderate word. It might not have much impact on the tweet sentiment.

Putting that together, I think the tweet is positive because it hints at potential growth through a partnership with Alibaba and mentions BABA stocks. So overall, this tweet suggests upward movement.

However, without more context about whether these factors are good or bad for the company, it's hard to say definitively. But considering the possibility of growth from partnerships, especially in tech, which is generally seen as positive, I think this tweet leans towards a positive impact."
2014-11-03,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of $Baba. I'm not super familiar with all the nuances of stock market analysis, but I'll do my best.

First, looking at the target stock symbol, it's $BABA. The tweets provided seem to be about price movements or investor reactions related to this stock. My task is to assess each tweet and combine the overall sentiment.

Starting with the first tweet: ""baba appears to be retracing , almost @ the 61.8 % fib line watch the vwap / supply formation URL."" This one mentions Fibonacci retracement levels and specific technical indicators. It seems like it's talking about the stock's potential movement after a certain level, which is common in chart analysis. I'm not sure if that alone indicates positive or negative sentiment, but given the mention of supply formation (which can be confusing), maybe neutral.

Next tweet: ""everyone wants $ baba down so they can buy . not going to happen."" This sounds like it's predicting a sell-off and is pretty definitive. The use of the word ""not going to happen"" suggests uncertainty or fear, which could indicate negative sentiment. But I'm not entirely sure; sometimes such statements can be seen as cautious.

Third tweet: ""patience awaiting alibaba’s results $ baba 👀 💰 💰 nasdaq nyse ecommerce china jackma sowingseeds new investor URL."" This seems to be a mix of optimism about future performance and caution. The mention of Alibrand and stock trends suggests that there's a bit of optimism, but the added uncertainty with futures and investing might lean towards negative.

Fourth tweet: ""[ smart money ] : $ baba 100.95 = that's why i sold and went : [ smart money ] URL."" This is from ""smart money,"" which typically sells stocks because they're concerned about missing analyst consensus. The user is selling their shares, so this directly relates to the stock price dropping. That seems like a clear negative impact.

Fifth tweet: ""60m $ baba upper trendline pressure 101.910 futures stocks 11:23 : 58 am URL signals base ... URL."" This is talking about future trends and pressures, which can be seen as speculative or cautionary. It's not directly about price movement but more about potential market conditions.

Sixth tweet: ""taking small pos in 97.5 $ baba puts 11/22"" - no specific context here. It seems to be a stock position taken, which could indicate selling pressure. However, the exact time frame (11/22) isn't clear, so it's hard to assess sentiment.

Seventh tweet: ""rt AT_USER the usd , $ baba's earnings call , and sunny solar stocks ( $ tan ); all here in the stocktwits weekly email > URL"" - mentions earnings calls and other stocks. It seems like there are multiple updates being shared, which can lead to increased trading activity but doesn't directly indicate a positive or negative trend.

Eighth tweet: ""rt AT_USER this chart puts alibaba's valuation in total perspective . URL $ baba $ fb $ wmt"" - again, mentions valuations and other stocks. It could be about how the stock is perceived by investors relative to others, but without more context on what they're seeing, it's speculative.

Ninth tweet: ""alibaba's first report in the am . zacks consensus = $ 0.37 . most ipos miss on the first qtr since analysts have no clue . $ baba"" - mentions that their own stock is underperforming compared to others and has lower earnings expectations. This could indicate uncertainty about future performance, but it's not a clear sell or buy.

Tenth tweet: ""this quote from alibaba's president shows how they plan to exceed walmart -> URL $ baba $ wmt"" - again, a prediction of future stock performance. The mention of exceeding Walmart suggests that the company is optimistic and looking for strong performance, which might lead to positive sentiment.

Now, summarizing each tweet:

1. Retracing potential: Neutral
2. Clear sell-off: Negative
3. Patience with uncertainty: Neutral
4. Selling shares due to analyst consensus: Negative
5. Speculative future trends: Neutral
6. Taking stock position: Could be Positive if selling pressure is high, but not clear.
7. Multiple updates: Could impact market sentiment positively.
8. Valuation perspective: Not directly related to price movement.
9. Uncertainty about future performance: Neutral or Positive?
10. predicting strong performance: Negative

I'm leaning towards overall negative because the first tweet mentions potential retracing and technical indicators, which can be seen as bearish if it's a correction. The fourth tweet is clear about selling based on analyst consensus, which is definitely negative. The fifth tweet talks about futures pressures, but without context, it's uncertain. The sixth tweet could indicate selling pressure, which might push the stock lower, and the tenth tweet's prediction of strong performance would drive it higher.

But wait, looking back at some tweets like number 4 and 10, they directly relate to price movements or predicting sell-offs. That seems more definitive than just speculative views. So maybe despite other factors, these are strong indicators of negative sentiment."
2014-11-04,Negative,"Okay, let me try to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of BABA. I'm not an expert in stock market analysis, but I can give it my best shot.

First, looking at each tweet one by one:

1. The first tweet mentions an AT_USER's perspective on Alibaba's valuation. It sounds like they're talking about valuations without giving any specific information or data. So probably positive because valuations are often seen as important for investors.

2. The second tweet says something about a miss in the rally and catch-up trades, but it doesn't mention anything about BABA itself. Maybe negative if there's uncertainty, but not sure.

3. Third tweet talks about retail sentiment being bullish on BABA without specifics. That could be positive as retail is often a strong indicator of future performance.

4. Fourth tweet mentions $ baba EPS missing the views from CRAMER. Hmm, EPS misses might suggest some issues or negative news, which would be negative for investors.

5. Fifth tweet gives an earnings preview of BABA, so this is positive because it's providing current information about the company.

6. Sixth tweet says that $ yHOO was ""pop in ah ... probably off $ baba sympathy."" It seems like a comparison without specifics. Maybe neutral if just general sentiment isn't clear.

7. Seventh tweet looks at their charts of the day, but again, no details on BABA. Could be positive or neutral as it's about their own stock performance.

8. Eighth tweet says they're tearing up after hours, which could imply a strong market reaction or positive news, so this might be positive.

9. Ninth tweet is similar to the first one; they mention valuations without specifics, so probably positive.

10. Tenth tweet talks about BABA being sold before E/R day with sheep on the guillotine. This seems like sell pressure, which could be negative as it's a downturn in stock price.

11. Eleventh tweet provides earnings data for several companies but not specifically for BABA. Since they mention $ baba, maybe positive as they're giving info about the stock.

Now, let me categorize each tweet:

1. Positive
2. Maybe Negative or Neutral
3. Positive
4. Negative (since EPS miss)
5. Positive
6. Neutral (general sentiment without details)
7. Positive (charts indicate performance)
8. Positive (trader's reaction)
9. Positive
10. Negative (sell pressure)
11. Positive

So, combining these: several tweets are positive about BABA, but some are negative because of EPS misses and sell pressure from the 10th tweet. The overall sentiment seems leaning towards a mix of positive and negative factors. Since there's both strong information (like earnings) and some negative indicators, it might be neutral."
2014-11-05,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out the overall impact of these tweets on BABA's stock price. I'm not an expert in stock trading, but I'll give it my best shot.

First, looking at tweet 1: It says ""rt AT_USER Alibaba margins narrow , but mobile revenue explodes URL $ baba $ jd $ tcehy."" So, Alibaba is having some tough margins, but their mobile business seems doing well. That could be positive because good margins mean they have more profit to invest into growth areas like mobile.

Next, tweet 2 mentions that $ gpro is entering China through Alibaba and via link : URL .. … I think it's about BABA entering the Chinese market, which can definitely boost their stock price as they gain a new customer base.

Tweet 3 is just a number: ""clayton : $ baba 109.37 URL"" – not sure what Clayton refers to here. It could be some stock exchange data, but without context, it's hard to tell if that's positive or negative. Maybe neutral because we don't know the reason behind this number.

Tweet 4 talks about BABA receiving $1 billion in debt for a deal with a Chinese tech company. This sounds like they might need more capital, which could be both positive (if they're expanding) and possibly neutral if it's seen as a short-term financial adjustment rather than necessarily bad news.

Tweets 5, 6, and 7 all mention 3D printing organs approaching their delivery. That seems unrelated to BABA, but maybe the user is testing how people handle unexpected events or trends. They might be focusing on the market reaction during such sudden news, which could cause some price movement but likely isn't directly correlated with BABA's stock.

Tweets 8 and 9 are about $baba alerts from different companies. While interesting to see multiple names triggering alerts, without knowing what those companies are or their recent performance, it's hard to assess if they're positive or negative factors for BABA. It could have some effect but isn't clear-cut.

Considering all these tweets: the company is doing well in mobile revenue and expanding into China ( tweet 2), has some debt obligations that might require more capital (tweet 4). The other tweets are unrelated, so they don't seem to directly impact BABA's stock. 

So overall, the positive factors like mobile expansion and potential future growth seem dominant, while the negative factors like debt or unexpected news are less clear but don't outweigh the positives. Therefore, I'd lean towards a Positive overall sentiment."
2014-11-06,Positive,"Alright, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of BABA. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet talks about deals with several companies and mentions a new URL.
2. It doesn't seem positive or negative immediately; more analysis needed.
3. The second tweet starts with "" anyone short $ baba ?"" which might indicate uncertainty, but not sure if it's positive or negative.
4. The third tweet discusses deals again, so that reinforces the earlier sentiment about potential deals.
5. The fourth tweet mentions BABA surpassed a 61.8% move and links it to its valuation.
6. The fifth tweet praises BABA as galloping towards $120, which is interesting for investors looking to buy at a lower price point.
7. The sixth tweet says ""gallop toward that $120 level"" implying potential gains, so positive sentiment.
8. The seventh tweet talks about $ spy and other stocks, but doesn't mention BABA, so probably neutral or negative? Maybe not relevant here.
9. The eighth tweet mentions market cap near 280 billion for BABA and FB at 209 billion, which could suggest strong growth, but the actual content is about alerts, not related to stock price changes.
10. The tenth tweet summarizes a stock recap, doesn't seem positive or negative on its own.
11. The eleventh tweet talks about $ odp and mentions Senate awards, perhaps unrelated.
12. The twelfth tweet notes market cap numbers but no action taken, so not influencing the stock price.
13. The thirteenth tweet is related to TSLA (which could be SPY) and shows sell orders from crossfinder, implying potential sell pressure but doesn't directly talk about BABA.
14. The fourteenth tweet visualizes BABA's size with an image URL, which might not directly affect the price.
15. The fifteenth tweet says $baba and $aapl are at the same price now, suggesting a possible dip or adjustment in their relationship but doesn't impact stock price directly.
16. The sixteenth tweet talks about GRO and SIRI, unrelated to BABA.
17. The seventeenth tweet mentions TSLA breaking a level for sigma-x, crossfinder, etc., which could mean some market movement affecting prices indirectly.
18. The eighteenth tweet is about a bot with $baba at 109.35, but no mention of stock price changes or actions.
19. The nineteenth tweet mentions the IPo index up and BABA's potential for growth, possibly influencing sentiment positively.
20. The twentieth tweet talks about BABA's future direction based on price trends, which is speculative but could suggest investor interest.

Putting it all together: Positive tweets mention deals, market cap numbers, and predictions of stock moves towards $120 or higher. Neutral tweets discuss general market movements or unrelated topics. Negative would include things like negative sentiment from users, but none here seem to indicate negative emotions. So overall, the positive impact is strong."
2014-11-07,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on BABA stock's future price. Let me start by understanding each tweet individually.

First, there are 11 tweets. I'll go through them one by one and note down their key points and sentiment.

1. The first tweet says ""$ baba $ 114.56"" – that seems like a price target or an offer. It could be positive if they're making a bet on the stock, but it's just a number without context.
2. Second tweet talks about Alibaba beating Apple in the stock market after a split. That's a significant event and usually favorable for BABA since it might boost its earnings. The fact that the split is a common practice and could benefit the company makes this positive.
3. Third tweet asks if upcoming companies like Citi, boa, andGS would pump their stock. I'm not sure what they mean by ""pump in."" Maybe some stock options or shares. If investors expect more buying, it might be positive.
4. Fourth tweet from a user mentions ""regis philbin names his favorite stock picks"" and gives prices for BABA, AAPL, MU, TSLA, etc. This seems like a recommendation, which is good news because it's providing value to the user, which could boost their stock price.
5. Fifth tweet says $ baba has gone up by 17% from its previous high. That's a clear upward movement, so positive sentiment.
6. Sixth tweet talks about trading 1k shares at $91 and warns that they won't be sold unless subscribed to an newsletter. Subscribing to newsletters is a common practice for regular updates, which can indicate investor interest or confidence in the stock. This could make sentiment positive.
7. Seventh tweet mentions going near highs on decent volume. High volume usually suggests strong trading, which can indicate optimism about the market or company performance, making it positive.
8. Eighth tweet says BABA is making up for a lot of frustration and gets ""beast."" That's a bit ambiguous but could imply that despite his actions, there's still some underlying positive intent or intention to build excitement around the stock. This would likely contribute positively.
9. Ninth tweet from a user mentions AlphaBit Mimosas for their job. It seems like a personal touch or a way to boost morale rather than just talking about the stock. That might be seen as a positive, especially if it's in a supportive context.
10. Tenth tweet offers daily newsletters with high-risk/reward ratios. High risk can sometimes lead to negative sentiment if there are risks involved, but since it's encouraging users to take action, it could still have a positive impact on user behavior and, by extension, stock price.
11. Twelfth tweet says $ aapl is the first scare in its money, so the stock will rise to $aapl. If they're seeing this as a positive outcome, it would boost BABA's price.

Now, combining all these points: The tweets suggest that BABA could go up, there are good news mentions like Alibaba doing well and users encouraging them to trade or subscribe. There's also some frustration addressed with ""beast,"" which might make it seem more approachable. The volume is high, and the user is taking action-oriented advice. So overall, these tweets indicate a positive outlook for BABA, likely causing a positive sentiment."
2014-11-08,Negative,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. The user has given me two tweets and asked to analyze their likely effect on the stock's future price. The possible responses are ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"". 

First, let's look at each tweet individually. 

The first tweet is ""stock market video : 11-8- 14 URL $ spy $ qqq $ aapl $ baba $ len $ act $ jazz"". It mentions multiple stocks: SPY (Spy), QQQ (QQQ), APL, BABA, LEN, ACT, and JAZZ. These are all stock ticker symbols. The word ""stock market video"" suggests that someone is watching the stock market live or has a video feed. The use of dollar signs usually indicates that these are stocks being traded on a platform like Yahoo Finance or something similar. So, this tweet is providing information about several companies that might affect their stock prices.

Now, considering the sentiment, I'd say it's pretty neutral. These tweets aren't explicitly positive or negative; they're just informing investors about the current market state and specific stocks. The fact that there are multiple symbols means it's giving a snapshot of the current day's trading activity without adding any opinions or recommendations.

Moving on to the second tweet: ""momo scanner output : highlights big options trades with < 14 dte $ baba $ apl $ yhoo $ nflx"". This one is about something related to stock trades. The word ""options"" here makes me think of trading strategies, but it's not explicitly positive or negative. Instead, it mentions specific stocks: DB (DTE), ABT (BABA), AY (APL), and NFLX (NHLM). Similar to the first tweet, this is informing about current stock information without expressing a particular outlook.

Again, for sentiment analysis, this is neutral as well. The mention of options trades might indicate that some investors are watching or reacting to market movements but doesn't convey strong positive or negative information.

Since both tweets provide info on stock symbols and don't offer any recommendations or opinions about the companies, they're more about current trends and market state than future predictions. Therefore, their impact is neutral because neither of these tweets directly suggest a direction for the stock price."

2014-11-14,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of baba. Let me start by breaking down each tweet.

First tweet says ""rt AT_USER how alibaba turned 1111 into $ $ $ URL $ baba URL"". Hmm, seems like it's making a joke about Alibaba turning some number into $ and mentioning baba. It's a bit unclear, but I think it might be implying something about the company or a specific stock.

Second tweet is ""$ baba customers first , employees second and investors third . URL"". This seems to suggest that baba has priority over employees and customers in terms of investor attention. That sounds positive because it could mean more attention from different stakeholders, which usually indicates good news.

Third tweet just says ""weekend review 11/7 / 14 : $ baba $ aapl $ ma $ v $ meli $ data $ alxn $ crm $ bidu $ ilmn $ tsm $ rfmd $ ulta $ ffiv $ flt $ loco $ ttm URL"". It mentions several stocks and dates, which are pretty random. There's no specific information about baba here, so I'm not sure if this tweet is relevant.

Fourth tweet is ""$ baba 2013 singles day vs . black friday & cyber monday gross market value in sales | via AT_USER AT_USER URL"". This seems to compare the gross market value on specific days—singles day, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday. While it's comparing different events during a week, it doesn't mention baba specifically or provide any information about its stock performance.

So combining all these tweets: The first tweet might be a joke without clear impact, the second one suggests good investor sentiment, but the others don't directly relate to baba's news. I think the positive analysis is leaning towards the market being more supportive because of customer and employee priority, which can boost confidence."

2014-11-24,Positive,"Okay, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. The user provided eight tweets and asked for an analysis using [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, let's parse each tweet.

1. ""profitable stocks : recently upgraded : $ per $ akr $ hcp $ ambc $ phm $ sdr $ slw $ baba $ clny $ ntes $ wetf $ chkp $ royt $ v $ epr URL"" – This seems like an email or message from the stock, indicating they're planning to invest in BABA. Positive because it's about investing.

2. ""rt AT_USER russia's richest man on investing in al Alibaba , xiaomi $ baba URL via AT_USER"" – It mentions that a rich man is investing in Alibaba and Xaoi, which could lead investors to buy shares of BABA if the tech sector improves. Positive because it affects investor sentiment.

3. ""AT_USER baba v fb are the 3 biggest u . s . ipos ever . they also have huge profit margins . coincidence ? URL $ baba $ fb"" – Here, they're talking about big tech stocks and their profits. This could indicate good news for BABA's profitability, which is positive.

4. ""rt $ tsla algos broke 245 level in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx p / t 240 $ baba $ bidu $ pcln $ goog $ fb $ amzn $ gpro $ nflx $ aapl $ qqq hft"" – This tweet is about Tesla's stock price breaking key levels, which can be seen as positive news if it suggests a potential upward trend. BABA might react positively.

5. ""$ 114 opens door for $ 140 $ baba"" – The opening price of BABA could indicate that investors are buying at a lower price than the current market, suggesting good buys or positive expectations.

6. ""rt AT_USER $ baba $ ebay $ gs etc .. ultimate stock-pickers : 10 high-conviction and new-money purchases ➜ URL URL"" – It's about someone picking stocks for high conviction, which is usually seen as positive because it can drive up the price of BABA.

7. ""AT_USER i'm watching too , rejected it hard on friday , since then $ baba been barely on par with the market ."" – This seems like a negative remark from BABA's manager or team. It could indicate some criticism, which might be bad news if people are seeing reductions in their shares.

8. ""sold more naked puts on $ baba"" – Selling naked puts could reduce the supply of BABA stock, potentially increasing its price. So this is positive because it affects investor sentiment negatively but may lead to higher prices.

Now, summarizing:

- Tweets 1, 2, 3, 4 suggest positive outlook from different angles.
- Tweet 7 is negative.
- Tweets 5 and 6 are also positive because they indicate good news for BABA.
- Tweet 8 could be either positive or negative based on the effect of selling naked puts.

Overall sentiment seems positive due to multiple supportive tweets. However, one negative tweet might influence this."
2014-11-25,Negative,"Alright, let's tackle this analysis step by step. I need to determine the likely impact of these tweets on Tesla stock (TSLA). The goal is to assess whether each tweet contributes positively, neutrally, or negatively to the stock price.

First, looking at the target stock symbol. From the tweets, it seems like the stock in question is TSLA because of the mention of ""algs."" I'll assume that's correct unless there's evidence otherwise.

Now, I need to analyze each tweet individually and then combine them for an overall sentiment.

1. **First Tweet**: Says TSLA has a $240 sell order on several platforms at 9:50 AM ET. This seems like it could affect investor sentiment as sell orders might indicate concern about future price changes, potentially lowering demand. So this is likely positive but maybe a bit of both.

2. **Second Tweet**: Same time, same stock. Another sell order, reinforcing the previous sentiment that TSLA's price might drop. Still leaning towards positive but also possible neutral if other factors are at play.

3. **Third Tweet**: Again, a sell order at 15:50 ET. This is another instance of investor concern about future prices. It seems consistent with a negative trend in stock sentiment.

4. **Fourth Tweet**: Here, the user mentions that analysts have opinions on undervalued stocks and lists some companies. While this could imply lower valuations and perhaps better growth prospects, it doesn't directly talk about TSLA's price movement. So maybe neutral or slightly positive depending on whether investors see a buy signal.

5. **Fifth Tweet**: Talks about $baba having lost 50% of its value after trading at $2.60, rebought to $2.85, and sold up to $3.30, resulting in a -50 loss. This is a clear sell-off event for baba, which could be a significant negative impact on the overall market. However, if it's related to TSLA, the sentiment might have other implications.

6. **Sixth Tweet**: Discusses TSLA breaking above the 248 level in sigma-x, etc., and mentions the broker loving these stocks. This suggests that TSLA is a strong performer, possibly contributing positively to investor confidence.

7. **Seventh Tweet**: Reiterates the same point as tweet 6 regarding TBLA's performance. It reinforces the idea that TBLA is performing well.

8. **Eighth Tweet**: Same as tweets 6 and 7; another mention of TBLA's good performance.

9. **Ninth Tweet**: Similar to tweet 6, again about TBLA's rise from $113.83 to $240 per share. This is a sell-off event that could have significant negative effects on the stock price.

10. **Tenth Tweet**: A block trade of $750,000 shares at $113.83. Block trades are typically bad news because they indicate panic selling, which can decrease the stock's value quickly. This would likely be a negative impact.

11. **Eleventh Tweet**: Talks about a +$1 gap in $baba compared to the previous day. A positive news item could be seen as good for investors but may not directly relate to TBLA unless there are cross-correlations, which aren't evident here.

12. **Twelfth Tweet**: Similar to tweet 11; mentions a +$1 gap in $baba. Again, this is about baba's performance rather than TBLA.

13-15: All tweets mention analysts giving opinions on undervalued stocks and specifically listing various companies. This could indicate lower valuations and better growth prospects for these stocks, which might be positive news for investors, possibly impacting TBLA's stock price positively if there are correlations or mentions of cross-correlation.

Now, compiling the sentiment from each tweet:

- Tweets 1,2,3: Positive due to sell orders.
- Tweet 4: Neutral as it provides info without mentioning price changes.
- Tweets 5 and onwards: Mixed. Tweets 6,7,8,9,10 are negative because of the price drops and block trades. But tweet 11 is neutral as it's about market performance but not TBLA directly. Tweets 12-15 could be positive if TBLA is a part of these discussions.

So overall sentiment seems mixed. There are consistent sell orders, which could hint at negative trends in other sectors or related products like baba. However, the block trades and some analyst opinions suggest potential positive signals. The combination leads to an overall neutral stance because there's both strong and weak factors affecting the stock."
2014-11-26,Positive,"Alright, I need to determine the likely impact of these tweets on the stock price of a given company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. **First three tweets** all mention that AT_USER undervalued their stock news from analysts and then provide specific stocks like ntek, ctix, aapl, etc. These seem to be positive because they're indicating the stock is being evaluated and underperformed.

2. The fourth tweet repeats the same positive statement about undervaluation but uses different stock names instead of AT_USER. This repetition suggests consistent positivity.

3. The fifth tweet talks about $ tsla triggering a buy for several platforms like sigma-x, ats, lx, etc., at 09:55. While this could indicate investor sentiment towards the stock, it's less direct compared to the previous ones. It might show some interest but not as strong as the others.

4. The sixth tweet suggests that $ baba will cause global expansion in Amazon and eBay further back with their push, mentioning other companies like gpro and nflx. This seems a bit vague and speculative, possibly more about future plans than immediate stock performance.

5. The seventh tweet is from Facebook and mentions that if $ baba goes lower, profits would be amazing. This could mean that the company's profitability is expected to rise if it continues its expansion. However, without concrete data or positive statements, it's hard to gauge a strong impact yet.

6. The eighth tweet again repeats the same undervalued stock news but with different stocks like mcig instead of AT_USER. It shows consistent indicators across multiple stocks, which might support overall positive sentiment towards the company.

Considering all these factors, the main points are consistently positive statements about undervaluation and potential future expansion. While some tweets hint at future developments or potential increases in profits (like tweet 7), they're not as strong or direct as the more specific stock mentions. The repetition of positive language across multiple tweets seems to indicate that investors expect the stock to perform well, although without concrete data on price changes or other indicators like trading volume, it's challenging to make a confident judgment.

I'll conclude with [Positive] because there are consistent, albeit not overwhelming, signs of positive sentiment towards the stock."
2014-11-27,Neutral,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on a company's stock price based on the given information. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at the tweets provided, all the hashtags used are related to stocks: AT_USER, YHOO, BABA, FB, APLX, GM, GOLD, OQUANTHHA, SPY, and others like CL, CONQUER, etc. Since these seem to be about various tech companies, I'll have to figure out which one is being referred to as the target stock. The user hasn't specified a particular company, so maybe it's referring to YHOO because that's a well-known tech stock. Alternatively, AT_USER might refer to a different company. But since there are multiple stocks mentioned, perhaps each tweet pertains to a different company, making it challenging to determine the target stock. Hmm, this could complicate things. I'll have to be cautious here.

Next, for each relevant tweet, I need to separate the factors into positive and negative. Let's go through them one by one.

1. The first tweet says: ""rt AT_USER yahoo ! : declining business or evolving company ? URL $ aol $ baba $ fb $ twtr $ yhoo"". It mentions YHOO but doesn't specify if it's about AT_USER, BABA, FB, etc., and talks about the company being in decline. The word ""declining"" suggests a negative sentiment.

2. The second tweet is identical to the first one. It also mentions YHOO with the same content, so again, the user is pointing out that there's something wrong with YHOO because it seems like multiple things could be wrong, possibly a typo or misunderstanding of the company name.

3. The third tweet talks about BABA (Balanced Attili Asset Management). It mentions coupons for purchasing on BABA's shopping mall and their efforts to conquer entertainment in China. This is clearly positive, as it suggests a positive aspect related to the stock performance. Also, mentions of gold and stock prices are present here.

4. The fourth tweet discusses financial metrics: sentishiftdown (which I assume means something bad like a drop in sentiment), FB, BABA, APLX, GM, GOLD, OQUANTHHA, SPY, and others like CONQUER. This seems to be about the stock's performance over time and recent events affecting its value.

Now, summarizing each tweet:

1. Negative: YHOO is in decline.
2. Negative: Same as above but also mentions that AT_USER might refer to a different company.
3. Positive: BABA has positive developments like coupons for shopping and entertainment.
4. Mixed or negative: Includes financial metrics related to stock performance.

Putting it all together, the target stock appears to be YHOO. However, since the user didn't specify which one, I'll assume that the tweets are about a specific company whose name isn't provided, but based on context, AT_USER and YHOO might refer to different things. If YHOO is in decline (tweets 1 and 2), that's a strong negative impact. Additionally, tweet 3 mentions BABA positively, which could be another factor.

But since the user didn't specify the target stock symbol, I might need to make an assumption here. Given the context of financial metrics in tweet 4, it's about performance trends rather than specific stocks, so maybe YHOO is not the target but a related company or market? Or perhaps they're all referring to different companies. This ambiguity complicates the analysis because without knowing which stock exactly the user is targeting, it's hard to evaluate its impact.

If I proceed with the assumption that the tweets are about YHOO, then tweet 1 and 2 indicate decline (negative), while tweet 3 and 4 are more about performance trends. But since YHOO isn't mentioned elsewhere, it's challenging.

Alternatively, if the target stock is not specified, maybe all these tweets are about a specific company whose name isn't provided here. Without that information, it's impossible to determine the impact on its stock price because the tweet content doesn't reference any particular stock symbol or context.

Wait, but looking back at the user’s instructions, they said ""given a given company."" So perhaps all these tweets are related to that company, and my job is to analyze them. But in the provided tweets, it's not clear which stock is being referred to because multiple hashtags are used. Maybe I'm supposed to consider that each tweet is about a different company? That would make it difficult because without knowing each company's financial status, it's hard to assess their impact.

But since the user didn't specify a particular company, perhaps the target stock symbol isn't given in any of the tweets, so I can't determine its performance. Alternatively, maybe all these tweets are part of a discussion about YHOO or another related company, but without context, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps each tweet is about different stocks, and my job is just to categorize each as positive, negative, or neutral based on the information given, ignoring which stock it refers to. But that might not make sense because stock prices are influenced by specific companies, so this could lead to incorrect conclusions.

Wait, but in the initial analysis, I identified YHOO from the hashtags. Maybe despite that, each tweet is about a different company related to YHOO? Or maybe they're all separate. Without more context, it's impossible to determine which stock exactly is being referred to, so determining its impact would be flawed.

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake and meant to mention specific companies, but just included multiple hashtags without specifics. In that case, my analysis might be based on general trends rather than the actual company details.

In such cases, I think it's reasonable to proceed with the information given. The tweets mention YHOO in two of them, which suggests that this is a target stock or related. So perhaps each tweet is about YHOO, but some are more positive and others negative. For example:

- Tweet 1 and 2: Negative.
- Tweets 3 and 4: Mixed.

But without knowing if these tweets are all from the same company, it's hard to assess their overall impact on a specific stock because each tweet could be about a different aspect of YHOO or another company. This ambiguity makes it impossible to accurately determine the stock's performance impact based solely on these tweets.

Perhaps the user intended for me to focus only on YHOO and ignore other stocks, assuming all tweets are related to it. In that case:

- Two tweets showing decline (Negative).
- Tweets 3 and 4 discussing trends over time (Neutral or Positive).

But again, without knowing if those tweets are about a specific stock or multiple companies, I can't make an accurate assessment.

Given the uncertainty, maybe I should consider each tweet's sentiment regardless of which company they're talking about. For instance:

- Tweets with negative language (declining, coupons) could indicate concerns that might impact investor sentiment.
- Positive mentions of financial metrics (sentishiftdown) and stock prices might suggest potential gains.

But without a clear target stock symbol, it's impossible to correlate these tweets directly to the company's performance. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that the user intended YHOO as the target stock, despite the ambiguity in the hashtags used across multiple tweets.

In conclusion, based on the provided information and assuming each tweet relates to a specific stock (with most tweets indicating issues with YHOO), I would consider the negative sentiment from tweets 1 and 2, which suggests a decline. Additionally, some positive trends (tweets 3 and 4) might indicate potential gains, but without knowing the context of these other stocks or companies mentioned, it's challenging to weigh them against the target stock's performance.

Therefore, perhaps the overall impact on YHOO is mixed—negative due to declining business/evolving issues, but positive if the other trends suggest better long-term prospects. Without more information, it's difficult to make a precise assessment."
2014-11-28,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, I need to analyze a set of tweets to determine their likely impact on a company's stock price and then conclude with either ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"". 

First, looking at the tweets provided, they all mention ""baba"" which is associated with stock ticker symbol BA. That makes sense because ba usually stands for Bank of America. I should probably focus on how these tweets affect BA's stock.

The first tweet mentions undervalued stock news from an analyst URL. This could mean that people think BA might outperform its current price, so the overall sentiment is positive. 

The second and fourth tweets are also about undervalued stocks. They're repeated, so they reinforce each other. The third tweet talks about BABA breaking above $100 and YHOO hitting its highest price since 2000. That seems like a good news sign because if BA hits $100, it could be attractive to investors. Also, the part where YHOO is at its highest since September 2000 sounds positive, which suggests economic or financial improvement for both companies.

The fifth tweet mentions inspiring a trading interview with a top Supertrades student. While this seems like an exciting event and might boost BA's stock, it doesn't directly address the undervalued aspect as much as the others do. It could be considered a mixed signal because it's positive but not necessarily reinforcing the same sentiment about the stock price.

Putting all these together: tweets 1-4 are focusing on undervaluation, which is a common factor that can lead to a positive impact. The fifth tweet adds some excitement without being as direct in terms of stock performance. So overall, there's a clear indication of potential positive effects because of the multiple mentions of undervalued stocks and specific events like hitting $100 and economic improvement.

Therefore, I think the sentiment is likely Positive."
2014-11-29,Positive,"Alright, let's see what I need to do here. So, the task is to analyze these tweets and figure out if they're going to make my stock price go up, stay the same, or down. Hmm.

First, looking at the target stock symbol in the first tweet. It seems like it might be BABA because of the names like LVGI, CTIX, etc., which are all known symbols for energy companies. So I should focus on how these tweets affect BABA.

Now, each tweet is a ""rt"" followed by some content. The first three tweets just mention an analyst who is undervaluing their stock. That's interesting because it might mean they think the stock is worth less than what other investors are seeing. When analysts say something like that, especially from someone else, it can influence investor sentiment.

In the fourth tweet, there's a mix of things: ""profitable stocks"" and some upgrades. This could be positive because profitable stocks generally look better to investors. But wait, I need to check if these tweets are related to BABA or not. It seems like they're talking more broadly about profits in general.

So the first three tweets are all from someone who's undervaluing BABA. That usually can either push the stock up because people expect higher prices or pull it down. But since the sentiment is consistent across these tweets, and each is positive, maybe this trend continues?

But then comes the fourth tweet, which mentions profitable stocks. If a company is profitable, that could be a good sign because profitability often goes hand in hand with strong earnings, which people like more when they see their stock undervalued. So combining the two factors—undervaluation and profitability—it might reinforce each other.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the last part. Does being profitable always mean it's undervalued? Maybe sometimes a company is profitable but still struggling because of other reasons, which could push the stock down. But here, it seems more likely that they are seeing better-than-expected performance because of higher profits.

Putting it all together: the first three tweets suggest BABA might go up in price. The fourth tweet adds to this by mentioning profitability, which could support the undervaluation. So overall, there's a positive trend being pushed by multiple factors—undervalued and profitable."
2014-11-30,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze the given tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for an unknown company. The tweet provided is ""$ baba filled that gap @ 111.12 to the tee."" 

First, I'll extract the target stock symbol. Looking at the text, it mentions ""baba,"" so the stock symbol must be BABA.

Next, I'll break down each tweet. The tweet seems to mention a gap being filled and adjusting its price from $111.12 to the nearest cent, which is essentially 0 cents. This could indicate that there's an adjustment in pricing or market sentiment around the stock.

I'm considering whether this is positive, negative, or neutral regarding the company's performance. The mention of filling a gap and adjusting the price seems like it might be signaling a situation where the stock value is increasing or stable. It doesn't explicitly state a positive or negative outcome, but the adjustment to zero cents could imply that the market either recognizes this change or reacts positively.

Considering the context around financial adjustments or price changes often reflects investor confidence. If the stock gap is being filled, it might suggest better expectations or support from investors, which could be a positive indicator for future performance.

Therefore, after evaluating the factors and sentiment, I conclude that the tweet presents a neutral outlook on the stock."
2014-12-01,Neutral,"Okay, I need to figure out how these tweets are affecting BABA stock. Let's go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet says $BABA is looking more bearish after a nice run in October. That suggests they're worried about a downturn ahead, so it's negative.
2. The second tweet mentions alibaba dropping 5% and trading below $110 per share. A significant drop might indicate concern, which could be negative for BABA.
3-6 tweets are all from the same user discussing Black Friday sales. They're talking about how much BABA can go down in price, which seems like a positive sign because it shows potential growth despite some uncertainty.
7 mentions market snapshot with s&P 500 and Dow falling due to weak economic data and nasdaq dropping 7 weeks. This could suggest negative news affecting the overall stock.
8 says $BABA is at its first 50% Fibonacci retracement, which might indicate a new high or low, but it's just one point away from that level, so not sure yet.
9 talks about $BABA being available for Singapore, Thailand, Korea, and Macau. This could open new trading opportunities, which might be positive for the stock.
10 mentions alibaba allowing payment for transit cards in these countries and targeting their affiliate marketing. This seems like a strategic move that could positively impact BABA's sales.

Now, combining all these factors: the user is worried about a possible drop but also showing some optimism due to new opportunities and planned sales moves. However, there are points of uncertainty about economic data affecting the market. It's balanced but leans towards positive but not overwhelmingly so."
2014-12-02,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of BABA. Let's see what each tweet says.

1. The first tweet mentions that analysts are undervaluing BABA and provides specific stocks. This might mean investors think they can buy at a lower price than current levels, which could be positive for some.
2. The second tweet says ""short $ baba at 108 seems topppy."" toppy suggests something's bad with shorting the stock, which could hurt investors.
3. More tweets like this show a mix of positive mentions of BABA and negative ones about shorting or other stocks. This makes it hard to tell if the sentiment is overall positive or negative because of varying viewpoints.
4. Many of these tweets are repeating similar messages, so they don't contribute new information but just reinforce the same concerns.

Considering all these points, I'm not sure the sentiment is clearly positive or negative. The mixed content and conflicting opinions make it hard to gauge a clear trend. So maybe the overall impact is neutral."
2014-12-03,Neutral,"Alright, let's break down how I would approach analyzing these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price for the given company.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking through the provided tweets, none of them explicitly mention a specific stock. That might make it tricky because I don't know which stock we're focusing on here. Without knowing the exact stock, it's hard to assess its performance or impact on other stocks.

Next, for each tweet, I'll separate the factors into positive and negative ones. For example, in the first tweet, ""wowser $ eled in breakout mode . going long on the 8k news . $ aegr $ baba $ amat"" has multiple stock mentions: aegr, baba, amat. The words like ""breakout mode"" and ""longing on the 8k news"" suggest investor sentiment towards the stock.

But wait, since I don't have the exact stock symbol, I can't look it up easily. So, without knowing the target stock, I might be missing crucial information about its historical performance or current market conditions, which are essential for evaluating the tweet's impact.

Looking at the second tweet, it mentions top five traded equities: aapl, baba, jnug, tasr, and twtr. Again, no specific stock is mentioned here either. The mention of ""top five traded equities"" might indicate that these could be competitors or related products, but without knowing which one the user is focusing on, it's difficult to assess their impact.

The third tweet is a comment on stocktwits: $ baba needs to break hod once more time baby .. URL. The term ""babodds"" is common in tech discussions and might imply positive sentiment towards the stock, especially if it's related to a company with strong momentum or a product that's gaining traction.

The fourth tweet says: AT_USER AT_USER q what $ baba us goods are you refer to ? . $ wmt $ amzn etc do this already with imports . hello. The mention of ""you refer to"" suggests the user is talking about something else, possibly unrelated, which might not have any impact on the stock in question.

The fifth tweet: rt AT_USER jack ma added $ 647m to his fortune yday , leading all asian billionaires , as $ baba rose 3.7 % , the most in three weeks . … The use of ""jack ma"" is a well-known figure in tech, and mentioning a stock that's up significantly could be a positive sign for the company.

The sixth tweet: toptickertweets $ aapl $ spy $ baba $ amzn $ tasr $ abx $ qqq $ iwm $ rig $ usd quantheta sentiquant. Again, multiple stocks mentioned here—APL, SPY (which is SPDR S&P 500 ETF), BABA, AMZN, etc.—so without knowing which stock the user is referring to, it's hard to gauge their impact.

Given all these tweets, it seems like they're either discussing general trends or specific companies that aren't clearly identified. Since I can't pinpoint the exact stock, the analysis becomes challenging because each tweet might be affecting different stocks in various ways—some positive, some negative, and others unrelated or too speculative to assess.

However, considering the presence of terms like ""baba rose 3.7%,"" which is a significant increase, it might indicate that the stock has had positive news related to a specific product or company. On the other hand, mentions of jack ma could be positive for tech stocks, but without context, it's speculative.

In conclusion, without knowing the exact target stock from these tweets, I can't accurately determine if the overall sentiment is positive, neutral, or negative. Each tweet might be impacting different stocks in various ways, making it hard to aggregate a single assessment."
2014-12-04,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets regarding the stock market impact. First, I need to identify each tweet's target stock symbol because the user wants the analysis for a specific company.

Looking at the tweets, some of them mention $ baba and others like $ fnma or $ amzn. The example provided includes three positive tweets: 1, 4, and 8. But since I don't have the exact symbols from all five tweets given here, I'll focus on those that include $ baba.

The user wants a conclusion of [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

In tweet 1, AT_USER is analyzing options strategies for $ fnma, Aapl, Baba, and Amzn. This indicates interest in BABA stock but not exclusively positive about the company itself.

 Tweet 2 mentions treelighting by Aapl's audience but doesn't focus on BABA specifically. So maybe it's a secondary mention or unrelated.

Tweet 3 talks about Yahoo raising its price target at $55 and Alibaba going up to $150, which is interesting but not directly related to BABA.

 Tweets 4, 7, and 8 don't mention the stock in question. Tweet 4 is similar to tweet 1, tweet 7 discusses a chart about BABA, and tweet 8 mentions BCLN, which isn't specified. 

However, given that the user provided at least three positive tweets (tweets 1,4,8), but some are about other stocks. Without knowing the exact target stock, it's challenging to assess the overall sentiment.

But since the example used [Positive] for three tweets and didn't mention any negatives or neutrals elsewhere, I'll stick with a positive conclusion."
2014-12-05,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me start by breaking down what's required.

First, there are three steps mentioned: identifying the target stock symbol, analyzing each tweet in chunks, separating positive and negative factors, assessing sentiment for each tweet, and then combining those sentiments into an overall conclusion. The output has to be one of ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"".

Looking at the tweets provided:

1. ""rtk nasdaq $ rtk $ gdxj $ alsk $ baba $ nke buy ? , chart , close , recent news , alert stock quote URL URL""
2. ""honesty finally ! ! ! AT_USER $ yhoo would be dead right now w / o $ baba don't buy AT_USER unless you want to throw away your money that is .""

I need to identify the target stock from these tweets. The first tweet mentions ""rtk nasdaq"" and a bunch of other symbols, but it doesn't mention any specific stock or symbol. The second tweet starts with ""honesty finally"" which might relate to something like BABA (Balancing Group Invested Capital), but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe there's more context needed here.

But actually, in the initial analysis provided by the assistant, they took both tweets and determined that the target stock is BABA. Let me check again: The first tweet has a mention of ""gdxj"", which might be GDX (Gold Shares), but I'm not certain. However, the second tweet starts with ""honesty finally"" followed by AT_USER $ yhoo, which could be referencing BABA because ""BHWA"" is short for Balancing Group Invested Capital. So that must be it. So the target stock symbol is BHWA.

Now, moving on to analyzing each tweet in chunks:

1. For the first tweet: It lists several stocks (rtk nasdaq, rtk $ gdxj, etc.), mentions ""buy"" and a list of factors like chart, recent news, alert for the stock quote URL. The sentiment is positive because it's offering to buy BHWA but providing information about other stocks which might influence investor interest.
2. For the second tweet: It starts with ""honesty finally"" followed by AT_USER $ yhoo. This seems like a short sell or speculation, maybe indicating uncertainty. The mention of AT_USER suggests a social media platform use, possibly related to trading strategies. The sentiment here is negative because it's suggesting that the user may be going against BHWA's fundamentals and could be a risk.

Putting this together: The first tweet is positive in offeringBHWA but provides additional information, while the second tweet is negative due to speculation or uncertainty about the stock's value.

Combining these factors, there seems to be some conflicting sentiment. Some investors might see the first tweet as beneficial (positive), others might take away from BHWA if the second tweet is taken seriously. The overall sentiment isn't clear because it depends on how much each tweet influences investor sentiment collectively.

However, considering that one tweet is positive and another is negative, the impact could be considered neutral because the effects are somewhat balanced but not consistently in either direction."
2014-12-06,Positive,"Alright, let me break down how I arrived at the conclusion for the stock's impact on future price.

First, I looked at each tweet to identify whether it's positive or negative. The user mentioned multiple tweets about stock analyst findings and reports, which usually indicates confidence or analysis about a company's performance. Since there are consistent mentions of ""best options strategies"" and ""profit estimates,"" this suggests that the market is assessing the company positively.

I then evaluated each tweet to see if they mention any specific stocks, especially ""baba"" or other notable ones like ""aapl."" The fact that many tweets focus on these companies shows confidence in their valuation, which can lead investors to think the stock is undervalued. That's a positive sign because undervalued stocks are expected to rise.

Overall, all the tweets highlight analysis and reports that support an upward trend for the target company. Therefore, combining these factors—positive sentiment from multiple sources and confident reports—the conclusion is that the stock is likely to have a positive impact moving forward."
2014-12-07,Positive,"Okay, so I need to determine the impact on a company's stock price based on these tweets. Let me start by understanding what each tweet is about.

The first tweet says ""rt AT_USER stock analyst finds best options strategies $ aapl $ baba $ amzn $ fnma URL."" The word ""best options strategies"" suggests that they are looking for investment advice, possibly from other users. It's not clear if this indicates positive or negative sentiment yet, but it seems like they're actively considering stocks.

The second tweet is exactly the same as the first one, so no new information there. It reinforces that AT_USER is assessing options strategies, maybe indicating a focus on potential gains.

Moving on to the third tweet: ""undervalued stock picks for the week of december 8 , 2014 $ ebay $ ctix $ baba URL."" This mentions valuations and picking undervalued stocks. It looks like they're suggesting buying stocks that are underpriced, which would likely lead to a positive impact on their price because undervalued stocks might see higher prices.

The fourth tweet: ""rt AT_USER stock analyst issues new reports and opinions on top stocks $ plkd $ sttk $ fvrg $ clf $ baba $ aapl URL."" Here, they're updating reports. If the reports are about major companies, it could mean that there's a lot of information being shared regarding their performance or financials. This can sometimes signal positive news if the information is positive.

The fifth tweet is the same as the fourth one: ""rt AT_USER stock analyst issues new reports and opinions on top stocks $ plkd $ sttk $ fvrg $ clf $ baba $ aapl URL."" Again, repeating the same thing, so no new info this time.

Lastly, the sixth tweet: ""rt AT_USER stock analyst finds best options strategies $ aapl $ baba $ amzn $ fnma URL."" Similar to the first and second tweets, it's about assessing options strategies but again, not providing any valuation or market update.

Now, combining all these factors. The third tweet explicitly mentions undervalued stocks for December 8th, which is probably in the past year. It suggests that people are looking to buy stocks they think are undervalued. If this information leads to increased demand for those stocks, it could be a positive sign because undervalued stocks might appreciate in price.

The other tweets talk about reports and analyst opinions. If these reports indicate better performance or new developments that could boost certain companies' stock prices, that would contribute positively. The repeated mentions of ""best options strategies"" might suggest they're preparing for future investments, possibly expecting a good outcome which would be positive news.

So putting it all together: undervalued stocks are being picked up, reports about better performance or new info are being issued. These signals could lead to increased interest in those stocks, potentially causing a positive impact on their price."
2014-12-08,Neutral,"Okay, I'm trying to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided 21 tweets, so let's start by identifying the target stock symbol from each tweet. 

Looking at the tweets, it seems they're all about ""baba"" or related stocks. Specifically, some mention AT_USER $ baba, others talk about payments from alibaba and cramerq, and some are just general statements about investors. But there's no explicit mention of the target stock symbol in any of these tweets.

Since I can't extract a specific stock symbol, it's tricky because it means I don't have enough information to assess how each tweet affects the stock price directly. Without knowing what each tweet is about and which specific stock they're discussing, I can't determine if there are positive, neutral, or negative factors influencing the company's performance.

However, looking at the overall sentiment aspect: some tweets express concerns about a potential ""flash crash"" or may need to pivot their business. These seem like bearish signals because they mention financial instability or market fluctuations. Others talk about trends, stock performance, and investors' outlooks, which can sometimes be positive but without specific context, it's hard to categorize them as clearly positive or negative.

I'm leaning towards a mix of mixed sentiment, considering some tweets are definitely negative due to investor concerns, while others might have vague or inconclusive information. Without more details on each tweet's content and its direct impact on the stock price, I can't provide a definitive conclusion. It seems the user needs more information about which specific stock they're referring to or additional context from the tweets."
2014-12-09,Negative,"Alright, I'm trying to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet one by one and see what they're saying.

First, in tweet 1, it mentions ""big reversal off 50% fib."" That sounds like significant movement but not extremely negative or positive. It might be a mix, so maybe neutral.

Next, tweets 2 to 4 are about listing multiple stocks: Aapl, Amzn, Baba, etc. These are broad market announcements rather than individual stock analyses, so they probably don't have a big impact on the price of a single stock.

Then, tweet 5 talks about Cuban dissing on $baba. That's pretty serious and negative news from a political standpoint. It could potentially affect investor sentiment.

Tweets 6 refers to $baba showing up after some days, so it's like confirming the information mentioned in tweet 5. This might confirm a trend but doesn't change the sentiment much.

Tweet 7 introduces Leilani talking about Jack Ma and pollution, using an analogy with an air purifier. That seems unrelated and probably won't affect the stock price negatively.

Tweets 8 is another list of top stocks, again broad market info that doesn't directly relate to a specific company's performance.

In tweet 9, they mention Alpha.com's transaction data from mobile devices, which could indicate growth in mobile users. That might show positive trends but not necessarily a direct impact on a stock unless it's related.

Tweets 10-15 are about $baba's price movements and other top stocks. Some mentions of percentages (like 105.07) could mean the stock is at a higher point, which might be seen as positive. However, overall, these seem to provide market context rather than specific stock news.

Putting it all together, tweet 5 and its subsequent tweets give serious info about Cuban dissents on $baba, which likely sent a negative signal to investors. The other tweets mostly confirm or provide background but don't address the stock's performance directly. So, overall sentiment seems negative."
2014-12-10,Negative,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company based on their content. The user provided 15 tweets and an example output which I can refer to for guidance.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. It seems like the main mention is $ baba, so the stock in question is BABA (BABA). 

Now, looking at each tweet one by one:

1. The first tweet says ""500 limit order 92.00"" which doesn't directly relate to BABA.
2. Tweets 2-3 mention AT_USER talking about top stocks, analysts, options picks, and details for companies including BABA. These are general comments about the companies without specific information on BABA's performance.
3. Tweets from 4-15 all focus on $ baba's price: ""rt AT_USER..."" followed by details about other companies and discount_price. The last tweet says ""$ baba is just crazy at that price!"" This uses words like ""crazy"" and ""discount_price,"" which might imply positive because it suggests the stock is undervalued or expected to perform well.

Considering the overall sentiment, these tweets are expressing concern about the stock's value and mentioning things like cash flow, fundamental strengths, and a discount price. These are all positive signs pointing towards an upward trend."
2014-12-11,Neutral,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The stock symbol given is ""baba"" and it's mentioned as ""aapl"". Wait, that doesn't seem right because aapl would be Apple Inc., but baba is Alphabet Soup Inc. So maybe the user meant to refer to another company? Hmm, maybe it's a typo or just using different symbols for clarity.

Anyway, focusing on the two tweets provided: 

1. ""alipay wallet + apple’s touch id $ aapl $ baba URL"" – I think this one might be talking about Alpaoy and Apple's contact ID on their mobile app. But the context seems like it could be indicating something about investments or stock movements, but it's not very clear how it relates to the overall market.

2. ""AT_USER dshd have played ipo 2 $ momo .. didn’t know street had this fetish 4 $ baba ; any association to it , they keep gobbling it up"" – This tweet seems more mysterious. The mention of a user playing an IPO sounds like speculation, possibly related to stock market trends. ""Momo"" is slang for ""maybe"" or ""something,"" and ""fetish"" could indicate someone's interest in stocks. However, the context isn't very clear.

Now, considering these tweets from an investor's perspective, both seem speculative and lack concrete information about the company. The first tweet might be unrelated, while the second suggests possible investment interest but doesn’t provide a solid basis for predicting stock movements.

Putting it all together, without any actual data or positive indicators, each tweet seems to have little impact on the stock price. Therefore, the overall sentiment is likely neutral."
2014-12-12,Positive,"Alright, let me tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine the likely impact on the stock price of a company based on given tweets and categorize it as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the tweets provided, they all mention ""aapl"" which stands for Apple Inc., so that's our target stock. 

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one. Each tweet is quite similar in content, just slightly worded differently. The key elements are mentioning top stock analyst picks, options, or choices details related to companies like Apple, Amazon, Betaas, etc.

For each tweet, I need to break down the factors and assess their sentiment. Factors include things like top analyst picks, whether it's a pick or choice, specific stocks mentioned (like $aapl), and any URL references which might indicate more detailed information about options or analyst choices.

Looking at tweet 1: It mentions ""top stock analyst pick list details"" and lists several companies including Apple. Since these are positive statements about top picks, the sentiment is positive.

Similarly, tweet 2 follows the same structure as tweet 1, just with a slightly different URL. It reinforces the idea of top analyst choices for Apple.

Now, tweets 3 to 4 repeat this pattern: top stock analyst pick lists again, all pointing to Apple. This repetition suggests continued positive sentiment from multiple sources or users.

Tweets 5 onwards start listing options and analyst details. These can be a mix because some might mention options picks and others could be more general. But the primary content here is still about Apple's top choices.

Each of these tweets points towards an expectation that Apple will have strong stock performance based on Analyst predictions or choices. Since all tweets are reinforcing the positive aspects related to Apple, especially with their names (aapl), it builds confidence in Apple's future prospects.

Putting this together: Each tweet is focused on Apple's top analyst picks and options, which indicate investor confidence in their decisions. There's no negative language here; everything is positive regarding how Apple can perform with the analysts' guidance.

So combining all these factors—consistent focus on positive aspects, varied but mostly Apple-related—leads to an overall Positive sentiment."
2014-12-13,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided three tweets and wants me to evaluate each one as either positive, neutral, or negative.

First, looking at tweet 1: ""rt AT_USER 262 ipos this year , + 25 % y / y and most since 2000 ! $ momo $ lc $ wk $ baba $ w $ hubs $ hdp $ newr URL"". This seems like positive because it mentions a significant increase of 25%, the stock is ""most since 2000"", and includes terms like ""baba"" which might be related to tech stocks. The mention of the user's tweet suggests support from others, so this is likely positive.

Next, tweet 2: ""$ baba 200 simple moving average $ baba most recent stock chart and technical analysis . $ fxe $ bac $ adt $ hele $ ss URL"". This one also mentions ""baba"", which again points to a tech-related stock. The terms like ""simple moving average"" and ""technical analysis"" add credibility, but I'm not sure if it's positive or negative without more context. It seems like just some information about the stock, so maybe neutral.

Finally, tweet 3: ""URL has 6 pro traders in their chat room . real-time trade alerts , and offer a 14 - day trial . $ goog $ baba $ yhoo $ twtr"". This tweet is positive because it mentions multiple tech companies like Google, Microsoft (GOOG), Apple (YHOO), and Microsoft. Protruded traders are often seen as positive for investor confidence.

Putting it all together: tweet 1 is clearly positive due to the significant increase and mention of user interaction. Tweet 2 might have a slight push but isn't strong enough to outweigh the other positives. Tweet 3 is definitely positive from multiple angles. So overall, these tweets collectively indicate a positive sentiment towards the stock."
2014-12-14,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided two specific tweets and asked for an analysis in terms of positive, neutral, or negative impact.

First, I need to understand what each tweet is saying. 

Looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER top stock analyst pick list details $ aapl $ amzn $ baba $ msft $ ebay $ tgt $ sbux URL"". It seems like this tweet is offering information about potential stocks that are suggested by top analysts. The mention of specific stock symbols like ABL, AMZN, etc., suggests they're providing a list or analysis. This could be helpful for investors looking to trade these stocks.

The second tweet: ""my video URL stock mkt analysis 12/12 / 14 $ spy $ qqq $ uso $ gld $ baba $ aapl $ gpro $ infn $ nvax $ iwm"". Here, the tweet is offering information about future market data and specific stocks. The inclusion of "" spies"" might indicate that someone is predicting significant events related to these companies.

Now, I need to evaluate each tweet's impact on stock price. 

For the first tweet, providing a list of potential stocks could be beneficial for investors if they're looking to buy. If ABL or another company is expected to perform well, it might increase its price. However, since this tweet doesn't specify any predictions or specific details about performance, I'm not sure if it's directly influencing the stock price.

The second tweet mentions "" spies"" and predicts future data but doesn't give specifics on which stocks are being analyzed. Predictions can sometimes affect investor sentiment, especially if there are positive or negative forecasts. However, without knowing how these predictions are implemented (like through earnings reports or financial news), it's hard to gauge the impact.

Considering both tweets, neither seems to offer specific information about upcoming events related to a particular stock. They might be providing market data and potential stocks for analysis but don't predict which ones will perform well. Therefore, they might not have a direct positive or negative effect on the stock price.

So, after analyzing each tweet, I can conclude that there's no clear indication of a positive, neutral, or negative impact on the stock price based on these tweets alone."
2014-12-15,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the likely impact on the stock price of the company based on these tweets. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbols from the tweets: ABBVIE (baba), AMZN (aapl), BABA (amzn), MSFT (msft), EBay (ebay), and SBUX (sbux). So that's six different stocks. I need to analyze each one separately.

Starting with tweet 1, it mentions top stock options analyst details picking the top stocks: ABBVIE, AMZN, BABA, MSFT, EBEY, TGT. That seems like a bunch of names without any positive or negative indicators. It's just listing options pickers. So this one doesn't seem to have a strong sentiment.

Similarly, tweets 2 and 3 are the same as tweet 1 but repeated, so they all list these names in the same way. I'm not seeing any positive or negative words here either.

Moving on to tweet 4, it lists top stock analyst pick details: ABBVIE, AMZN, BABA, MSFT, EBEY, TGT, SBUX. Again, a list of things without any sentiment language. So this is the same as tweets 1-3 but includes SBUX.

Tweets 5 and 6 are also lists with similar content: ABBVIE, AMZN, BABA, MSFT, EBEY, TGT. No positive or negative words here either.

Now tweet 7 mentions picking a top stock analyst pick list details including ABBVIE, AMZN, BABA, MSFT, EBEY, TGT, SBUX. So again, all names but no sentiment.

Tweets 8 and 9 are similar: listing the same stocks without any positive or negative language. No impact here either.

Finally, tweet 10 lists ABBVIE, AMZN, BABA, MSFT, EBEY, TGT. No more information.

So looking at all these tweets together, each one is just a list of stock names from different sources but without any positive, negative, or neutral language. It's like they're trying to collect information on the stocks but not giving a clear direction or opinion.

In terms of sentiment analysis, none of these tweets are expressing any expectation about what will happen next. They don't have words like ""up,"" ""down,"" ""good,"" or ""bad."" Instead, they just list the names and perhaps some technical details from analysts. It's more about collecting info than predicting market movement.

I think that without specific information on how these stocks are expected to perform, like earnings reports, economic news, or other indicators, it's hard to assess whether this affects the stock price positively, neutrally, or negatively. The list itself isn't providing any actionable insight into what to expect next week.

So in conclusion, since all tweets are just listing names without any sentiment or analysis, I can't conclude a positive, neutral, or negative impact on the stock price. It seems like they're more about gathering info than predicting market movements."
2014-12-16,Negative,"Alright, so I need to analyze the given tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let's break down how I should approach this.

First, looking at each tweet individually seems manageable since there are 28 of them. Each one talks about finding specific stocks like BABA (TSLA), UUP, etc., either through analyst picks or other themes. The user is looking for the next $baba, which makes me think they're seeking investment opportunities.

I notice that many tweets are repeating similar information, mentioning different stocks but focusing on BABA a lot. This repetition suggests consistent interest and attention to the stock. There's no clear positive or negative mention here; it's more about the user searching for this specific stock.

The other tweets talk about analyst pick lists and themes related to BABA, UUP, etc., but they don't have any explicit sentiment like ""buy"" or ""sell."" They're just listing possible stocks. So from my perspective, these are just supporting the user's search strategy without influencing their opinions on buying or selling.

When I look at all 28 tweets, there isn't a single tweet that mentions something positive or negative about BABA. All of them are encouraging the user to find $baba and are focused on listing possible stocks. There's no news about stock performance, earnings, economic indicators, etc., so the sentiment here is pretty neutral.

Since the user is actively searching for BABA but isn't making a recommendation or expecting a specific action, I can't see any positive or negative intent towards the stock price. Therefore, overall, it seems like the tweets are just a series of requests and information without any explicit influence on investor sentiment.

So putting it all together, each tweet is just supporting the user's strategy but doesn't provide any indication of whether to buy, sell, or keep the stock. Hence, the overall impact should be neutral."
2014-12-17,Positive,"Alright, let's see what I need to do here. The user has provided some tweets and wants me to analyze them to determine their impact on a given company's stock price. They have specified that my answer should be either [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative].

First, I need to understand the task properly. From the previous message, they gave an example of analyzing two tweets and concluding with a single line. So, in this case, I'm dealing with five tweets related to stock symbols like BABA (baba), FB, NFLX, etc.

The first step is to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Let me look through the tweets one by one:

1. The first tweet mentions ""baba alibaba group holding ltd ."", so the target stock symbol seems to be ""baba"".
2. The second tweet lists several stocks: wall street breakfast, oil prices sliding, and others like spy, qqq, alsmy, app, baba, etc.
3. The third tweet also lists baba as a focus.
4. The fourth tweet mentions strong internet stocks.
5. The fifth tweet again mentions baba.

Wait, the second tweet seems to have multiple target stocks, including ""wall street breakfast"", which isn't a known stock. But considering context like oil prices sliding could affect related stocks if they are in the oil sector or energy. But given that it's a separate list, maybe I should prioritize based on other factors. However, without specific information about how each tweet affects the target stock, it might be tricky.

But looking at the instructions, for each tweet, I need to check the positive and negative factors. Let me break down each tweet:

1. ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . ( baba ) 107.79 +2.02 (+1.91 % ) $ fnma $ amgn $ tna URL"" – This seems like a company profile, so the target stock is probably baba. The numbers here indicate a price movement of +2.02%, which could be an indicator of positive news about the stock.

2. ""wall street breakfast : oil prices slide ahead of fed meeting URL $ spy $ qqq $ alsmy $ app $ baba $ bidu $ bncc $ clfd $ ge"" – This tweet mentions oil prices sliding, but it's not a known stock symbol unless these are related companies in the energy sector. The mention of ""wall street breakfast"" doesn't add much context on what's being sold or bought here.

3. ""$ baba just thinking about the 50 . i added a small position today b / c it was beating my trendline up . will add more AT_USER also use area as stop"" – This is another company profile, so target stock seems to be ""baba"". The sentiment here seems positive because the user is trying to adjust their portfolio.

4. ""$ strong internet stocks so far $ fb $ nflx $ baba $ lnkd"" – This is a list of specific stocks. Since it mentions ""strong internet stocks"", it might indicate that these companies are doing well in the tech sector, but without knowing which specific stock (like FB or NFLX) is being referred to, it's hard to assess impact.

5. ""$ baba on fire this morning ... $ fb looks great too"" – Again, another company profile for ""baba"". The sentiment here is positive because it talks about the company being in a good spot.

Now, I need to analyze each tweet's factors and sentiment towards the target stock. For tweet 1, the price moved up by +2%, which could be seen as positive news affecting baba.

Tweet 3 also mentions adding a small position, which is a common strategy in investing that can lead to gains.

Tweets 4 and 5 are about internet stocks, but since they don't specify the target stock beyond ""strong internet"", I'm not sure how they directly impact a specific stock like FB or NFLX. If these stocks are strong in general, it might positively affect investors' sentiment across the board, influencing the overall market.

However, considering that some tweets are about other companies (like spy, alsmy) which may have different impacts depending on their performance. But if they're unrelated to the target stock's performance, it's less likely to influence its price significantly.

Putting this together:

- Tweet 1: Positive news for baba.
- Tweet 3: Positive action, possibly short-term profit.
- Tweets 4 and 5: Strong sector performance affecting investor sentiment.

The output requires a single conclusion. Given that tweet 1 shows an upward move in baba's price, which is positive, and the other tweets indicate general market strength or sector health, the overall impact seems positive.

So, I think the overall sentiment should be [Positive]."
2014-12-18,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out how these tweets are going to affect the stock price of BABA. Let me start by looking at each tweet one by one.

The first tweet is: ""$ baba im out this junk , tomorrow will be unlock day this stock is garbage for me."" Hmm, that sounds like it's selling BABA because they're saying the stock isn't good. The words ""junk"" and ""garbage"" make me think the user is upset or critical of the stock. So I guess this is a negative sentiment.

The second tweet: ""myec insider disclosure $ myec $ ziop $ baba $ arwr $ snss buy ? , current price , current price , recent news , on radar st URL."" This seems like someone is inside BABA and they're showing them some other stock, which might mean they are in the process of buying or managing it. They also have a question mark at the end, maybe signaling uncertainty about the company's situation. The mention of ""current price"" suggests that this is related to the stock market analysis, so overall, it seems positive because there's an action being taken or information being shared.

The third tweet: ""$ dnkn $ rad $ pwe $ glng $ bhi $ tasr $ swks $ lnkd $ opk $ swir $ goog $ wfm $ yhoo $ baba $ gpro $ orcl $ dgly URL."" This looks like a list of investments. The words ""dnkn,"" ""rad,"" and others make me think it's a mix of different stocks. It doesn't mention anything about BABA, so I don't see any direct impact on the stock. Maybe some investor interest is being tracked here, but since there's nothing specific related to BABA, this tweet isn't directly affecting its price.

Now, considering all these tweets together: The first one clearly has a negative tone because of the ""garbage"" and ""junk."" The second tweet indicates that someone inside is trying to manage or buy the stock, which usually hints at positive sentiment. The third tweet just shows interest in other stocks without any mention of BABA, so it's neutral.

So putting it all together: Two negative tweets from the first and a mix of positive and neutral from the others. It seems like there are some mixed signals here—some people are suggesting selling, while others are showing interest in other stuff. But I think the overall sentiment is leaning towards negative because the majority of the tweets have a negative tone.

Wait, but the second tweet might be a bit more than just selling. The ""buy ?"" suggests they're taking an action, maybe indicating some level of excitement or uncertainty about BABA's performance. So combining both negatives and a mix of positive actions, it's hard to say if overall it's positive or negative. Maybe there's enough negativity from the first tweet that it outweighs the others.

Alternatively, perhaps the second tweet is part of a strategy where they're looking for investment opportunities, which could be positive. But since the other tweets are about selling, maybe the overall market reaction isn't clear-cut. It seems like it might have mixed signals but leans more towards negative because of the strong negativity in the first tweet.

I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should check if there's any trend or pattern. The first tweet is a sale, the second is an action to buy, and the third is just interest. That doesn't seem like a clear positive or negative trend. It might be a mix of selling and buying, which could mean some people are short on BABA, but without more info, it's hard to tell.

I think I'll go with [Neutral] because while there are negative tweets, the majority (the first one) is very negative, and the others don't support the positive side enough to outweigh that."

2014-12-20,Missing,File not found
2014-12-21,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. The user has given me four tweets and asked to analyze them based on the stock symbols provided.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. It seems like the symbol is ""spx"" which stands for the S&P 500 index. That makes sense because the other stocks listed are all part of that index.

Now, looking at each tweet:

1. The first tweet says: ""rt AT_USER my video URL stock mkt analysis 12/12 / 14 $ spy $ qqq $ uso $ gld $ baba $ aapl $ gpro $ infn $ nvax $ iwm"". It mentions multiple stocks but doesn't specify which one is the target. Since it's about market analysis, I'll assume ""spx"" or another index symbol like ""sp500"".

2. The second tweet starts with ""@TREMMY"" and says: ""rt @TREMMY big earnings report! 1/9 $ TSMN $ TSMF $ GM $ JPM"". This is about earnings, which can be positive or negative depending on the company.

3. The third tweet mentions a Twitter account named ""TREMMY"": ""RT @TREMMY why not share this video? #FinancialAnalysis @MoneyQuotes #Stock Market #Investing #EarningsReport #Bull sharpie"". No specific stock symbol here, but again pointing to a market analysis.

4. The fourth tweet is just an emoji: ""RT @TREMMY hello everyone! 2/13 / 15 $ TSMN $ TSMF $. #FinancialAnalysis #Investing #Earnings Report #Bull sharpie"". Similar structure as the second tweet about earnings reports.

From these tweets, it seems like they're all related to financial analysis and upcoming earnings. The user is preparing for a market analysis video or making predictions based on past performance (like ""baba"" in one of them, which might be a typo for ""GM"", but given the context, I'll consider it as part of the earnings report).

Given that these tweets are about earnings reports and market trends, they can influence investor sentiment positively if people expect strong earnings. However, without specific information on the companies' performance or future expectations, it's hard to tell if there's a positive or negative effect.

But considering the context around financial analysis and upcoming earnings, especially from a company like ""GM"" which is a well-known player in the automotive industry, it might generally be viewed as a positive sign. However, without knowing the exact performance data or recent news, I can't make a 100% sure decision.

I think the safest assumption here is that since these tweets are about earnings reports and financial analysis, they're likely to influence investor sentiment positively because people might look ahead and see strong figures, which can boost the stock price."
2014-12-22,Neutral,"Okay, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at tweet 1: It mentions an end-of-year reversal URL for the SPY stock and lists several stocks that are trading. This is a general update about investments, which might be seen as positive because it's providing useful information to investors. However, I don't have specific data on how much this affects the overall sentiment.

Tweet 2 talks about valuing the spy company and quoting others like iwm, aapl, baba, etc., but again, without specifics on the price changes or how they affect users' decisions, it's hard to assess sentiment here.

Tweet 3 discusses whether uber is the next big tech company after alibaba. It seems speculative but mentions an IPO event for baba. While this could be viewed positively if it's a positive sign for the market, it might not have enough weight in the overall tweet analysis.

Tweet 4 reports that alibaba had a pre-acquisition loss of $57 million and is using their stock ticker URL. This information is important because losses can affect investor sentiment negatively. However, I don't know how significant this loss is or how quickly they'll be revealed to the public.

Putting it all together: The tweets provide general market updates about tech companies but none are specific to a particular stock. They talk about valuations and investor comments without giving clear direction on where things are heading. Therefore, each tweet can have varying impacts depending on the company's actual performance, but without that info, I can't confidently label them as positive, neutral, or negative."
2014-12-23,Positive,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze the given tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of $BABA. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

Starting with the first tweet: ""AT_USER alibaba inches closer to an apple pay deal , one fingerprint at a time : URL $ baba"". This seems like a positive statement about the company, mentioning something about getting closer to a payment deal. Positive factors could be that the company is making progress on a major project.

The second tweet is a link to a article about YHOO, but I'm not sure if that's relevant because it mentions ""essentially worth nothing except for $baba stake."" That sounds like it might be negative or neutral since it's talking about the stock being undervalued by another company. But without context from other tweets, it's hard to assess.

The third tweet is again a link, mentioning $BABA and something called ""long setup."" I don't know much about the specifics here, but maybe indicating some action that could be positive or neutral if related to growth.

The fourth tweet talks about picking up the stock at $104 with a trailing stop. This seems like it's providing buy signals, which would likely be positive for the stock price.

The fifth tweet mentions the China retail market growing 3 times faster than the overall retail market and is linked to Alipay on $BABA. That could be seen as positive if the market growth indicates good demand or opportunities, which might push the stock up.

The sixth tweet is another link about Alibaba, talking about fighting counterfeits since 2013. While this seems negative regarding security concerns, it's not directly linked to stock performance unless someone believes that relates to the company's valuation.

Considering all these tweets, the main positive factors seem to be the progress towards a payment deal (first tweet), selling at a higher price ($104 with trailing stop) (fourth tweet), and Alipay market growth (fifth tweet). The negative points include the article linked to YHOO and the security counterfeits mentioned.

The overall sentiment seems positive because there are several factors that could drive up the stock, like progress on a project, strong buying signals, and potential market trends. While one is still negative in context, the positives outweigh the negatives enough to make it [Positive]."
2014-12-24,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether these tweets are positive, negative, or neutral in terms of impact on a company's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol that's mentioned is ""KMB"". I should probably check if there's any context about KMB before making my analysis, but since it's not provided here, maybe I can infer it from the tweets. The first tweet says ""$ xbi filings updated wednesday , december 24 , 2014 08:59 : 23 am $ kmb $ celg $ f $ baba URL"". Hmm, that looks like an exchange or a stock listing. Maybe KMB is part of the S&P 500? I'm not sure without more context.

Next tweet: ""$ vips $ baba good place for mm to catch up in the next few days"". The word ""vips"" isn't familiar to me, but maybe it's an abbreviation or a typo. ""Baba"" could be related to a stock symbol, possibly KMB. If it's about catching up with another company (maybe MM), that might indicate a strategy move towards growth stocks. But I'm not sure how significant this is for the overall market.

I think I need to assess each tweet as positive, negative, or neutral based on their content and context. The first tweet could be a notice of changes in filings, which might affect stock prices but isn't specific enough to determine polarity without knowing if it's good or bad news. 

The second tweet is more about trading strategies with ""vips"" and mentions ""catching up,"" which suggests potential investment decisions by investors. That could indicate some optimism about growth stocks but doesn't directly relate to the broader market performance.

So, combining these two tweets: The first might be a minor update or notice, while the second talks about trading positions with a focus on growth stocks. Maybe they're positive because KMB is seen as a growth company, which can boost the stock price. Alternatively, if ""vips"" refers to negative factors like management changes, it could be negative.

Since I don't have complete information, I might lean towards positive based on the mention of growth stocks but could also consider neutral if there's some uncertainty or lack of clarity about the tweets' contents."
2014-12-25,Missing,File not found
2014-12-26,Negative,"Alright, I need to determine whether these tweets will positively affect, negatively impact, or have no significant effect on the stock price of ""baba"". Let me break down each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""$ baba chart URL via URL breaking the cloud today but not much strength imo."" It mentions a chart and talks about whether there's any strength. The word ""chart"" might indicate that investors are monitoring the stock's price movements visually, which is common in some markets. However, it doesn't specify if it's bullish or bearish. Since it's about visualization and uncertainty, it's probably neutral.

Now, the second tweet: ""AT_USER i'm still in calls . but $ baba short term down tgt is $ 105 or bullish momo takes to $ 110 . not sure yet."" This seems more technical. It mentions the stock being below a target price of $105 and suggests potential reversal or bullish momentum as it approaches $110. The user's username ""AT_USER"" might indicate a broader market trend, but without specific information on investor sentiment, it's hard to gauge the exact impact. However, there is an implied expectation that if bulls take off the support at $110, they could see positive news.

Putting both together: The first tweet introduces uncertainty about the stock's strength, which doesn't give a clear direction. The second suggests that bulls might push the price up to $110, but without knowing how the broader market is doing or the sentiment of individual investors, it's ambiguous. It leans towards potential positive impact due to the outlook but isn't certain."
2014-12-27,Negative,"Alright, so I'm looking at these tweets about stocks and trying to figure out their impact on the stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock for each tweet. The symbols are often at the end of some words. For example, ""apple"" is $aapl, ""baba"" is $t baba, and so on. So I should extract those from each line.

Next, I have to separate positive and negative factors in each tweet. Factors might include things like stock performance, company announcements, earnings reports, etc. Each tweet seems to be either positive or negative regarding specific stocks.

I also need to assess the sentiment of each tweet. Sentiment could be based on whether the tweet is talking about good news (positive) or bad news (negative). I'll have to look for keywords like ""trades,"" ""news,"" ""report,"" and see if they're optimistic or pessimistic.

Looking at the tweets, most are repeating either positive or negative reports from stock analysts. For example, a tweet saying ""top stock analyst releases report"" is definitely negative. Others might mention specific stocks like ""baba,"" which could indicate their potential performance.

Some tweets repeat the same information, like multiple mentions of $baba in different tweets. This repetition makes me think there's consistent news about it, so it likely affects the overall sentiment negatively because people are invested in it.

Other tweets talk about upcoming IPOs or market trends, but they seem neutral because they're just adding context without a major shift in opinion. For example, ""alibaba took down 90 million fake products ahead of its ipo"" is not a huge news, so the sentiment isn't too positive or negative.

Putting it all together: most tweets are either very strong and consistent reports (negative) or repeating trends that don't change much (neutral). There's also some consistency in the same stocks being discussed. This could create a sustained downward pressure on the stock price, making the overall sentiment Negative."
2014-12-28,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the given company. The user has provided six tweets, and each one is about a top stock like AT_USER or Apple (AAPL), BABA (Business Applications Inc.), etc.

First, let's look at the structure. Each tweet starts with ""rt AT_USER"" followed by a long list of stocks and some URL mentions. I'm assuming all these are positive statements without specific negative information.

The first three tweets are very similar: multiple reports on top stocks for 2015. These are likely from stock analysts and could be reinforcing that these stocks are performing well in 2015, which is a good sign for the company's future performance. Positive sentiment here seems strong.

Then there are two more tweets starting with ""rt AT_USER"". The fourth one mentions a war between its 50th DMA and a lagging R/S line. It says they still give the long side the benefit of the doubt, which might be indicating that the company isn't as favored by many investors, possibly due to some political or economic factors. This could suggest uncertainty but not necessarily a clear negative impact yet.

The fifth tweet is similar to the first three again: more reports on top stocks for 2015. It doesn't seem to add much new information beyond what was already covered in the previous tweets.

The sixth tweet also repeats positive statements about market options and specific companies. Again, no negative content or analysis here.

Putting it all together, most of the tweets are reinforcing recent financial reports, which are often seen as positive indicators for a company's upcoming performance. The mention of potential political tensions is less likely to significantly impact the stock price unless it affects investor confidence, but that doesn't seem like a dominant factor in this context.

Therefore, the overall sentiment is probably positive because most tweets are focused on confirming recent market reports and supporting ongoing financial health."
2014-12-29,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the company. First, I need to identify each tweet and extract the relevant information.

Looking at each tweet, I see several mentions of analysts giving reports or updates on their stocks. For example, some tweets talk about the initial public offering of a stock, others mention specific companies like BABA or other indices. 

One tweet talks about an analyst report mentioning $ XLE for 2015 and names of stocks like GOOG, AMZN, etc., which might be related to tech stocks. Another mentions an initial offering and real-time trading alerts.

I notice that several tweets are just repeating the same information or similar reports from the same sources. This repetition could indicate a steady stream of updates about the company's developments. 

Since the user is asking for a single-line conclusion, I need to summarize the overall sentiment based on these repeated updates. All the mentions are about stock options and the potential of companies in the tech sector. These factors might make investors more cautious or confident, affecting their stock price outlook.

Given that there isn't strong positive news like earnings reports or favorable news from major sources, it seems the company's prospects aren't improving rapidly. So, despite some investment calls, the overall sentiment might be neutral."
2014-12-30,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a given company. The user provided a set of 15 tweets. Let me go through them step by step.

First, looking at tweet number 1: It's an analyst report mentioning top stocks for 2015 with specific stock names. I see it mentions Aplyx (Aapl), Amazon (Amzn), BABA (Baba), and others. This seems like positive information because it gives investors a clear outlook.

Tweets 2-4 are similar, all about the same report but repeated. They all mention top stocks for 2015, so this is consistent and supportive.

Tweets 5-7 mention something about $YHOO's stake in BABA being worthless because people called them unreliable or Chinese. This seems like a negative point because it affects investor sentiment negatively.

Tweets 8-14 are again about the analyst report but have some specific stock names, which is positive information.

Then there are tweets with links and other topics, like ""zynga's shareholders wait for gain is ending."" However, I don't see any mentions of a specific company here. It seems neutral because it's speculative without context on the company.

So overall, most tweets are either supportive (tweets 1-7), negative due to YHOO's stake issue (tweets 5-7), and then some support (tweets 8-14). Since there are both positive and negative points about the same report, it's probably a mix. However, given that YHOO is involved negatively, which could be a major point affecting investor sentiment, I'm leaning towards Negative overall."
2014-12-31,Positive,"Okay, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. I'm looking at the given tweets and trying to extract relevant information step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Scanning through them, it seems like some mentions include ""aapl,"" which is Apple Inc., so that's probably the stock we're focusing on.

Next, for each tweet, I'll break down the factors. It looks like some tweets are positive and others negative. For example, a tweet about Apple increasing analyst reports would be a positive factor if it shows positive news about the company. Similarly, negative factors might mention declines in performance or other issues.

I'll go through each tweet one by one:

1. The first tweet talks about an analyst report on top stocks for 2015. It mentions several companies but doesn't provide specific details on any of them. I'll assume it's a general positive note.
   
2. The second tweet says Google outperforms Apple and points to T, BABA, YHOO hitting 35 and 300. So, BABA is mentioned as having hit 300, which could be a strong positive sign for Apple.

3. Third tweet again about top stocks for 2015, but mentions ECIG, which I'm not familiar with; it might be a typo or misinterpretation.

4. Fourth tweet is another report on stock options. No specific performance mentioned here.

5. Fifth tweet is similar to the first one, just repeating information without specifics.

6. Sixth tweet again about Google outperforming Apple and mentions BABA at 300. So, that's reinforcing the positive from the second tweet.

7. Seventh tweet talks about a report on top stocks but adds a link to Snapchat sharing New Year's Eve events. This could be a positive or neutral note depending on context.

8. Eighth tweet is about a watchlist for TSLA, BABA, FB, TWTR, LCO, GPRO. It doesn't mention any performance.

9. Ninth and tenth tweets are repeats of the first two tweets with different mentions, so I'll take them as reinforcing similar points.

10. Eleventh tweet is about a Twitter Finance award for $BABA Bonanza Day on November 2nd, which could be a promotional or positive note.

11. Twelfth tweet just says YHOO is shackled to BABA. This could mean that YHOO's performance isn't as strong as BABA might indicate.

13. Twelfth again mentions $THX Bonanza Day for BABA.

Wait, I need to make sure I'm not mixing up links. Let me check:

- The twelfth tweet: $ yhoo still shackled to $ baba

And then in the list, after 8, there's a 12th line with ""my wk 11/10 watchlist ... $ baba , $ t , $ fb , $ twtr , $ lco , $ gpro""

Wait, perhaps it's two separate tweets? Or maybe a typo. I think it might be that the twelfth tweet is about YHOO being shackled to BABA.

Then after 12, there are tweets from 13 and 14 about analyst reports on top stocks, with mentions of ECIG which I don't recognize. Then in 15-17, more report tweets without specific details.

So, putting it all together:

Positive factors include Apple's stock increasing for 2015 (probably strong), YHOO hitting a high for $300, and BABA being mentioned multiple times with positive numbers like 35 and 300. The twelfth tweet about YHOO being shackled to BABA could indicate that BABA is the top performer, which might have implications on Apple.

Neutral factors are minimal here; all tweets seem focused on reporting or market movements without major shifts in sentiment.

Negative factors: Not sure yet, but since most mentions are positive, maybe none are clearly negative. But I should check for any mentions of declines or negative news related to Apple.

Wait, in the twelfth tweet, it says YHOO is shackled to BABA, which could mean that if YHOO improves, BABA might follow. That's a possible neutral factor because it introduces a potential positive correlation without direct mention of performance.

Additionally, tweets 10-17 are about analyst reports on stock options but don't specify if Apple's stock has gone up or down in the past four years (though none of them have been), which might be considered as a long-term perspective and thus not directly impacting short-term sentiment.

So, overall, the positive factors include strong BABA performance, YHOO hitting a high, and the analyst reports about 2015. The negative factors are minimal. The neutral factor is the twelfth tweet suggesting potential correlation between YHOO and BABA performance without specific mention of either's current status.

Therefore, the overall sentiment should be positive because the main indicators point towards strong movements in Apple's stock."
2015-01-01,Negative,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company based on the given information. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at tweet 1: It mentions the top five internet stocks and their prices. This seems like it's providing specific data points but doesn't mention sentiment or analysis. Maybe it's just setting up context without influencing investor decisions.

Next, tweets 2 to 5 all talk about a report from analysts on stock market options for 2015. That suggests the company is being analyzed in depth. However, since I don't have specific information about any positive or negative outcomes of these reports, it's hard to tell if this affects their performance.

Tweets 6 and 7 again focus on analyst reports but with no mentions of any specific stocks or predictions. It seems like these could be part of a larger narrative that doesn’t directly relate to the stock in question.

Tweets 8 and 9 mention a large-scale IPO, where BABA's share price is mentioned as potentially increasing by $25 billion. I know BABA has gone through several IPOs, including the $10B one last year, so this could indicate potential growth but doesn't specify whether it's positive or negative for the stock itself.

Tweets 10 and 14 are similar to tweet 9, again discussing the possibility of an IPO. No direct information about whether this would be a good or bad move for BABA, just a prediction.

Tweets 12 is another mention of an IPO but doesn't provide any specific analysis on how it would affect BABA's stock price. It might not be enough to tip the scales in their favor or against.

Finally, tweet 13 repeats the top analyst report again without new information. So, all these tweets are consolidating predictions about potential IPOs for BABA, which could influence investor sentiment but don't provide concrete evidence of any positive or negative impact on their stock price.

Putting it all together, none of these tweets offer specific data points or analysis that would directly indicate whether BABA's stock is going up, down, or staying the same. They're all about future predictions without any measurable outcomes."
2015-01-02,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and figure out if they're positive, negative, or neutral towards the company's future stock price. Let me take it step by step.

First, looking at each tweet individually might be a bit overwhelming because there are ten of them. But maybe some patterns can emerge. The target stock seems to be either Aapl, Amzn, Baba, or ebay, depending on which symbol is extracted from the tweets. 

Looking at the first few tweets, I see mentions like $ aapl $ amzn and $ baba, etc. That suggests that the target stock is probably one of these four companies: Apple, Amazon, Beta, or Facebook.

Now, each tweet starts with ""rt AT_USER"" which probably means it's an analyst report or some update from someone. Let me look for mentions of "" analysts,"" ""top stocks,"" or any positive or negative words in the tweets.

Looking at tweet 1: It talks about top stock market options for 2015 and reports prices for aapl, amzn, baba, ebay. There's no mention of the company, just the symbols. So maybe it's not directly targeting a specific company but is an update on multiple stocks in general.

Similarly, tweet 2 mentions several companies again without any target stock name.

For tweets like 3: ""shorted $ baba with stop at high of day ."" This uses the word ""shorted,"" which suggests that this particular stock (BABA) has been sold short. But it's not clear if this is favorable or unfavorable for the company's stock price.

Tweets 4 and 5 are similar, just repeating information about BABA. Then tweet 7 also mentions BABA but isn't too positive either. 

Looking further: tweets 8 mention multiple companies again without a target. Tweets 9 talks about Wall Street banks and shorting BABA with a technical setup idea. This seems like a hedge or shorting strategy, which could be seen as a way to reduce risk.

Tweets 10 is similar to tweet 9 but mentions Aapl instead of BABA. So again, focusing on shorting another stock.

Now, looking for any positive language: There are no words that suggest good news or favorable actions. Most tweets just report prices and offer information without sentiment indicators like ""Buy,"" ""Sell,"" or ""Invest.""

Sentiment analysis is tricky here because all the updates seem neutral towards specific stocks but mention strategies rather than market reactions. The only mentions of actual performance data (prices) are neutral.

So, putting it together: All the tweets are providing general market information about several companies without indicating any specific positive or negative impact on the stock price. They're more like news articles that could influence future prices by signaling potential actions from analysts or traders."
2015-01-03,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for zynga. 

First, looking at the first tweet: ""zynga's shareholders wait for gain is ending URL AT_USER $ znga $ fb $ msft $ baba AT_USER"". Hmm, it seems like a link is being followed by some stock symbols. I'm not entirely sure what this means. Maybe it's about a sale or acquisition? Or perhaps the user is holding shares of zynga and expects more information. 

Next, the second tweet: ""$ cure candlesticks $ cure most recent stock chart and technical analysis . $ splv $ ebay $ sltd $ baba $ gold $ efa ht URL"". This one also includes several symbols. ""Candlesticks"" often refers to candle charts, which show price trends. ""Technical analysis"" could mean charts that have been analyzed for patterns. The presence of multiple stock names like SPLV, EBAY, SLTD, BABA, and others makes me think about the broader market context. It might be related to news or events affecting the company.

So combining these two tweets, it seems they're monitoring zynga's performance with technical indicators. They might be suggesting that investors are expecting a certain stock price based on recent trading patterns. If positive factors lead to favorable news, like increased demand or earnings, this could drive up the price. Conversely, if there are negative indicators, such as lower prices or warnings about the company's health, it might push the stock down.

I don't see any clear positive indicators here. The links and symbols seem more about market activity than actual performance data. Therefore, I'm leaning towards a neutral impact because both tweets don't provide strong evidence of upward movement."
2015-01-04,Missing,File not found
2015-01-05,Neutral,"Okay, I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company based on the provided information. Let's go through each tweet one by one.

First, the target stock symbol is 'baba'. I don't have real-time data for this specific stock, but I'll consider factors like market trends and company fundamentals.

Looking at the first tweet: It mentions a stock contest with $baba and a free tablet. The user is offering to win this contest. While it's a fun activity, it seems more of an entertainment aspect rather than an investment strategy or positive news for the stock itself. So, not sure about its impact yet.

Second tweet: This one includes 'usd', 'mnst', etc., which I think stands for money supply indicators like M1 and M2. The word ""sentiquant"" appears in it, but I'm not familiar with what that stands for. Maybe an acronym? Perhaps related to financial data or a metric used by the company. Without context, it's hard to assess.

Third tweet: This seems to be about a trade idea involving $tno and mentions 'tino swing'. The stock is up 45% so far. Again, this looks like a performance boost rather than any positive news about the company or its stock. It might not directly affect the stock price but shows strength.

Fourth tweet: Relates to the market on Monday, January 5, 2015 at 10:03 AM. The user is posting financial data and some metrics related to stocks like 'nke', 'fxi', etc., from $baba. It's discussing recent news but doesn't present a clear positive or negative outlook.

Putting it all together, the tweets are focused on entertainment, money supply indicators, market trends, and past events. There's no significant positive information about the company or its stock price movement. The user seems to be engaging in various topics rather than providing any concrete data that would sway the stock price.

Therefore, I'm leaning towards a [Neutral] sentiment because the tweets don't provide any substantial information that could indicate whether the stock is going up, down, or stable."
2015-01-06,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user has provided three tweets and wants me to analyze their likely impact on a company's stock price using positive, neutral, or negative. 

First, I need to extract the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""of the 5 earnings-busting stocks touted as holding above key support level URL 3 closed below it tue . $ grub $ cybk $ baba"". Hmm, this one mentions ""grub"" which is a chemical company, so maybe the target stock is Grubbi. But I'm not entirely sure because the other tweets have different names.

The second tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ googl $ goog $ fb $ yhoo精油 tabling options الداو_جونز $ baba 103 call 9jan op : 98cent مستشارك_المالي URL"". This seems to focus on Google, Facebook, Y hat, etc. It mentions a ""plexing options"" which could be investment vehicles, and it's related to Monday trading. So the target stock here is likely Google.

The third tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ baba could be good for $ 106 before turning bearish again . URL"". This mentions BABA and talks about potential gains but doesn't specify a target stock clearly.

Now, I need to analyze each tweet's factors and sentiment. 

For the Grubbi tweet, it's talking about earnings, chemical stocks, so positive signals about company performance. It says ""held above key support level"" which could be indicating good news or future prospects. The fact that URL 3 is closed below it might suggest investor attention, but not sure if that's a factor.

In the Google tweet, they're discussing investment options and trading. They mention options and plexing, which are related to stock trading strategies rather than specific stocks. This shows interest in the market but doesn't directly address a specific stock.

The BABA tweet is more about expectations for gains, suggesting that BABA might be performing well, but it's vague on what target stock they're referring to.

Considering each tweet individually:

1. Grubbi: Positive factors like earnings and chemical stocks could indicate good developments, so this seems positive.
2. Google: They're talking about investment options and trading strategies, which is a market trend, not specific to any stock yet. Not directly indicating sentiment on a particular stock.
3. BABA: Positive expectations for gains but no target stock identified.

Since each tweet doesn't specify the exact target stock clearly, it's challenging to determine the overall impact. However, Grubbi and BABA are more focused on positive aspects of specific companies or market trends that might influence investor sentiment toward a particular stock. Google is more about market dynamics. Without knowing the exact stock, I can only make educated guesses based on general market indicators.

Given that two tweets mention specific stocks (Grubbi and BABA) with potential positive factors, it leans towards an overall positive sentiment for those companies."
2015-01-07,Positive,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price of BABA. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually.

The first tweet says ""fast money pick . should be up tomorrow . tim : stevelwr 1 URL."" It seems like it's promising news for BABA, suggesting that the stock is expected to go up. So, I'm leaning towards a positive sentiment here.

The second tweet mentions something about a penny stock and talks about ""big things coming,"" which might indicate potential growth or improvement in the company's performance. That also sounds like a good sign, so another positive vote.

Now, the third tweet is from claytrader and just has some text: ""* * $ baba video chart 01-06- 15 * * URL."" This one doesn't have any specific information about the stock price or performance. It seems like it's showing a video or chart but not providing detailed analysis. Since it's vague, I can't make an informed judgment here.

Putting this together, two tweets are positive, and one is neutral with vague info. That should tip towards a positive overall sentiment for BABA."
2015-01-08,Positive,"Okay, I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company based on their labels [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet says ""$ baba breakout - next target 107 URL."" That sounds like a positive message because it mentions a potential breakthrough and is an update on targeting. It's looking promising, so I'll mark this as Positive.

2. The second tweet mentions $ aapl $ baba $ halava $ lulu $ fold $ pir $ amzn $ Cree $ fb. It's talking about stocks, specifically mentioning alibaba and ytesla. There's no specific positive or negative action here, just listing multiple stock names. Without more details, it's hard to assess the sentiment directly, but I might consider it Neutral because it could be a mix of views without clear direction.

3. The third tweet lists $ aapl $ baba $ halo $ lulu $ fold $ pir $ amzn $ Cree $ fb again, similar to the second tweet. It seems like just more stock names, so again, without specifics on sentiment or effect, I'll mark this as Neutral.

4. The fourth tweet warns about $ yhoo $ baba of alibaba's riches being with shareholders, citing marissa mayer. This is a negative statement because it highlights potential issues or risks for the company. So, I'll classify this as Negative.

5. The fifth tweet talks about ""fous 4 dvd is the best daytrading dvd."" It mentions watching stock prices on $ jdst $ baba and other unrelated stocks. There's no clear positive or negative action here either, just a recommendation to watch certain stock symbols. So, this tweet seems Neutral.

Now, let me summarize the sentiments:

1. Positive
2. Neutral
3. Neutral
4. Negative
5. Neutral

To find the overall sentiment, I should consider how each tweet contributes. The first tweet is positive, but then there are several neutral and negative tweets in between. Since one tweet is significantly positive (the first) and others are mostly neutral or slightly negative, it's hard to determine a clear overall trend without more context on when these tweets were sent relative to the company's stock performance.

However, given that one of them is strongly positive and the rest are neutral or mixed, I might lean towards [Neutral] as the overall sentiment because there isn't a dominant positive or negative trend. But it's worth noting that the initial tweet could set off some investor interest, but without more data on how those actions correlate with actual stock movements, I can't be entirely sure.

Wait, the second and third tweets are about multiple stocks, so they might indicate that the company is doing well across several sectors or products. That could lead to a general positive outlook, which might suggest the overall sentiment is Positive despite some negative tweets in between.

But the fourth tweet directly mentions alibaba's troubles, which seems more impactful as a negative statement. I'm torn here because one tweet is strong positive, and others are neutral or mixed. Maybe the dominant factor is the initial positive tweet, so I'll go with [Positive]."
2015-01-09,Negative,"Okay, so I need to determine the impact on the stock price based on these tweets. Let's take it step by step.

First, looking at each tweet:

1. The user is posting a list of stocks with various symbols and mentions some factors like ""dollar-cost avg their last yoku buy"" which seems negative about investing in YOKU. That might imply some concern or dislike for certain investments.

2. They're talking about wanting more content in China, but the mention of $30 sounds like a specific target price for something else. It's vague and could be interpreted as positive, maybe expecting a price increase due to the focus on China.

3. The user is subscribing to several tech stocks. This seems promotional without clear indication of good or bad news. Could be neutral because it's about promoting current investments rather than new ones.

4. They bought back bull put spread for $8 loss. That sounds like a significant short position, which could indicate concern about the company's future value. Maybe negative sentiment as they're concerned about the stock price going down.

5. They notice leading growth stocks and check their prices on those specific stocks. This is positive because it suggests investors are paying attention to these stocks, but without specifics on how they impact the main stock, it's hard to assess directly.

Now, for each tweet, I'll consider if there's a positive or negative factor. The first tweet has negative factors about investing in YOKU, which could be negative. The second is vague but mentions a target price, which might lean towards positive. The third is promotional without issues. The fourth is about short positions, which is definitely negative. The fifth is about monitoring growth stocks.

But I need to look for a clear trend. The fourth tweet's significant loss suggests concern and possible negative sentiment towards the main stock. The second tweet's target price could also be positive but vague. However, when combining all factors, including the user buying back stocks might not directly affect the overall impact on the main stock.

So, considering the most significant factor is the buyback of a bull put spread, which indicates concern and possible negative sentiment towards the main stock."
2015-01-10,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the future stock price of DanROCKS. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at each tweet individually and extract the relevant symbols or factors mentioned. 

Looking at the first tweet: ""danrocks : $ san on radar $ ery $ baba $ skf $ qcom $ aal URL"". Hmm, this seems to be a mix of different stocks listed as $ san, $ ery, etc., along with some keywords like ""radar"", ""baba"", ""skf"", and ""qaq."" Since it's just listing multiple stocks without any positive or negative language, I'm not sure if these represent an investment strategy or just a random selection. It might be considered neutral because there's no clear indication of favoriting or disfavoring the stock.

Now, considering all the tweets together, they all mention different stocks and some keywords but don't present them in a way that suggests improvement or decline for DanROCKS. They're just listing prices and names, so overall, it doesn't seem to have any positive or negative influence on the stock price."
2015-01-11,Positive,"Alright, I need to figure out how to determine the impact on the stock price of the given company based on the provided tweets. The user has given me four tweets and an output requirement for just one line deciding if it's positive, neutral, or negative.

First, looking at the target stock symbol from the tweets: bq. There are multiple words like spy, qqq, iwm, baba, aapl, nflx, tsla, xlf, ibb. Hmm, that doesn't seem to make sense for a single stock. Maybe there's a typo or something missing. Let me check again. Wait, spy is a well-known tech stock, but the other symbols like iwm, baba, etc., don't match my knowledge of major ETFs and stocks. Perhaps bq stands for something else entirely? I'll have to assume that ""bq"" might be a typo or represent a specific ETF related to bq stock.

Next, looking at the tweets:

1. ""my video URL stock mkt analysis wk ending 1/9 / 15 $ spy $ qqq $ iwm $ baba $ aapl $ nflx $ tsla $ xlf $ ibb""

This tweet mentions various ETFs like spy, qqq, etc., and talks about a market analysis week ending on January 9th. It doesn't mention specific actions or investment decisions.

2. ""rt AT_USER alibaba set to invest about $575 million in indian online-shopping service , paytm . URL $ baba""

This tweet seems to suggest that Alibaba, a major tech company, is investing around $575 million into an Indian online shopping service via Paytm and the URL mentioned. The presence of ""baba"" (Alibaba's ETF) makes me think this could be related to bq stock if bq stands for Alibaba.

3. Same as tweet 2: ""rt AT_USER alibaba set to invest about $575 million in indian online-shopping service , paytm . URL $ baba""

Again, similar structure and investment decision pointing towards bq stock.

4. ""$ gpro $ baba $ amzn $ googl trading pivots - how to know when price will drop or pop before the open - 30 min charts . URL""

This tweet talks about GPRO stock and mentions Google's (GOOGL) and Amazon's (AMZN) price action, including pivot points and potential price changes in 30-minute chart intervals.

Now, considering the overall sentiment:

- The tweets are all from Alibaba investing money into an Indian online service. This is a positive signal that the company might be expanding their market presence or enhancing their offerings within India.
- Investors typically look at how companies perform relative to the broader market. If a company like bq (assuming it's Alibaba) is showing strong growth in its ETFs and if Alibaba is a major player, this could indicate positive sentiment as investors may perceive it positively.

However, while there are several positive tweets about investments, they don't mention any overt actions that might affect the stock price. The lack of specific details about their performance relative to competitors or overall market conditions makes it hard to assess a direct impact. However, given that this is Alibaba's investment in an Indian service, which could potentially attract more customers and boost growth, this suggests a positive outlook.

Thus, even though not all tweets are explicitly about the stock price movement, the context and the nature of the information provided (investments) lean towards positive sentiment for the company."
2015-01-12,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of the given company. Let me start by breaking down each tweet.

First tweet is ""movie production from alibaba group holding ltd $ baba URL alibaba."" It looks like a link or maybe related to a news about BABA stock. The word ""movie"" could be part of an investment tip, so I'm not sure if it's positive or negative. 

Second tweet says RT user sees a long setup in BABA and needs a breakout. This sounds like a call for action, which is generally positive because it signals investor interest. A ""breakout"" often means the stock will rise above certain levels.

Third tweet mentions $ baba lower lows. That seems negative because it indicates a decline or lack of recent gains, suggesting potential downward pressure on the stock price.

Fourth tweet lists multiple stocks like IBD, BITARX, RAX, etc., all referred to as top stocks. This is quite broad and doesn't specify anything positive about BABA, so I'm leaning towards neutral because it's a general statement without specific information.

Fifth tweet talks about the week starting with healthcare deals on Wall Street. Healthcare is often a strong indicator of positive economic trends, which can boost stock prices. This could be positive sentiment.

Now, combining these thoughts: The second and fifth tweets are positive calls for action or outlook on the market, while the third is negative and the first and fourth are neutral or generic.

So overall, the positive tweets (2 and 5) push investor confidence, but there's some negativity from 3. However, considering that the company isn't mentioned in the negatives, maybe it's just a general stock on Wall Street with no specific info about BABA. So perhaps the overall sentiment is neutral because while investors are encouraged to act, without concrete information, it doesn't strongly tip the balance."
2015-01-13,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on BABA's stock price based on the given information. Let me start by breaking down what each tweet says.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""for that price of $ baba are being traded at twice the rate of shares of $ yhoo today ."" Hmm, this seems a bit confusing. It mentions BABA and YOO (which I think is YHOO). The sentence doesn't seem to provide much context or specific data about the stock prices. It just says that BABA's price is being traded at twice YOO's rate today. Without actual numbers, it's hard to assess if this affects sentiment.

Now, the second tweet: ""rt $ qqq algos triggered buy in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 08:41 p / t 102.80 $ goog $ fb $ amzn $ baba $ tsla $ nflx $ gpro $ aapl $ tqqq hft"" This looks like it's related to trading volumes and algorithms. It mentions ""algos triggered buy in several sites,"" which could indicate increased buying activity. The prices listed are some of the stocks mentioned, but again, without specific market positions or trends, it's hard to gauge sentiment.

Both tweets mention stock symbols (BABA, YOO) and related topics like algorithms, trading volumes, etc. The first one talks about price comparison, the second is about algorithm-related buying activity across multiple companies. I don't see any positive or negative keywords here that would suggest a trend in stock prices.

Since neither tweet provides specific information about BABA's performance relative to others or any positive/neutral/negative trends related to its stock price, it seems like there's no clear indication of how these tweets will affect the company's future stock price. They might be providing context about other stocks and trading activities but not enough to determine the stock's direction.

Therefore, I think the overall sentiment is neutral because neither tweet offers any definitive information that could push the stock up or down."
2015-01-14,Neutral,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company based on the given tweets. Let's go through each tweet one by one and see what information they're conveying.

First, I need to determine the target stock from the tweets. The words like ""baba"" appear multiple times in some tweets, so that might be the stock symbol we should focus on: BABA.

Now, let's look at each tweet:

1. ""alibaba will help curb export of recalled items URL $ baba china"" - This seems to mention Alibaba helping with recalls and discussing BABA's valuation. It looks like they're looking to support or evaluate BABA stock.

2. ""$ jnug getting interesting $ ibb $ soxs $ bita $ xli $ baba URL"" - This tweet is quite vague, using slang words like ""jnug,"" ""soxs,"" and ""bita."" Not enough context to determine sentiment, but mentions of BABA's valuation.

3. ""URL issues daily trading alerts , step by step trading plan for $ aapl $ gild $ bidu $ nflx $ baba $ gpro $ tsla $ feye $ fb $ celg"" - This tweet is listing other stocks to trade with BABA, which might indicate support but not sure about sentiment.

4. ""rt AT_USER uber's rival in china kuaidi to get more than $ 2 billion valuation from $ baba , softbank , tiger global in new round"" - This seems like a news event where BABA is valued highly by two large firms, which could be positive news for investors.

5. ""rt AT_USER $ baba under $ 100 in early trading . potential s / t support at 98 , then 88 . potential resistance @ 104 . ( 60 - min chart ) ."" - This is a technical analysis tweet about stock price trends, showing possible support and resistance levels. It's predicting the stock might rise but isn't providing direct valuation info.

6. ""brooklyn's AT_USER crafts public offering , putting nyctech back on the map URL via AT_USER $ gs $ ms $ amzn $ baba"" - BABA is part of Amzn, so this suggests Amzn is expanding and they're back into the game. Not sure about sentiment but positive for the market.

7. ""although $ baba is in full on bear mode , i think today's candle is very attractive for future longs . waiting for confirmation . AT_USER"" - This is a cautious tweet, talking about BABA being in bearish news but indicating potential for gains later. Not sure about sentiment yet.

8. ""$ teo stock price updated wednesday , january 14 , 2015 4:11 : 28 pm $ cvs $ baba $ soxl $ nugt"" - BABA's price is mentioned, but no context or sentiment. It's just the stock value update.

9. ""AT_USER cnbc was all $ baba all the time for a week or two"" - This means that CNBC prices are tied to BABA, which suggests support from another company. Not sure about sentiment.

So summarizing each tweet:

1. Support or analysis on recall and valuation.
2. Vague but mentions valuation.
3. Trading advice with other stocks.
4. High valuation news for BABA.
5. Technical analysis of potential price movement.
6. Amzn expansion indicating BABA's position in the game.
7. Cautious but optimistic outlook about future trading.
8. Stock value update without sentiment.
9. Support from CNBC pricing tied to BABA.

Overall, the tweets are providing information about BABA's valuation, related news events, and its position in the market. There isn't enough context for a clear overall sentiment yet. But some mentions of high valuations and positive outlooks suggest potential positive impact.

I'm leaning towards a positive sentiment because there's talk about valuations being higher and BABA possibly expanding into other sectors like Amzn. However, given tweet 4 which is highly speculative with direct mentions of softbank and tiger global, that could be a red flag for negative sentiment if the information is not reliable."
2015-01-15,Neutral,"Okay, let me try to figure out the likely impact on the stock price of the company based on these tweets. Hmm, so first I need to look at each tweet individually and see what they're saying.

The first tweet says: ""w / wishlist ready i reenterd market w / dow - 300pts today . bought 12 : $ dis $ baba $ blk $ ba $ goog $ ulta $ tsla $ gs $ fb $ f $ nke $ aal AT_USER."" Alright, so the user is at Dow, which I think means they're in the Dow Jones or something similar. They have a wishlist and are reentering the market, buying stocks worth 12 points today. The words like ""dis,"" ""baba,"" etc., probably refer to stock symbols or companies.

The second tweet: ""round numbers are battlegrounds : URL … "" a detailed look at how some names have acted at the par number "" $ avgo $ nsc $ baba."" This seems to be talking about round numbers being crucial in determining stock prices. The user is looking into how certain company names behave around specific points called par numbers.

The third tweet: ""what do the ceos of $ ea , $ gild $ baba $ ua $ tsla all have in common ? URL sydsceos"" This one is talking about the CEOs of companies with stock symbols ea, gild, baba, ua, and tsla. They're looking at a blog called Sydsceos.

Now, putting it together, these tweets are all about financial indicators or trends affecting stock prices. The first tweet is about actioning in the market, buying specific stocks. The second is discussing the importance of round numbers. The third is about looking into CEOs' information and a specific blog. 

These seem to be moving pieces in the market. Companies like baba, blk, gooogle (GOOG), etc., are being discussed. Also, mentions of par points and round numbers can influence market sentiment. The CEO discussions might show that some companies are getting media attention or investors are focusing on their leadership.

Since these tweets are likely about internal events affecting stock prices rather than positive news, they probably don't have a significant impact on the overall market. They're more like internal updates or analyzing company performance data."
2015-01-16,Negative,"Okay, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of QCOMQ (I'm assuming it's ""qqq"" because the first tweet mentions trading at 100.49). 

First, I need to go through each tweet one by one. Each tweet has a stock name and some metrics or mentions. My goal is to assess whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative in terms of their impact on the stock price.

Starting with tweet 1: It talks about QQQ trading at $100.49, mentions several cryptocurrencies like goog, fb, amzn, etc., and states a P / T of 98.00. The word ""p/t"" might mean price-to-tangible value ratio? Not sure, but it's probably just a number here. No obvious positive or negative message there.

Tweet 2: It lists more stocks likecelg, cmg, fb, feye, fslr, etc., and mentions gild, gld, gmcr, goog, googl, gs, iwm, jpm, ko, lnkd, lvs, ma. Again, a list of stocks but no explicit positive or negative statements.

Tweet 3: Similar to tweet 1, mentions more cryptocurrencies with P / T of 98.00. Doesn't seem positive.

Tweet 4: This one has "" phenomenal stock trade alerts URL."" It seems like there's an alert about a stock trade and goes to a website, but it doesn't mention the stock price or any positive or negative information. Maybe just a notification?

Tweet 5: Discusses futures dropping on the open but mentions China's higher than usual on the open? Could indicate market volatility, which might lead people to be more cautious about QQQ. Sometimes stocks react to news after trading.

Tweet 6: Again, lists several stocks with metrics but nothing positive or negative mentioned. Not much of an impact here.

Tweet 7: Talks about BABA making a double small trade, saying it's ""bored"" and no further info. Maybe some excitement? But not clear on the impact.

Tweet 8: Says BABA is below $100 and asks what factors are driving its downfall with a link to AT_USER. It seems like they're questioning why the stock has dipped but no indication of positive news affecting it.

Tweet 9: Similar to tweet 6, lists several stocks with metrics but nothing positive or negative mentioned. Just more noise from BABA.

After going through each tweet, I can see that most of them are either just listing a few stocks (tweets 1-3 and 4-8), providing information about the stock without any explicit messages (tweets 2 and 7), or mentioning something unusual like price changes on the market (tweet 5). There's no clear positive or negative sentiment expressed. It seems more like a background of related discussions rather than actual information influencing the stock price.

So, considering all these points, none of the tweets are strong enough to significantly impact the stock price. They might be just part of a broader discussion about market trends or investor sentiment."
2015-01-17,Missing,File not found
2015-01-18,Neutral,"Alright, I need to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price of BAGA stock. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually.

The first tweet says: ""top 4 signs the stock is a scam URL stocks trading $ baba $ twtr URL"". Okay, so it's mentioning that they're researching or scanning URLs related to BAGA. I'm not sure what they specifically are doing here. Maybe they're looking for something specific with BAGA? The mention of ""top 4 signs"" suggests some criteria, but without more context, it's hard to tell if this is positive or negative. It seems like they might be conducting some research or action related to BAGA, which could have implications.

The second tweet: ""rt AT_USER stocks from the smb scanner : $ eigi $ gme $ fl $ splk $ baba URL"". This one mentions the ticker symbol AT_USER and lists a few symbols: EGIG, GME, FL, SPLK, and BAGA. The word ""smb"" makes me think of the Sentiment Magnitude Index or something similar. So they're scanning for stocks related to SMB companies. Again, without knowing if these are good or bad, it's hard to judge. But since AT_USER is a common acronym in stock terminology, maybe it's just a way to get information.

Both tweets seem to be related to researching or looking into BAGA and other companies. It doesn't mention anything negative about the company itself or its performance. So, their main focus seems on potential investments rather than the company's financial health."
2015-01-19,Neutral,"Alright, so I have to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me break it down step by step.

First, from the provided tweet: ""finally , msci includes alibaba , baidu in china index ; a-shares next ? URL via AT_USER $ baba $ bidu $ mchi $ ashr""

I need to extract the target stock symbol. The user mentions ""ashr,"" which I recognize as the ASX Symbol for the Hong Kong Stock Exchange Index 600 (ASX 600). So, the company is likely involved with ASX 600.

Next, I'll analyze each relevant tweet. It looks like this is a single tweet that has multiple parts: it says ""finally,"" mentions MSCI and includes Alibaba, Baidu in the Chinese index; ""a-shares next ? URL via AT_USER $ baba $ bidu $ mchi $ ashr."" 

The first part sets up ASX 600, which is a significant stock exchange. The mention of Alibaba and Baidu suggests they are key players in China's market. However, the second part has some issues: ""ashr"" might be a typo or unclear. Maybe it's supposed to be ""asx""? Also, the URL part includes AT_USER, $ baba, $ bidu, etc., which don't seem relevant unless there's more context, but it's hard to tell.

Looking at the analysis steps:
1. Identify the target stock symbol. I'm confident ASX 600 is involved.
2. Separate factors: Positive and Negative. The tweet doesn't explicitly mention anything negative about the stock; it's positive in terms of index inclusion.
3. Assess sentiment. The tweet seems to be promoting the company, especially with Baidu and Alibaba, which are tech companies. It might seem neutral because there's no explicit negative information. However, the ""ashr"" typo could lead me to question if that affects investor perception.

Putting it all together, while the tweet is positive in terms of mentioning key companies in ASX 600, the lack of explicit negative cues and possible typos make it a neutral sentiment."
2015-01-20,Negative,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets regarding their impact on BABA's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. In all four tweets, it seems like ""BABA"" is consistently mentioned. So that's straightforward—BABA is our main focus here.

Next, for each tweet, I have to separate positive and negative factors. Let's take them one by one.

1. The first tweet is ""$ baba hod ! ! !"" At first glance, the text mentions ""baba"" in quotes, which seems like a play on words or perhaps just emphasizing something. It might not add much information about sentiment but could be a bit confusing. I'll note this as neutral since it's unclear what the content conveys.

2. The second tweet is ""china ’ s alibaba makes first for.israeli tech URL via AT_USER israeltech startup nation $ baba."" This seems like a headline promoting a new venture, but without more context, it's hard to tell if there are positive or negative factors here. It could be seen as speculative or not contributing much to the stock price. I'll consider this neutral.

3. The third tweet says ""$ baba oversold, now rebounding."" This clearly communicates that BABA is currently underperforming relative to its historical averages. Oversold stocks typically mean investors are bearish because they might be selling off undervalued assets when it's overvalued. So this tweet adds negative information about the stock.

4. The fourth tweet is ""rt AT_USER new reason appears for yahoo investors to fear alibaba's business structure URL $ yahoy $ baba."" This seems like another promotional text, perhaps highlighting a reason why Yahoo might fear BABA. It again doesn't provide direct financial information but adds context or speculation about the stock.

Putting this all together: The first tweet is neutral with unclear info. The third tweet is negative as it says BABA is oversold and rebounding. The others are speculative and not informative enough to affect sentiment. Therefore, combining the negatives from the third tweet suggests a negative overall sentiment."
2015-01-21,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out how these tweets impact the stock price of Amazon. Let me start by looking at each tweet and breaking down what they're saying.

The first tweet is ""why we need a little amazon right this very minute $ amzn $ baba $ cost $ fdx $ sne $ ups $ wmt URL"". The user mentions Amazon, BABA, FDX, SNE, UPW, WMT. From the words used like ""need,"" ""cost,"" and ""value,"" it seems positive about Amazon's value. The mention of other companies might indicate diversification or confidence in Amazon's future.

The second tweet is similar: ""$ tesla $ astra $ connex $ gro $ mull $ tesla"". This one talks about Tesla, but also mentions connections with companies like CONEX and GRO. It seems positive too, talking about potential growth areas for Amazon if these companies are successful.

Now, to assess each tweet's impact on Amazon: both seem to highlight opportunities or diversification points. They're not negative or just neutral. They add value by pointing out upcoming investments or connections that could benefit Amazon. So overall, combining the positive outlook from both tweets, the sentiment should be positive."
2015-01-22,Neutral,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of APLUS ALGO'S. Let's go through each step methodically.

First, from what I understand, I need to identify the target stock symbol. Looking at the tweets provided, it seems like ""aapl"" is mentioned multiple times. So, the target stock must be Apple Inc., denoted by APLU in case there are other symbols or variations. 

Next, I have to go through each tweet one by one and assess their impact on APLUS ALGO'S stock. Let's start with the first tweet: ""rt $ aapl algos crossed 111 level in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx , p / t 107.50 $ goog $ fb $ amzn $ tsla $ nflx $ bidu $ gpro $ baba $ qqq hft""

Hmm, this tweet seems to be from a user mentioning something about Apple's stock crossing a level related to a platform called ""algos."" It mentions several companies like sigma-x, crossfinder, ats, lx, etc., which are financial instruments or platforms. The price mentioned is $107.50 for APLUS ALGO'S. But the main point seems to be about Apple crossing a level on some stock exchange, but it's unclear what that level refers to—maybe ""sigma-x"" isn't a known symbol here. The term ""p/t 107.50"" might stand for price-to-trend or something similar.

I'm not entirely sure how this relates directly to Apple's stock performance. It seems more like a general financial commentary rather than a direct news event that affects APLUS ALGO'S. Therefore, it's hard to assess the sentiment based on this tweet alone.

Moving on to the second tweet: ""rt $ aapl algos triggered sell in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 13:04 p / t 107.50 $ goog $ bidu $ fb $ amzn $ tsla $ nflx $ gpro $ baba $ qqq hft""

This tweet is similar to the first one but mentions a selling event. It's structured similarly, with some technical terms and market capitalization (mcap) numbers like 13:04 p/t. This time, it says ""triggered sell,"" which makes me think that there was a sell-off or event causing APLUS ALGO'S stock to drop. The specific timeframe is at 13:04 P.M., which could be a significant point in time affecting the price.

However, without knowing the exact cause of the sell-off or the reason it started (like earnings, news about the company), it's difficult to gauge the sentiment entirely. It might have been a market-moving event with significant impact, but unless there's more context, it's hard to assign a positive, neutral, or negative assessment.

The third tweet: ""rt $ aapl algos triggered sell in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 10:06 , p / t 107.50 $ goog $ fb $ amzn $ tsla $ nflx $ bidu $ gpro $ baba $ qqq hft""

This looks like another one where the user is saying Apple's stock crossed a level related to a platform, but again, without knowing what that level refers to and how it relates to APLUS ALGO'S performance, I can't assess sentiment. It might be a different reason for a sell-off.

The fourth tweet: ""rt $ aapl algos triggered sell in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 09:32 , p / t 107.50 $ goog $ fb $ amzn $ tsla $ nflx $ bidu $ gpro $ baba $ qqq hft""

Again, this is similar to the previous ones. It's another trigger for a sell-off event on a platform mentioned in the tweet. But like the others, without more context or evidence of a specific cause, it's challenging to determine if this was positive, neutral, or negative.

Now, looking at the fifth tweet: ""rt AT_USER internet : fastest revenue growth ( 1yr ) 1 $ lc ( 131 % ) 2 $ twtr 15 $ fb ( 63 % ) 22 $ baba 25 $ lnkd 35 $ googl 56 $ yhoo ( - 3 % ) ht …""

This one is more about the internet, specifically mentioning AT_USER as the user. It talks about revenue growth for some companies with different percentages and prices. The term ""fastest revenue growth (1yr)"" indicates that a significant increase in revenue over a year was mentioned.

However, this tweet seems to be more about general market data rather than APLUS ALGO'S performance. There's no mention of the stock price or any specific events related to Apple Inc. Unless the company is part of the companies being discussed here (like Facebook, Twilio, etc.), which I know are unrelated, it doesn't impact APLUS ALGO'S.

Putting all these together, none of the tweets provide clear or direct information about how APLUS ALGO'S is performing. They either talk about other companies with data points that don't tie into Apple's performance or mention events that could be market-moving but lack specific causes. Without more context or evidence related to the stock price changes, it's impossible to accurately assess whether this tweet contributes positively, neutrally, or negatively to APLUS ALGO'S."
2015-01-23,Positive,"Alright, so I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of BABA (BAB) and figure out if it's positive, neutral, or negative.

First, looking at each tweet individually. Tweets 1-5 all mention BABA trading above its moving averages—like 95, 99, 107, 114, 118 bpts higher than f/v and p/t of 101. These are positive indicators because it suggests the stock is still strong relative to its price action.

Then there are tweets that talk about strategies or events: tweet 3 mentions an algebraic strategy triggered by sigma-x, crossfinder, ats, lx at 10:42 with a p/t of 101.00. That's more speculative and could be seen as a positive sign if the event is good news.

But wait, I should also consider that some tweets are too short-lived or have low attention. For example, tweet 7 talks about algos triggering sells at 10:42, but it’s just an isolated event. It doesn’t consistently go up and down, so it might not have a lasting impact.

The rest of the tweets (tweets 8-9) are similar to the ones before, still showing strong relative strength. So most of them are positive.

I need to weigh these factors. While some events boost sentiment positively, others could be due to market noise or short-term movements. The overall trend is that BABA is trading above its moving averages, which generally indicates good momentum. However, the fact that there are specific strategies and speculative mentions might raise the bar for positive sentiment.

But wait, I should also consider the context of the tweets. They seem more like news articles than real-time updates. Real-time data would be more indicative of current trends. So maybe some of these tweets aren't accurate or could lead to sudden price swings.

Given all this, it's a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, the relative strength and some speculative information point towards a positive trend. But I'm not sure if that's enough to outweigh the potential for short-term noise or unexpected events.

In conclusion, while there are strong indicators suggesting BABA is in good shape, the presence of specific strategies might be an outlier. I think it leans more toward [Positive] as the overall sentiment."

2015-01-26,Positive,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how these tweets are affecting the stock price of [baba]. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the first tweet: It mentions AT_USER and a bunch of stocks, then talks about the earnings calendar. Not sure what that means exactly but maybe it's signaling positive trends in the company or sectors. Not seeing an immediate upshot here, so probably neutral.

The second tweet is interesting because it says the spy bought into the stock after a red color pattern, making it look bullish. I remember the red pattern is often used by traders to signal potential buying. So that could suggest some positive sentiment for [baba]. However, the user also mentions long positions in BABA and APEX, which are both tech stocks, implying they expect those to perform well as well.

Third tweet talks about NFLX going up because APLX did it last week and expects ABLIX to follow. I know NFL is related to the NFL team, but I don't have specific info on how that ties to [baba]. It's more of a personal story from the user talking about teams, so maybe not directly impacting [baba] negatively.

Fourth tweet says BABA received another 16k shares since June 11. That sounds like news coming in as positive earnings data could boost stock prices. The user is expecting similar reactions from other tech companies mentioned—BABA, BABA again, YHOO. 

Putting it all together: There are some mentions of stock movements and expected reactions to earnings reports. Some tweets point towards positive trends or signals about upcoming trades. While there's no outright statement like ""the stock will rise,"" the emphasis on earnings data suggests potential optimism. So overall sentiment seems positive enough, but not sure if it's strong or just moderately so."
2015-01-27,Positive,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of $BABA (which is Alphabet Inc., part of Google). Let me break down each tweet and see what they're saying.

Starting with tweet 1: ""let's not be crazy here , we will see largest earnings report in history and if you think euro qe won't go into $ aapl & $ baba , check yourself."" This seems like it's warning investors about the big earnings report, which usually indicates good news. So that could be positive for stock prices because earnings can boost confidence.

Tweet 2: ""$ baba - yahoo to spin off alibaba stake URL"" suggests that Google is selling its Alibaba stake. Spin-offs often indicate a strategic decision and sometimes show financial health of another company. This could mean reducing reliance on Alibaba, which might affect the overall business model but if it's good for Google, maybe positive.

Tweet 3: ""rt AT_USER china audit spotlights counterfeit risk for e-commerce URL $ baba $ jd $ jmei"" talks about a Chinese audit focusing on counterfeit risks in e-commerce. Counterfeit products are bad for the company because they can cause issues with customers and possibly affect revenue. This seems like a negative point because it could hurt BABA.

Tweet 4: ""$ baba fsubcschamps : i'm a buyer below 100 : fsubcschamps URL"" mentions purchasing $BABA at prices under $100, which might be a sign of buying at lower valuations. Sometimes, stock price actions can indicate investor sentiment towards the company, but if it's just fluctuating, it might not have a big impact.

Tweet 5: ""rt $ aapl algos triggered buy in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 09:31 , p / t 115.00 $ goog $ fb $ amzn $ nflx $bidu $ gpro $ baba $ tsla $ qqq hft"" indicates that Google is buying into BABA when it's already at around $115. This could mean the stock is undervalued, so positive because investors might be buying when prices are higher than market expects.

Tweet 6: ""rt AT_USER i like AT_USER spinning off $ baba stock & listening to shareholders , from corpgov view . ceo sealed her future few more years ! …"" Expressing enthusiasm about the spin-off and looking forward could boost investor confidence, which is positive for the stock price.

Tweet 7: ""top stock lookups on URL ysty : $ aapl , $ msft , $ baba , $ fb , $ ge , $ box , $ spy , $ f , $ ibm , $ gild , $ t , $ twtr , $ c , $ rig . $ uso"" is listing possible stocks to buy, but there's no mention of BABA. So this tweet doesn't directly affect the stock price.

Tweet 8: Same as tweet 5 but a bit different phrasing: ""nice move AT_USER ' AT_USER yahoo to spin off alibaba stake into separate company $ baba $ yhoo URL"" again about buying BABA when it's at $115. This seems similar to tweet 5, indicating an interest in purchasing.

Tweet 9: ""nice move AT_USER ' AT_USER yahoo to spin off alibaba stake into separate company $ baba $ yhoo URL"" is the same as tweet 8 and 5. It just reinforces the idea that they're interested in buying BABA when it's around $115.

Putting it all together, the tweets are mostly signaling actions (tweets 1,2,5,6,8) where Google either expects earnings (tweets 1,5,6,8), is spinning off a division (tweets 2,8), or is buying at specific times (tweets 5,6,8). These signals can indicate investor confidence and might lead to positive stock reactions. However, the tweet about counterfeit risks (tweet 3) seems more negative as it could hurt BABA's reputation if products are fake.

So overall sentiment leans towards Positive because of the strategic actions and lower valuations, but there's a little Negative note from potential issues with counterfeit products."
2015-01-28,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about BABA stock and determine their impact on its future price. I'm not too familiar with all the financial terms here, so I'll have to go through each tweet step by step.

Starting with the first tweet: ""i hate fakes . you have no idea $ baba nothing new , constant press on fakes this is china will it die ? uh , richest man in china remember."" It seems like someone is criticizing BABA, which could either be positive or negative. The mention of China and a reference to Jack Ma suggests some concern, maybe about the company's growth potential.

Second tweet: ""AT_USER what's your take on $ baba right before earnings ?"" This sounds like an informative tweet asking for opinions right before earnings are expected. It might indicate investor interest but not much sentiment yet.

Third tweet combines Facebook, Alibaba, Baidu, and Google into a tweet about profits. It seems to be making a comparison or critique between the three on the other stocks. The mention of Google's search profits could affect investor views on BABA since it's part of their ecosystem.

Fourth tweet is an explicit link asking for stock information. That might make some investors anxious, but without context, it's hard to tell about sentiment.

Fifth tweet says that $ Aapl brings up the overall market and earnings growth. This would likely boost the market, supporting BABA as a defensive stock. It seems positive.

Sixth tweet mentions YHOO spinning off Alibaba for tax-free reasons. This could reduce competition, possibly affecting BABA's profitability or growth.

Seventh tweet says HTH made a notable reversal ending down 3.2%. Reversal might indicate confidence in the stock price drop, which is often seen as selling pressure, potentially negative.

Eighth tweet talks about $ Baba buying under $100 for earnings and not blowing Jack Ma's first E. R., implying potential for higher valuations or lack of success. This could be positive if expectations are high but negative if it leads to disappointment.

Ninth tweet lists a variety of stocks in trade setups, including SPX, AMZN, BABA, etc. This shows interest in multiple sectors, which is generally good for diversification and might not directly affect BABA's price unless the sector impacts its performance.

Tenth tweet includes AGL, TSLA, TWTR in trade setups. These are tech stocks. Maybe it shows interest in tech-related companies but doesn't directly talk about BABA.

Eleventh tweet says XOM is picking up momos and BABA dust and alco. It sounds like a marketing push or promotional tweet that could boost investor confidence, which would be positive for BABA.

Twelfth tweet from Fly News: AOL sinks after downgrade due to no YHOO interest. This could indicate that YHOO's stock performance might affect the broader market or individual stocks, possibly affecting BABA indirectly by influencing YHOO's stock price.

Thirteenth tweet says $ Baba is not a stock but a typo or misunderstanding. This seems like a negative comment about the company itself, which would strongly impact its sentiment.

Fourteenth and fifteenth tweets mention ECIG stock chart and GFI, BABA, GLD. These are less known stocks, so their information doesn't directly affect BABA unless they have a significant impact on the market or investor sentiment indirectly.

Looking through all these tweets, some are contradicting each other. For example, tweet 12 mentions AOL being down due to YHOO interest but not explicitly about BABA. Additionally, tweet 13 clearly states that $ BABA is not a stock, which would be a direct negative impact.

The overall sentiment seems mixed because there are conflicting tweets and some positive ones. However, the dominant trend seems towards positive because multiple tweets mention earnings reports (tweets 5 and 9) and promotional activities (tweets 11, 13). But tweet 13 is contradictory because it's about BABA not being a stock, which would be a strong negative.

Considering all factors—positive mentions from the market, some technicals like earnings, but a direct contradiction that makes it negative. The overall sentiment is leaning towards [Negative] because there are clearly negative tweets, despite positive ones."
2015-01-29,Negative,"Alright, so I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company and categorize them as Positive, Neutral, or Negative. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet talks about $psti, hedging, and ETFs but doesn't provide clear sentiment towards the stock.
2. Tweet 2 mentions AT_USER alibaba and refers to AT_USER's URL without indicating if they are happy or negative about it.
3. Tweets 3-5 discuss $baba and mention its performance in comparison with other stocks.
4. Tweet 6 talks about AT_USER's earnings report and mentions a closing bell, but the sentiment isn't clear here.
5. Tweets 7-10 discuss revenue reports for alibaba and provide stock price changes.
6. Tweet 8 refers to alibaba's earnings and mentions a premarket close without sentiment cues.
7. Tweet 9 discusses revenue despite missing estimates and shares falling.
8. Tweets 10-25 cover different topics like cash raises, stock performance of $baba, $fb, $yhu, and others, with varying sentiments.
9. Tweet 32 is about the company's stock being down after a revenue surprise.

After analyzing each tweet, I notice that some mention the stock falling in price, others provide positive news about earnings or other investments. The majority of tweets either mention performance or financial reports without strong, clear sentiment indicators. Some are neutral because they don't specify how the stock is performing relative to others. However, a few negative points like markdown mentions and mentions of being ""all over the sell"" suggest potential for a negative impact.

Overall, while there's some variation in opinions, the main themes are mostly positive in terms of earnings and performance but with mixed reactions from different angles. There aren't consistent strong indicators that push the stock up or down."
2015-01-30,Negative,"Alright, I'm looking at these tweets and trying to figure out if they're positive, negative, or neutral about $BABA stock. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

First tweet: It mentions a comeback in the premarket but says real traders are coming within 2 minutes. That sounds like good news for those who follow the stock, so probably positive.

Second tweet is a retweet of a user's message where they don't want to save her and she doesn't wanna be saved. The mention of $BABA URL suggests that the sentiment is about the stock being undervalued or something else, but it's not explicitly clear. Maybe neutral?

Third tweet says DJIA closed up because of jobs data and earnings for BAGA andgoog. That sounds positive news for the overall market, so probably positive.

Fourth tweet mentions $BABA holding up but isn't a convincing bounce, expecting to retest lows. So mixed, maybe still positive but cautious.

Fifth tweet just says $BABA is trading higher. Simple and straightforward, likely positive.

Sixth tweet is about avoiding buying the most expensive bubble since the start of humanity. The mention of BAGA makes me think it's a concern, so negative sentiment.

Seventh tweet is about media news on January 30, 2015, but I don't know what that relates to specifically, maybe not relevant to stock performance.

Eighth tweet from stocktwits suggests $BABA should be bought based on weakness and says PACIFIC CREEST cut their price target. This indicates confidence in the stock, so positive.

Ninth tweet mentions glassy shorting BAGA at 90.75 and thinking about it. It's a bit vague but suggests some sell pressure or interest, which could be neutral.

Tenth tweet from stocktwits says they disagree with Jack Ma and doubt his legitimacy, though $BABA is based in the Cayman Islands. Not sure if this relates to the stock performance.

Eleventh tweet comments on BAGA analyst cutting estimates after earnings. This might indicate confidence but could be a sign of shorting or fear, making it neutral.

Overall, there are some positive tweets and a couple negative ones. The overall sentiment seems mixed with some positives and negatives balancing out."
2015-01-31,Negative,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on a company's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

The first tweet mentions that an u.s. law firm is suing Alibaba because they're making misleading statements about $baba (which is likely a typo for BABA, which stands for BetaGamma AlphaTheta? Or maybe it's another stock symbol. Wait, let me check the context. The user says ""new picks coming: URL $ segi $ baba $ swet."" Hmm, that might be pointing towards specific stocks or something else. Maybe it's a typo and they meant to mention specific companies.

But focusing on the first tweet: it says a u.s. law firm is suing Alibaba for misleading statements and hiding regulatory scrutiny. That sounds serious. Anticipating that would probably hurt their stock price because investors expect things to be clear and honest. So this tweet is likely negative.

The second tweet says penny stock picks gained 160% this week! They also mention new picks coming: URL $ segi $ baba $ swet. This seems positive, as it's showing gains and indicating new opportunities. But the first tweet is a more serious one about Alibaba. Since the market might be affected by the negative news from Alibaba, but the second tweet shows growth in penny stocks, which could be mixed. Maybe the overall impact isn't clear yet.

The third tweet says alibaba now has more shoppers than the u.s. people on their websites URL - $ baba URL. Wait, that seems a bit unclear. It mentions shopping pages with more users for alibaba and maybe a typo with BABA again? This might be misleading or inaccurate information about Alibaba's user numbers, which could affect investor sentiment if it leads to concerns about security or trust.

Putting it all together: The first tweet is definitely negative about Alibaba. The second shows positive news about penny stocks but without context on the main company being discussed. The third tweet has some ambiguity in content and possibly affects user experience for users. So overall, the most significant factor is the negative sentiment from the first tweet, which could have a broader impact than other tweets.

Therefore, the stock price is likely Negative."
2015-02-01,Neutral,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the likely impact on a company's stock price based on these tweets. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking through them, I see several mentions of stocks like ""spy,"" ""gld,"" ""baba,"" and others. It seems like some users are discussing various tech and financial sectors, so it's probably a company that's in these areas.

Next, for each tweet, I have to separate the positive and negative factors. The user is talking about their ""biggest 500 tweets"" from different sources. Let me go through them one by one.

The first tweet mentions the user's performance over time and stock positions. It doesn't talk much about specific events related to a company, so maybe this is neutral because it's more about personal trends than major news affecting the stock.

The second tweet says there's no 'goat in town' and recommends gold, silver, and some stocks. Again, it's talking about other investments, not specific to a single company. So probably no significant impact here.

Third and fourth tweets are duplicates of each other, mentioning a video of a user's stock analysis on major support stocks like spy, iwm (which I think is Webull), aapl (Apple), etc. These seem more like commentary rather than specific recommendations about a target company.

The fifth tweet says new posts are on major support stocks. It doesn't mention any specific stock or event related to performance, so again, this might not affect the overall stock price negatively.

Putting it all together, none of these tweets are directly mentioning a particular stock, discussing factors like personal trends, investments in other companies, or news about specific sectors. So there's no strong positive or negative sentiment here."
2015-02-02,Positive,"Alright, let's try to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price for a given company. The user has provided four tweets and wants us to analyze their likely effects on a stock. I need to follow the solving process they outlined.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. 

1. $ agio news updated monday , february 2 , 2015 – This seems like a typo. Maybe it's AGIO or something else? I'm not sure yet.
2. charlie rose interview with jack ma at davos : URL via AT_USER $ baba $ sftby
3. is giant tech in a new era of self-cannibalization : AT_USER shares his thoughts : URL $ yhoo $ baba $ fb $ googl $ crm
4. $ amzn $ baba : amazon earnings review : fruits of my labor : URL

Looking at the fourth tweet, it mentions Amazon's earnings and the fruits of one's labor. I remember that Jack Ma was a big figure at Apple, but isn't he a co-founder of Amazon too? His influence might have been significant in Amazon's success.

But wait, what about the other tweets? The second tweet is an interview with Jack Ma. If it's from a public source like AT_USER, it could be real or fake. However, the first and third tweets mention AGIO, YHOO, FB, GOGL, and CRM. Those are likely unrelated to Amazon.

Now, considering that the fourth tweet is about Amazon's earnings, which is a major financial metric. Positive news from Amazon often boosts stock prices. Additionally, if Jack Ma was interviewed publicly, it could add credibility to the report, making the sentiment more positive.

The other tweets don't seem to provide relevant information for the target stock, so they can be considered as background noise or unrelated.

Putting this together, the main tweet that affects the stock is the one about Amazon's earnings. This should have a positive impact on the stock price. The interviews and unrelated tweets might influence investor sentiment but are less significant than the earnings report."
2015-02-03,Positive,"Alright, so I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for the given company. Let me start by breaking down each tweet.

First tweet: ""rt AT_USER one perfect short setup for tomorrow URL alerts + 60 % since inception ! $ goog $ aapl $ twtr $ fb $ baba $ c"". This seems like a positive sign with numbers and mentions of stocks. The user is suggesting something related to investing or trading, which could indicate optimism.

Second tweet: ""rt AT_USER china internet use rises on mobile payments , travel URL ibdnews via AT_USER $ baba $ jd $ bidu $ …"". Again, the mention of a company (baba) and multiple stocks suggests positive growth in their users, but without specific data or context, it's hard to assess the impact.

Third tweet: ""the biggest risk facing alibaba moving forward URL $ vips $ baba"". This is critical information. If Alibaba is on the brink of a significant drop, that would be negative because it could cause investor panic and decrease demand for their stock.

Fourth tweet: ""deals of the day : $ vrx , $ slxp , $ lea , $ baba , ouya , $ clf , $ adm , $ twc , $ cmcsa , $ emn , $ aapl URL URL"". Positive news from various deals, which could be good news for investors.

Fifth tweet: ""jd $ baba $ jd $ bidu $ tcehy china's internet population hits 649 million , 86 pct on phones URL"". Positive numbers about internet growth in China. This is a positive sign that could boost the company's performance.

Now, compiling these thoughts: The first and fourth tweets suggest good news from potential investments or deals, which would be positive. The third tweet points to Alibaba facing significant risk, which would be negative. The second and fifth tweets mention growth but lack specific metrics, making them less conclusive.

Given that only one tweet is clearly negative (the third), the overall sentiment might lean towards positive because there are multiple positive tweets outweighing the single negative one."
2015-02-04,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on stock prices. So, each tweet seems to be related to a stock, probably from a company that's being discussed.

Looking at the first tweet: ""speculative trading rocks ! URL $ goog $ pcln $ twtr $ fb $ aapl $ ebay $ gm $ dust $ baba URL"". Hmm, this one mentions several companies like Google (GOOGL), PCLN, TWTR, FB, Apple, GM, DUST, BABA. It's a bit confusing because the abbreviations aren't familiar to me. Maybe it's some kind of buzzword or a typo? I'm not sure what these companies represent. The use of $ and URLs suggests it's related to stock ticker symbols, but without knowing each company, I can't be certain.

The second tweet is: ""rt $ qqq algos triggered sell in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 14:08 , p / t 101.50 quant $ goog $ baba $ fb $ nflx $ bidu $ gpro $ tsla $ aapl hft"". This one mentions several stocks like QQQ, ALGOS, SIGMA-X, CROSSfinder, ATS, LX, GOOG, BABA, FB, NFLX, BIDU, GPRO, TSLA, APL, and HFT. Some of these seem familiar, like GOOG is Google, BABA is BNTA or something else? I'm not sure about the others.

The third tweet: ""it's a bird , it's a plane , nah that's just an alibaba drone . $ baba gets into drone delivery business . your move $ amzn URL"". This seems to suggest that BABA is entering the drone delivery sector, and Amazon (AMZN) is following. I'm not sure about these companies either.

Now, considering each tweet individually isn't giving me enough context because of the abbreviations and unfamiliar stocks. Without knowing the exact companies involved, it's hard to assess their impact on stock prices. For example, if BABA is a tech company, its performance could be influenced by market trends or industry changes. Similarly, Google's stock can be affected by economic indicators or product launches.

Since I don't have enough information about each stock symbol, I can't determine the overall sentiment for each tweet individually. However, looking at the context, some tweets are talking about stock movements like selling sells and buys (as in ""rt $ qqq algos triggered sell..."") which might indicate sentiment towards certain stocks.

But wait, maybe there's more to it. If all three tweets are pointing towards BABA as a potential investment, but without specific data on their performance, I can't assess the impact. Alternatively, if these tweets are about trends or upcoming projects, they could influence future stock prices by signaling shifts in investor interest or expectations.

I think the best approach is to say that without knowing the exact companies, it's impossible to determine the overall sentiment. But looking at the positive and negative aspects, if each tweet indicates a trend or potential increase in stock price, maybe we can consider an overall positive outlook? Or if they're suggesting selling, perhaps negative.

But honestly, I'm stuck because I don't know which stocks these abbreviations represent. Maybe I should stick to my initial thought that without knowing the companies, it's impossible to give a clear answer. However, since the user wants me to provide an analysis, maybe I can assume that BABA is involved and there are positive tweets suggesting potential moves."
2015-02-05,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of baba. First, I need to understand what each tweet is saying.

Starting with the first tweet: ""baba -0.67 % stock charts $ baba alibaba group holding ltd . ads ( nyse ) last updated : 02/04 / 2015 18:32 : 27 baba st URL"". It seems like this is an update about the stock's performance or some other information related to BABA. The use of ""holding ltd"" might indicate a company they're associated with, but it's not clear what that means here.

The second tweet: ""$ bidu or $ baba , which one you like most ? check our thesis here URL"". This is an invitation for the user to choose between two stock symbols, BUDU and BABA. It seems like this could be a call for action, but without more context, it's hard to tell if it's positive or negative.

The third tweet: ""rt AT_USER potential bounce area for $ baba"". The word ""rt"" might stand for ""reply"" or ""replies,"" so maybe the user is saying something about potential news related to BABA. It could be indicating that there's a potential increase in price, which would lean towards positive sentiment.

The fourth tweet: ""rt $ aapl algos breaking daily lows in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx , p / t 117.00 quant $ goog $ baba $ fb $ nflx $ gpro $ tsla $ qqq hft"". This looks like it's making a trade or analysis about BABA, specifically mentioning other stocks and trading levels. If they're breaking daily lows, that might suggest good opportunities, which is positive.

The fifth tweet: ""while $ baba is close to its lowest level since ipo , ecommerce is to reach $ 1 trillion by 2019 in china . mcommerce URL"". Here, it's talking about the stock being near a low and future goals for e-commerce. This seems like a positive outlook because reaching new levels can boost prices.

The sixth tweet: ""rt $ qqq trading 151 bpts above f / v , subject to stat arbs , p / t 102.00 quant $ goog $ baba $ fb $ nflx $bidu $ gpro $ tsla $ aapl hft"". This is another trade alert about BABA, mentioning it's trading higher than the floor price and has specific statistics. This could be seen as positive because higher prices are generally favorable.

Putting it all together, the tweets are either inviting action or making positive statements about trends, stock performance, and outlooks. They don't show any clear positives or negatives but rather encourage confidence in the stock's potential. So overall sentiment should be positive."
2015-02-06,Neutral,"Alright, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on BABA's stock price. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

First tweet is a newsletter sign-up. It doesn't seem positive or negative; it just offers another email service. Not much can be done here since it's just a notification.

Next, the tweet asks how $BABA can act like something garbajé, which I think is a typo for ""garbage"" in French. It seems like someone might be frustrated with BABA's performance or strategy and is questioning its effectiveness. This could indicate investor dissatisfaction but not a clear positive or negative signal yet.

Third tweet discusses AT_USER cnbc's discussion on buying $GOOG (Google) and $TWTR (Twitter) as an idea. The mention of Google sounds like it might be a suggestion for BABA stock, possibly related to a strategy or trend. It could positively influence investor sentiment if people are encouraged, but without specifics, hard to say.

Fourth tweet mentions that the northern light issue has been resolved and mentions URLs: $SAIC (which I think is Social Media Action Center) and $TBLA (maybe trading desk in BABA). The term ""saic"" might be a typo. If this issue was affecting BABA's performance, it could have caused investors to doubt the stock. However, without knowing if SAIC has impacted past or current quarters, it's hard to assess.

Putting it all together: One tweet is informative but minor. Two are negative in content but not enough to dominate. The third could be positive with an intent to attract investment attention. Fourth might have an impact on sentiment based on issues affecting performance. Overall, while some tweets have potential positive influences, others indicate dissatisfaction or uncertainty. It's a mix of both factors."
2015-02-07,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out the best way to analyze these tweets for their impact on stock prices. The user provided two tweets, and I need to determine if they'll lead to a positive, neutral, or negative outlook for a given company.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""rsi ( 14 ) 26.99 ... buy imo URL $ baba URL"". Hmm, RSI is a momentum indicator in technical analysis, but it's also showing prices around $27. The term ""buy"" seems to suggest that the company is expecting its stock price to increase, so that might be positive. But then there's a mention of a $ symbol and a URL for BABA stock. Maybe some confusion here. I think the main takeaway here is ""buy"", which implies a bullish sentiment.

Now, the second tweet: ""rsi ( 73 ) 26.99 ... short baba$ 500.01 ..."". The RSI of 73 is in the range that suggests overbought or oversold conditions, depending on how it's interpreted. But the term ""short"" used here might be a red flag indicating potential for loss if the stock price drops. It's more about an indicator than a direct buy signal.

Putting these together, the first tweet leans positive with a buy signal, while the second is cautiously negative because of the short comment and mentions of $500. That could imply uncertainty or hesitation in the market. However, I think the main driver here might still be the ""buy"" phrase, which gives more weight to the bullish trend.

So overall, combining both tweets, there seems to be a mix but leaning towards positive sentiment because the primary action is buy. The other tweet doesn't contradict that too much but adds some context about short positions."
2015-02-08,Missing,File not found
2015-02-09,Positive,"Okay, so I'm looking at these tweets about BABA stock and trying to figure out their impact on the company's future stock price. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

First tweet: ""rt AT_USER alibaba invests $ 590 million in chinese smartphone maker meizu $ baba URL"". Hmm, this seems like BABA is involved in a major investment. Alibaba is a big tech company, and investing money in their smartphone brand could indicate interest or potential growth for BABA. So, that's probably positive.

Second tweet: ""rt AT_USER watching $ gene $ twtr $ shak $ achn $ gpro $ rgls $ p $ has $ yelp $ msi $ alks $ baba"". This one is more about analyzing stock metrics on Yelp and Twitter. It doesn't mention anything directly related to BABA's stock price or performance, just user interactions. So I think this tweet isn't relevant enough to affect the stock.

Third tweet: ""this less than optimistic article on $ baba"". If there's an article saying something about BABA, it could influence investor expectations. But since it's just a general opinion without specifics, it might not have a strong enough impact yet.

Fourth tweet: ""$ baba this upper gap might not fill until mid april 2015 if this keeps declining"". This seems like a forecasting comment. If the article is predicting that BABA will take time to fill its market cap because it's still declining, it suggests they're optimistic about their growth potential in the future. That could be positive for investors.

Fifth tweet: ""market caps : alibaba > facebook > amazon + twitter $ baba > $ fb > $ amzn + $ twtr URL"". This is comparing stock caps among different companies. It doesn't directly relate to BABA's performance or investment but provides context about other tech stocks.

So, putting it all together:
- The first tweet is positive because of the investment.
- The fourth tweet is also positive due to the future growth expectation.
- The third tweet isn't enough info; it's just a general opinion.
- The second and fifth tweets don't seem relevant.

Overall, both positive tweets are contributing positively to the outlook for BABA. I think these combine support from investments and positive market analysis, leading me to conclude a [Positive] sentiment overall."
2015-02-10,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze the given tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of BABA. Let me start by breaking down each tweet.

1. The first tweet mentions BABA, YO, and EBIQ, but it doesn't provide much information about a positive or negative factor related to BABA itself.
2. The second tweet talks about recent news on February 10, 2015, with the time mentioned being 6:07 am. However, it's unclear if this is relevant to BABA. It seems too specific and not directly linked to stock performance.
3. The third tweet questions whether ""one up day doesn't make a bottom"" regarding BABA. This could imply investor concern about the stock's trend or potential support after a dip.
4. The fourth tweet states that Alipay invested $590 million in Meizu Technology. Since Meizu is a tech company, and Alipay has been a major player in China's e-commerce space, this investment might indicate growth in revenue and earnings.
5. The fifth tweet mentions alipay offering an offer for eBay at $64 per share. This could be significant if eBay's performance is expected to improve, potentially impacting BABA which competes with it.
6. The sixth tweet repeats information from the fourth one about Alipay's investment.
7. The seventh tweet points out that netease's revenue has surges due to expanding email and e-commerce operations. This might indirectly support or impact BABA if they have comparable services.

Now, considering all these factors, the investments by Alipay are positive for both companies since it often leads to expansion of their respective business lines. eBay is a major competitor in China's e-commerce market, so an offer could affect its performance. However, netease being a related company might influence BABA through their growth. The user also mentioned ""one up day doesn't make a bottom"" which adds uncertainty, but the investments themselves are positive and significant.

Putting this together, I would expect a positive impact on BABA because Alipay's investments and potential expansion of its services could contribute positively to BABA's performance. However, the mention of eBay might be a competitive factor, but it's unlikely to outweigh the overall positive sentiment."
2015-02-11,Neutral,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of the given company. The user provided four tweets, each in different formats, and I need to assess their overall effect.

First, I'll go through each tweet one by one. 

1. The first tweet is a positive statement about a recovery in $ and mentions several stocks: goog, baba, twtr, fb, etc. The word ""lock"" seems like a typo or placeholder for something important, maybe the stock ticker symbol. Positive keywords here include 'recovery' which suggests good news. So, this tweet is likely positive.

2. The second tweet starts with ""rt AT_USER nice recovery in $ lock this morning . congrats to those who caught the bottom URL..."" Similar structure as the first one but again mentions a recovery and other stocks. It's positive because it's reinforcing the idea of a good market movement. So, another positive sentiment.

3. The third tweet is more technical: ""rt $ tsla algos triggered sell in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 09:29 p / t 205.00 quant $ goog $ baba $ fb $ nflx $ bidu $ gpro $ akam $ qqq hft"". The word ""sell"" suggests that the company is selling stock or has a negative sentiment around its stock price, which could lead to a drop in value. So this tweet is negative.

4. The fourth tweet is more about an update on $ baba viewed from our perspective, mentioning several other stocks and calling it ""pocas palabras ! !"". Again, there's positive language like ""viewed"" and ""pocas palabras"", which implies a favorable opinion or positive outlook. This could be seen as a positive sentiment towards the stock.

Now, combining these thoughts: The first two tweets are clearly positive due to recovery mentions and other stocks. The third is negative because of technical sell signs. The fourth is positive about a favorable view from others. 

However, some factors might cancel each other out. The positive tweets mention recovery in $ and have good stock symbols, which could be strong. But the negative tweet shows selling in specific stocks, which might indicate fear or concern, affecting investor sentiment. The neutral tweet is less impactful.

Overall, there's a mix of positive, negative, and neutral factors. Positive tweets suggest a general positive market trend, but the negative one shows some concern about future prices. Neutral might be due to incomplete info or minor impact. 

Considering all this, the overall sentiment isn't clear-cut. There are elements that push in different directions. So I'll go with aneutral conclusion because the information is mixed."
2015-02-12,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether these tweets are going to have a positive, neutral, or negative impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided some tweets and wants me to analyze their likely effect.

First, let's look at each tweet one by one. 

1. The first tweet is from AT_USER saying, ""yes . wish i were enjoying $ baba as well . hanging in there ."" This seems like an upbeat message, encouraging the user to enjoy the stock they're investing in and staying patient or content. That sounds positive.

2. The second tweet is AT_USER long $ baba. Having a long position on a stock can be very influential because it shows confidence and determination. It's probably going to make people buy more, which could increase the stock price. This should be positive.

3. The third tweet mentions $ baba, $ dis, $ t & $ sbux making their hearts go pitter-patter. So they're talking about multiple stocks related to $ baba. This is a lot of excitement and support for baba's position, which probably boosts its price. Positive impact on the stock.

4. The fourth tweet is AT_USER talking about the stock market analysis from February 11th 2015, which was an Indis ciency day. While it's historical context, it doesn't directly mention the stock or a positive sentiment. It might just be providing info, so maybe neutral because it's not reflecting current opinions.

5. The fifth tweet is $ baba kaboooom URL. I'm not sure what ""kabooom"" means here. Maybe a typo or an acronym? Without more context, it's hard to assess. Perhaps the user is excited about it, but without clear sentiment, it could be neutral.

6. The sixth tweet is rt AT_USER $ baba hod .. Not much information there. Just a vague mention of $ baba. It seems like a casual comment; not enough data to determine sentiment.

7. The seventh tweet mentions $ baba trading 1.05 above F/B/V, with p/t ratio at 84.00 and quant range for GSPC. This is talking about the stock's price compared to its fundamentals. A positive price-to-earnings ratio suggests good performance, which could lead to an upward movement in the stock price. So this would be positive.

Summarizing each tweet: The first, second, third, and seventh are all positive because they're encouraging investment or showing support directly. The fourth is neutral due to historical context without current sentiment. The fifth and sixth are too vague for a clear impact. 

So overall, it's mostly positive tweets with a few neutral ones that don't provide much insight. Therefore, the stock is likely going up."
2015-02-13,Negative,"Alright, so I've got this task where I need to analyze some tweets about a stock to determine if it's going to be positive, neutral, or negative for its future stock price. The user provided three tweets and a target stock symbol, which isn't specified here, but I think from the context, it might be BABA since that's mentioned in the first tweet.

First, let me parse each tweet step by step. 

The process involves identifying the target stock, breaking down each tweet into positive and negative factors, assessing sentiment for each factor, and then combining them to decide on the overall impact. 

Looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER AT_USER $ baba this one of those times nervous people will get burned . $ baba gaps up tuesday morning will leave $ 90 i …"". Hmm, it's pretty vague. It seems like BABA is mentioned as a stock symbol with mentions of people getting burned and a prediction about its price moving down to $90 on Tuesday morning. The structure here isn't very informative; maybe the sentiment isn't clear or there are too many variables without context.

The second tweet: ""$ baba may get the headlines , but its sister company , ant financial , may soon eclipse it . my take at AT_USER URL"". This one seems more specific. It suggests that BABA is about to face competition from another company, ant financial, which might eventually dominate. The sentiment here is probably negative because of the prediction and the mention of a competitor eclipsing.

The third tweet: ""done for today , + $ 9700 $ gene $ baba URL"". This one has a clear positive tone with a big price increase, plus some links that look like stock prices. It's straightforward, so it's likely positive.

Now, combining these factors:

1. First tweet is ambiguous and lacks context; maybe neutral.
2. Second tweet is very specific but also negative because of the competitor.
3. Third tweet is clear and positive with a big price increase.

So overall, there are mixed signals: some positive about BABA increasing in value, others predicting it will be overshadowed by another company. But since one of the tweets is pretty specific about the outcome, especially the $9700 move, that could tip things positively despite the others being more cautious.

Wait, but the target stock isn't specified. The third tweet mentions ""done for today,"" so maybe they're analyzing if it's going to be held until today? But the first two are vague, and the second one is definitely negative.

In a real scenario, I might also consider the trend of other companies moving in relation to BABA. If another company is expected to eclipse it, that could push up the stock price temporarily, but if so many things happen, especially if it's about to reach a peak or significant move, it might be positive. However, given the specific mention of the $9700 increase, maybe the overall sentiment leans towards positive.

I'm not entirely sure because without context from other tweets or information on ant financial and BABA's position in that company, I can't make a 100% accurate assessment. But since it's one tweet with a clear price move, I might lean more towards positive."
2015-02-14,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on a company's stock price based on their impact score as ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"". Let me go through each tweet step by step.

The target stock symbol isn't directly given, but looking at the second tweet mentions stocks trending in $x$ dollars. I'm not sure if this is a specific company or just a general trend. 

First tweet: It talks about market analytics app being featured on a new app for iPhone. The mention of a market parse and URL doesn't specify the company, so it's unclear which stock this affects.

Second tweet has multiple stock names listed: $xiv$, $xiv$, $lvs$, $csco$, etc., with ""baba"" in there as well. I don't recognize any of these abbreviations. They might be typo or placeholder, and ""csco"" could refer to a company like C-Score. Maybe it's a typo for something else, but without context, it's hard to tell.

Given the uncertainty from the second tweet, especially since I don't know which stock is being referred to, I can only make limited assumptions. The first tweet doesn't provide any relevant information about the stock either, so its impact is unclear.

Considering all factors, both tweets lack clear context or references to a specific company's stock. Therefore, their combined impact on the stock price remains neutral."

2015-02-16,Negative,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. The user provided six tweets and wants me to analyze them step by step. Let's break it down.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Hmm, looking through them, some seem to mention specific stocks like SPY,googl, twtr, baba. I think the user might be focusing on a particular company here, maybe baba or something related since several tweets involve that symbol. I'll go with baba for now.

Next, each tweet is a factor and an URL. My task is to separate positive and negative factors from each tweet. Let's take the first few:

1. ""rt AT_USER $ pcln tradewithjoe traders make real money - $ spy $ iwm $ qqq $ aapl $ fb $ twtr $ googl $ pcln $ baba ! URL …"" – This seems to mention several stocks, but the negative factors include things like making money, which could indicate short-term gains. The positive factor is saying they trade on the stock exchange.

2. ""follow me into live stock chat ! $ goog $ pcln $ twtr $ fb $ aapl $ ebay $ gm $ dust $ baba URL URL"" – Again, multiple stocks. The negative factors here are talking about going live in chat and making money elsewhere. Positive isn't obvious.

3. ""rt AT_USER china ’ s top two taxi-hailing services confirm that they will merge URL via AT_USER $ baba $ sftby $ tcehy"" – This tweet mentions a merge between two taxi services and the mention of BABA. So, negative because it talks about a merger, which could be bad for the stock if it's part of a larger financial deal.

4. ""rt AT_USER $ baba had world's largest ipo last yr but jack ma says 2014 was meh . nothin ' special URL AT_USER URL"" – Here, the user is upset about Jack Ma's comments about BABA's IPO and his own quote, which is negative. So, this is a clear negative factor.

5. ""rt AT_USER weekend review video : $ spy $ iwm $ qqq $ tlt $ gld $ aapl $ axp $ baba $ bidu $ fb $ twtr $ feye $ googl $ msft $ pcln $ tsla ht …"" – Again, multiple stocks. Positive factors are the stock exchange mention and other positive terms like ETFs. The negative factor here is nothin ' special URL AT_USER URL.

6. ""$ baba $ appl alipay URL"" – This tweet mentions two different stocks, BABA and APPL (Apple). The URL points to both. Both are companies, but since it's not specifying which one, I can't be sure. However, given that I'm focusing on BABA in these tweets, maybe this is a neutral or positive factor? Not sure yet.

Now, for each tweet:

1. Positive: tradewithjoe traders make real money.
   Negative: spy, iwm, qqq, aapl, fb, twtr, googl, baba.

2. Positive: twtr, fb, aapl, ebay, gm, dust, baba.
   Negative: goog, pcln, twtr, fb, aapl, ebay, gm, dust, baba.

3. Negative: merge with sftby and tcehy. But BABA isn't mentioned here.

4. Negative: Jack Ma's comments about his 2014 IPO and his own quote are negative.

5. Positive: gld, aapl, msft.
   Negative: spy, iwm, qqq, tlt, gld, aapl, axp, baba, bidu, fb, twtr, feye, googl, msft, pcln, tsla, ht.

6. Neutral or Positive? Since it's multiple stocks, but focusing on BABA: positive since it's mentioned in the URL, and maybe others aren't as relevant unless there's a pattern.

Now, combining all factors:

Positive tweets:
- tradewithjoe traders make real money ( tweet 1)
- twtr, fb, aapl, ebay, gm, dust, baba (tweet 2)

Negative tweets:
- spy, iwm, qqq, aapl, twtr, googl, baba, gld, msft, tsla (tweets 1,4,5,6)
- jack ma comments (tweet 4)
- merge mentioned (tweet3)
- baba in the URL (tweets2,6)

Looking at each negative tweet:
- spy: positive, I'm not sure if it's good or bad.
- iwm: not sure
- qqq: positive? Maybe?
- aapl: positive
- twtr: positive
- googl: positive
- baba in tweets1 and 2 is neutral
- gld: positive (maybe)
- msft: positive
- tsla: I'm not sure about that company, but possibly positive or negative

Negative factors seem too many, some conflicting. The overall sentiment seems mixed with multiple negative elements. But looking at tweet4, Jack Ma's comments are very negative, and the merge is also negative.

So maybe there's a strong negative impact because of the merge and his comments."
2015-02-17,Neutral,"Okay, so I have to analyze these tweets about the stock price of a company and determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First tweet: ""i would often get irritated when folks said trading was just gambling . now , i tell them i'm going to the casino . $ aapl $ baba $ tsla"". The user is expressing frustration because people used trading as gambling and is now advising them to go to a casino. I think this shows concern about the stock, which could be negative.

Second tweet: ""follow me into live stock chat ! $ goog $ pcln $ twtr $ fb $ aapl $ ebay $ gm $ dust $ baba URL URL"". This one seems to be encouraging people to follow them for live chat and mentions specific stocks. It's more about increasing visibility or interest in certain companies, which might suggest positive sentiment.

Third tweet: ""deals of the day : $ twx , $ aapl , $ mrvl , $ yhoo , $ fb , $ htz , $ c , $ baba , $ lbtya and more URL"". Similar to the second, this is promoting deals across multiple stocks. If there are deals being offered, that's often seen as positive news because it gives investors a reason to buy higher.

Fourth tweet: ""$ baba johncm : trailing stop . usually 5 % . : johncm URL"". This seems to advise people about a trailing stop in BABA stock and mentions a developer. It's more of a technical advice rather than an overall market trend, but it does provide information that could be useful.

Now, combining all these thoughts: The first tweet is negative because of frustration. Second suggests increasing visibility, positive. Third promotes deals—positive. Fourth gives specific advice about a stock, which can be helpful but not strong enough on its own. However, the third and second tweets are more about promoting current and future opportunities in the same company (BABA), so maybe they reinforce each other as positive."
2015-02-18,Positive,"Okay, so I have to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of Apple (AAPL). Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol, it's AAPL. Now, let's take each tweet one by one and analyze their factors.

The first tweet says: ""catch a winner in live chat $ goog $ pcln $ twtr $ fb $ aapl $ ebay $ gm $ dust $ baba URL URL"". Hmm, this seems like a list of stock symbols related to Apple, like GOOG for Alphabet Inc., PCLN for Price Control Limited, TWTR for Twilio, FB for Facebook, GM for General Motors, DUS for Directunion Solutions, and BABA for Black石 Capital. The user also mentions URL URLs here. I'm not exactly sure what ""catch a winner"" means in this context—maybe they're trying to get people to click on Apple's URL or something? Or perhaps it's a typo and just listing other companies. But since the target is AAPL, I think that part might be unrelated or maybe irrelevant for assessing Apple's stock performance.

Next tweet: ""rt AT_USER i like $ yhoo here rt AT_USER AT_USER long time no talk jim ! what do you think about starting a posn in $ baba at these …"". Okay, this one seems more relevant. The user is reacting to the stock price of BABA. They're using RT indicators, which I assume are reaction Twitter (RT) indicators that show how many people are following or engaging on social media. So they're probably talking about whether someone would like starting a position in BABA at these times. Positioning could indicate investor sentiment towards BABA. But without more context, it's hard to tell if this is positive, negative, or neutral.

Third tweet: ""watch $ baba today"". This one seems straightforward. The user is suggesting watching BABA stock. From a stock perspective, watching the stock price directly affects its visibility and trading volume. More people watch a company's stock could indicate higher interest from investors, which might lead to more trades. So this could be positive because it might attract more attention and increase demand.

Now, summarizing each tweet:
1. The first tweet is irrelevant or possibly related to other companies.
2. The second tweet talks about BABA but doesn't specify the sentiment towards Apple directly.
3. The third tweet suggests watching BABA stock, which could positively impact its performance by increasing visibility.

Considering all three tweets, while the third one seems like a direct suggestion, it might have an indirect positive effect on BABA's performance. However, without more context or analysis of why someone would start a position in BABA right now, I can't say for sure if this is a strong positive impact. It might just prompt people to watch the stock, which could attract some interest but isn't conclusive evidence.

Putting it all together, the tweets overall suggest that Apple's stock might benefit from increased visibility of another company, possibly because more people are watching BABA stock. This could lead to higher demand for Apple's products or services if BABA is a related sector or component. So overall sentiment seems positive."
2015-02-19,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me start by breaking down each tweet step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""with moves on $ thcz & $ suti our stock picks gained 342 % in the past 2 weeks ! big news : URL $ segi $ baba $ swet."" The word ""stock picks"" suggests it's about a tech company maybe, possibly SBI or something similar. 

Next, I separate the factors into positive and negative. For this tweet, since it mentions a significant gain in stock picks over two weeks, that's clearly positive. There's no mention of bad news here.

For the second tweet: ""tracking george soros ' portfolio - q4 2014 update URL $ aal $ aapl $ abbv $ act $ agn $ agro $ aig $ alle $ ally $ baba $ bidu."" It looks like this is about a person's portfolio updates, specifically Q4 2014. No negative signs here either; it's more about the company's performance.

Third tweet: ""$ xle percent change updated thursday , february 19 , 2015 09:07 : 14 am $ amgn $ srne $ sh $ baba URL."" Again, it mentions a stock called XLE. The ""percent change"" update might indicate some news about the stock's performance in February 2015.

Lastly, the fourth tweet: ""rt AT_USER alibaba's founder jack ma was rejected from 30 jobs , including kfc , before becoming the richest man in china . $ baba."" This one has a specific mention of Jack Ma being rejected and now being the richest. It seems positive about the company's success after a controversial career.

Now, evaluating each tweet: The first mentions stock gains, second portfolio info, third XLE info, and fourth is about the founder becoming rich. Each is supporting a positive outlook on their respective stocks or the company. There are no negative points mentioned here.

Putting it all together, all tweets seem to provide information that supports the idea of an improving stock market, especially for certain companies. So the overall sentiment is positive."
2015-02-20,Negative,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol, which seems to be ""baba"". That's a bit confusing because ""baba"" is not a known stock. Maybe it's a typo or some placeholder. I'll assume that the tweets are related to investing in BABA stock.

Now, the first tweet says, ""rt AT_USER alibaba's founder jack ma was rejected from 30 jobs , including kfc , before becoming the richest man in china . $ baba"". So, this seems like a news about Jack Ma being rejected for multiple jobs but ultimately making it the Richest in China. This is a positive story because it shows progress and potential for growth.

The second tweet is similar to the first one. It also mentions Jack Ma's job rejection but mentions BABA. I'll treat both as identical entries, meaning they're likely part of the same tweet or possibly multiple tweets pointing to the same information. So, this reinforces the positive narrative about his career and wealth potential.

Next, the third tweet says, ""$ baba also looks very weak going into next week ."" This suggests that the stock might not perform well in the coming weeks because it's perceived as weak. It could indicate negative news if investors are worried about the company's performance.

Then, there are several other tweets like ""with moves on $ thcz & $ suti our stock picks gained 342 % in the past 2 weeks ! big news : URL $ segi $ baba $ swet"". These look like individual stock pick mentions. If these stocks performed strongly over two weeks, it could be a positive sign for BABA's future performance.

However, one of them is about ""grpn"", which I'm not familiar with. It might have been a typo or a different company entirely. Without more context, it's hard to assess its impact, but the others point towards good news.

So, combining all these factors: we've got positive news about Jack Ma and potential growth, some weak-looking stock reports, strong performance of other stocks, and possibly mixed info on another company. But if most of the tweets are about BABA and positive trends elsewhere, it leans more positive overall.

I think that the dominant sentiment is towards a positive outcome because there's consistent support from various factors—job rejection (though positive), potential growth, and strong stock performances. The weak-looking stock report could be a dip but not the main focus. So, I'll conclude with [Positive]."
2015-02-21,Missing,File not found
2015-02-22,Positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out how to assess the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. The user has given me two examples, but in the query, they only provided one tweet. Let me see if there's more to this.

First, looking at the solving process provided, it seems that each tweet needs to be analyzed by separating positive and negative factors and then assessing the sentiment. However, I'm only given one tweet here. I wonder if there are multiple tweets or if this is just a single one to analyze. 

The user's query starts with ""1. URL penny stocks, nyse, and nasdaq trades from the stock market today."" This seems to be an informational tweet about the current state of certain penny stocks on NYSE and NASDAQ. It mentions that the price has increased by 296% last week and lists several names like $aegr, $baba, etc.

Okay, so based on this tweet alone, what can we infer? There's a mention of stock prices increasing, which generally suggests optimism about the market or company performance. Penny stocks are often seen as undervalued, and their increases could indicate strong fundamentals or positive news from investors.

Now, according to the solving process, I should separate each factor into positive and negative. In this case, it's just one tweet with multiple stock names mentioned. The overall impact would be the combination of all these factors. Since the tweets mention the stocks trading higher on NYSE and NASDAQ, which is a positive sign for investors, especially if they expect good news.

Sentiment-wise, the tweet seems to express confidence in the market's upturn and investor expectations. Therefore, it's likely that the sentiment is positive. But I should also consider if there are any negative factors not explicitly mentioned. For example, does the user have information about dividends or other financial details? Since this is just one tweet, I can only go by what's stated.

Putting it all together, the positive aspects of the tweet suggest a favorable outlook on the stock price, so the overall sentiment should be positive."
2015-02-23,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on BABA's stock price. Let me start by analyzing each tweet step by step.

The first tweet says, ""$ baba - hagens berman reminds investors with losses greater than $ 100,000 . 00 of the march 31 , 2015 lead URL."" I'm not entirely sure what this means. It mentions ""hagens berman"" and ""losses greater than $100,000,"" but it's in Chinese. Maybe that's a typo or something? The overall point seems to be about informing investors about losses, so maybe negative.

The second tweet is ""$ bought april 90 calls in $ baba just now."" This sounds like an investor action—buying call options on BABA stock. Buying calls can increase the stock price if the market moves up, which would be positive for the company.

The third tweet says, ""$ cris news updated sunday , february 22 , 2015 7:10 : 45 pm $ baba $ jnk $ xlf $ gdx URL."" The presence of these letters seems random or maybe some typo. It doesn't clarify what's going on with BABA, so it's hard to tell if this is positive, negative, or neutral.

Now, combining the factors: There are mentions of losses and buying options. Losses could be a factor, but since there was a loss mentioned earlier (from 100k down?), it might make investors cautious. However, purchasing calls can also suggest excitement or potential future gains if the stock goes up.

But without more context, like specific dates or more details from hagens berman, it's hard to assess the exact impact. The third tweet is unclear, so maybe it doesn't have a significant effect yet. But the second tweet about buying options could potentially drive the stock higher.

I'm leaning towards mixed because while there are positive signs of action (buying calls), there's also mention of losses which might reduce confidence. However, since it's only just now and no concrete data, maybe it's considered a neutral or slight negative."
2015-02-24,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided a set of tweets and wants an analysis of their likely impact on a company's stock price using three categories: Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

First, I need to understand the process they outlined. They mentioned identifying the target stock from the tweets and then analyzing each tweet as either positive or negative factors. Then, considering how these factors might affect investor sentiment. Finally, combining all this information into an overall sentiment conclusion.

Looking at the first tweet: ""AT_USER your tweet about $ baba had a sentiment of 5 and was featured on market parse . URL"". The word 'sentiment' here is present, but it's unclear what exactly they're referring to—maybe their mood or confidence level? The part before 'was featured' seems like it could be related to how the tweet is structured. Maybe indicating support or something else. However, since the user hasn't provided the stock symbol from this tweet, I can't proceed further with identifying it.

I should note that without knowing which stock is being discussed here, it's impossible to determine its impact on their price. The output required is a single line summarizing the overall sentiment based solely on the given tweets and the stock symbol extracted. Since we don't have the stock symbol from this tweet, I can't give a precise conclusion.

But wait, maybe there's an assumption here that each tweet relates to the same company. Perhaps all these tweets are pointing towards talking about the same stock, like ""BABA"". If that's the case, then I could analyze each tweet as per my original thought process. However, since I don't have information from all tweets provided by the user, it's hard to do a thorough analysis.

I also need to consider the context. If the user hasn't provided several full tweets but has started with one and wants an overall sentiment conclusion, perhaps they're expecting me to make some assumptions or rely on the first tweet for the stock symbol? Or maybe they have more tweets coming up that aren't included here.

In any case, without the stock symbol from this specific tweet, it's impossible to determine its impact. I should probably point out that without knowing which stock is referred to, my analysis can't proceed accurately. Maybe I can ask for clarification or provide an example if the user has more tweets in mind."
2015-02-25,Neutral,"Okay, let me figure out how to analyze these tweets regarding their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided several tweets and wants an overall sentiment summary.

First, I need to extract the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the tweets, they all mention ""baba,"" so I think it's the stock of BABA Inc., which is part of the SPY ETF as per my knowledge base.

Next, for each tweet, I should separate positive and negative factors. However, I notice that some tweets are pretty similar or just repeat others. For example, tweet 2 is a longer version of tweet 1, mentioning multiple companies but focusing on TSLA, TGA, FB, etc., all tied to BABA. Similarly, the other tweets from 3-10 seem to be duplicates, just repeating ""your tweet has been featured"" and asking about the URL.

So, considering the content:
- Positive factors: The mention of a low-interest rate driving the market and potential for a bounce or correction.
- Negative factors: Maybe confusion or repetition, but I don't see any explicit negative points beyond that. It seems more focused on the trend rather than an issue.

Now, assessing sentiment for each tweet. Tweets 1 and 2 are from AT_USER. The first is a long position, suggesting a potential buy. But it also mentions a correction of 10%, which could imply uncertainty or caution. However, since it's about predicting a move back towards 90 against a possible 10% correction, it's still cautiously optimistic.

Tweets 3-10 are just rephrased versions. The main content is the same, but they're repeated multiple times, so no new information here. They don't express any conflicting or negative sentiment beyond repeating.

Putting this together: All tweets are indicating a cautious outlook with a focus on potential corrections but without strong negative indicators. There's some repetition and speculative language but not clear evidence of an overall negative trend or strong positive expectations.

Therefore, the overall sentiment should be [Neutral] because there's no significant shift in opinion towards positive or negative; it's more about speculation and uncertainty rather than a clear direction."
2015-02-26,Positive,"Okay, so I have to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a given company. The user provided some tweets and specified the output should be either [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, let me go through each tweet one by one. 

1. The first tweet says $ hippq closed up 275% as the best penny stock. That's clearly positive news about a company's performance. Penny stocks are usually good for investors because they're cheaper and can be volatile. So this seems like a strong positive sign.

2. The second tweet mentions cross-border e-commerce racing against Alibaba. It looks like there's tension in the market, maybe due to competition. This could impact the stock negatively as other companies might try to gain market share or face competition from larger players. 

3. The third tweet talks about fous 4 dvd being a great day trading show and suggesting checking secrets within it. I know some shows can attract viewers, but since it's not related to a company's performance, this might be neutral or maybe slightly positive.

4. The fourth tweet discusses AT_USER providing premarket updates on the stock prices with significant numbers added. This could give early signals that the stock is moving up or down, which can influence investor sentiment. It seems like this is pushing more investors' attention to the stock, which could be a positive.

5. The fifth tweet says WeChat is affecting Alibaba's Hongbao Wars. I'm not sure what ""Hongbao Wars"" refers to, but if it's a competitive race between companies or platforms, it might affect market dynamics and thus investor sentiment.

6. The sixth tweet mentions an internet thing with fb and baba trading. Again, without more context, this seems too vague to assess as positive or negative. It might be neutral or even speculative.

Now, considering the overall impact:
- The first tweet is a strong positive.
- The second tweet introduces uncertainty but doesn't mention any bad news related to the stock.
- The fourth tweet adds premarket information that could set expectations for the stock's performance.
- The other tweets are either vague or do not provide significant info on the company.

Combining these, the first and fourth tweets give strong positive signals early in the process. However, the second tweet introduces uncertainty about cross-border e-commerce competition but doesn't mention anything bad related to the stock. The fifth and sixth tweets could add more context about market dynamics that might affect investor sentiment, but without clear positives or negatives.

So overall, it's hard to say for sure if the positive factors outweigh the neutral ones from other tweets. But since several points are positive early on, maybe the overall impact is positive."
2015-02-27,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on stock prices.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at them:

1. ""Only AT_USER because of $ baba.""
   - Hmm, this seems a bit unclear and not specific about which company. It mentions $ baba, but without more context, it's hard to pin down. Maybe ""baba"" is a company name.

2. ""$ baba price need to breakout above $87.30 mm's rlb major resistance for higher prices . bounced on rlb support @ $85.21""
   - This one mentions ""rlb major resistance"" and specific stock prices. So, I can assume it's about AT_USER stock.

3. ""AT_USER $ baba your tweet has been featured on market parse , for iphone . URL""
   - Again, similar structure as the first tweet with ""$ baba."" Maybe this is also a tweet about AT_USER's $baba stock.

4. ""$ baba lows and $ yhoo close to lows""
   - This mentions two stocks, $baba and YHOO (which is Apple). So likely AT_USER ($baba) and AAPL (YHOO).

5. ""rt AT_USER $ baba lows and $ yhoo close to lows""
   - Continuation of tweet 4, confirming the same stocks.

6. ""follow me into live stock chat ! $ goog $ pcln $ twtr $ fb $ aapl $ ebay $ gm $ dust $ baba URL URL""
   - More tweets about multiple companies: Google (GOOG), PCLN, TWTR, FB, APLX, EBAY, GM, DUST, BABA. So this is broader.

7. ""$ baba johncm : good ! all of the bad news has been : johncm URL""
   - This is another tweet about $baba and mentions JONCM (which I think is Johnson & Johnson). It seems to critique the company, mentioning they have a lot of negative news.

Now, summarizing:

- AT_USER stock: mentioned in tweets 1,3,4,5. Also, it's related to multiple other companies in tweet 6.
- AAPL (YHOO): from tweets 4,5, and part of a broader list in 6.
- GOOG, PCLN, TWTR, FB, EBAY, GM, DUST: all part of the broader market analysis in tweet 6.

The user is providing information about several companies related to AT_USER's stock. The tweets mention price targets, resistance levels, specific prices, and even negative news about another company (JONCM). They also seem to be pointing out that other stocks may have similar issues or potential issues but are not focusing on AT_USER specifically.

Looking at the structure of these tweets: they're providing information without expressing any opinion or prediction. They're just listing facts about price levels, support for resistance, and a negative note from another company. 

So, since the user is simply providing data points without expressing any positive or negative sentiment towards AT_USER's stock, it seems neutral. The main focus is on other companies' performance, which doesn't directly impact AT_USER's stock outlook.

Therefore, I should classify this as ""Neutral."""
2015-02-28,Neutral,"Okay, let me try to figure out the likely impact on the stock price based on these tweets. First, I need to extract the target stock from each tweet.

1. The first tweet mentions ""china cuts interest rates again in face of weak demand , deflation risk"" and lists several ETFs like $fxi$, $bfu$, etc., along with the stock ticker APL (Amazon). So the stock is probably Amazon,-symbolized as APL.

2. The second tweet talks about ""rt AT_USER lots of new investing research posts up on the site : URL $spy$ gld$ yhoo$ baba$ aapl$ study"". Here, it lists SPY (S&P 500 ETF), GLD (Gold ETF), YHOO (Google), APL (Amazon), and STUDY (Investing). So the target stock is still Amazon.

3. The third tweet says ""alibaba : baba ) gearing up for ant financial ipo in 2017"" with links to BABA (Baidu's ETF) and mentions an IPO on 2017, which was for Baidu. Again, the stock is APL.

Now that I have identified all three tweets as targeting Amazon, I can proceed.

Each tweet lists ETFs like SPY, GLD, YHOO, BABA. These are all ETFs that track major sectors or indices. For example, SPY and YHOO are S&P 500 ETFs, BABA is Baidu's ETF, and GLD is gold ETF.

These ETFs often have a wide range of movements and don't necessarily indicate the stock's direction because they can go up or down regardless of the underlying stock. So each tweet might be showing investor interest in different sectors but not directly influencing Amazon's stock price.

Some tweets mention ""gearing up"" for an IPO, which could mean increased exposure to a certain sector before it expands further. Gearing refers to how much debt relative to equity a company has. Increased gearing often makes the stock more sensitive to interest rates and economic conditions because higher leverage can amplify losses if interest rates rise or the economy weakens.

The first tweet mentions deflation risk, which is about inflation concerns. If demand is weak and deflation is risk, it might affect consumer spending and hence a company's revenue.

The third tweet says there's an IPO on Baidu in 2017, which could boost its stock price since companies with strong earnings and market presence tend to rise after IPOs.

So each tweet has mixed signals. Some suggest increased exposure or potential risks that might impact the stock if things go as planned. However, without specific information about whether these events occur, it's hard to predict a clear trend for Amazon. Each tweet could be viewing APL differently based on their respective factors, but collectively, there's no strong indication of a consistent positive or negative movement.

Therefore, considering all these factors, I'd lean towards a neutral outlook because each tweet presents varied perspectives that don't consistently point to a particular outcome."
2015-03-01,Positive,"Okay, let's break down how I approached analyzing these tweets for their impact on stock price. The user provided a set of tweets and asked me to determine whether they would be positive, neutral, or negative in terms of affecting a company's future stock price.

First, I started by identifying the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking through them, all the tweets mention ""BABA,"" so that must be the stock we're focusing on.

Next, for each tweet, I separated the factors into positive and negative aspects. The key words like ""pull back"" and ""support"" in some of these seem to indicate a potential decline. For example, in the first tweet, it says ""i knew it would pull back ! just look at my nov 8th $ baba post."" This suggests that the stock might be regaining strength or facing some downward pressure.

Then, I considered how each factor influences investor sentiment. The mention of a major support and looking forward to seeing ""u URL"" in the context of November's posts indicates optimism about the company's continued growth potential. Investors are likely expecting more positive developments, which would boost stock price.

I also noted that while some mentions of ""baba"" might imply support, the phrase ""nearing a major support"" seems more decisive for an upward trend compared to vague mentions of support. The expectation of future news and increased visibility probably contribute to a positive outlook.

Overall, combining these factors—positive mentions of growth expectations, anticipation of support, and optimistic outlook—I concluded that the stock is likely to perform positively."
2015-03-02,Negative,"Okay, I'm looking at this query where the user wants me to analyze tweets about a stock's future impact on its price and determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative. The target is [ Positive ] [ Neutral ] or [ Negative ]. 

First, let me go through each tweet one by one. Starting with the first one: ""$ baba fsubcschamps : this stock is about to loose support and : fsubcschamps URL"". Hmm, that's a bit confusing. It looks like they're mentioning $BABA, which I believe stands for BABA stock. The part ""loses support"" makes me think the company might be underperforming or facing some issues. Also, there's a mention of ""fsubcschamps,"" which doesn't make much sense in this context. Maybe it's a typo or something else entirely. Not sure what that URL is related to.

Moving on to tweet two: AT_USER at AT_USER AT_USER charts misses the other ""pe"" bubble. When exits get hard, holders sell stocks like $BABA $TWTR $FB and cash. So here, there are multiple companies listed as ""pe,"" which likely stands for the PEG ratio or something similar related to growth valuation. The tweet seems to suggest that the stock might be moving into a ""PE"" (Price/Earnings) bubble. When exits get hard, meaning when a company stops growing, holders sell off stocks. They mention selling $BABA, $TWTR, and $FB, along with cash. This could indicate investor sentiment is down or they're seeing growth issues that make them sell off assets.

The third tweet: update; alibaba group holding limited short interest grows by 26.1%. So, Alibaba's short interest is increasing, meaning more people are betting against the stock. Short interest usually affects market sentiment but doesn't always indicate a positive outcome for the company. It could mean the company is worried about future growth or some competitive issues.

Lastly, tweet four: rt AT_USER let's see that triple $BABA bottom bitches URL. I'm not sure what this means. Maybe a typo like ""triple bottom"" instead of something else? Not clear. The mention of ""let's see"" and ""bottom witches"" is a bit absurd. Perhaps the user meant something else, but it's unclear.

Now, summarizing each tweet: 

1. The first tweet mentions support loss and a URL that seems irrelevant.
2. The second suggests rising PEG bubble, which might lead to selling off stocks.
3. The third indicates Alibaba's short interest is growing, affecting sentiment negatively.
4. The fourth is unclear but could be a random message.

Overall, the main points are a PEG issue (second tweet) and a concern about short interest (third). These seem like factors that could push investor confidence towards negative. Without more info on Alibaba, it's hard to conclude, but given the lack of clarity in some tweets, especially the third one, I think the sentiment is leaning Negative because both support issues and short interest growth are factors pointing towards a dip."
2015-03-03,Negative,"Okay, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the given company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock from the tweets. The user provided a list, but it's not clear which specific stock they're referring to. Without knowing the symbol or context, it's challenging, so I might need to consider if there's a way to figure this out or if the sentiment is generalizable.

Looking at the tweets, each seems to discuss different aspects related to $ baba. Some mention the success of their stake in BBABA, others talk about the stock performing well or not, some suggest using fake orders, and others provide updates on stock prices or reviews.

I notice several mentions of $ baba being at an all-time low, like tweet 9 and 12. These could indicate that the stock is undervalued. Additionally, tweets like 13 talk about news related to $ baba but don't specify if it's positive or negative.

Sentiment analysis shows mixed emotions across the tweets. Some are positive because of good news, others are neutral with updates or reviews, and some show uncertainty or concern. However, overall trends seem to be a mix—some encouraging, others downcast.

Considering all factors—positive mentions of success, mixed sentiments about performance, negative comments about being underpriced—it's hard to say if the stock is likely going up or not. It might depend on how these trends unfold and any underlying factors that could influence investor sentiment.

So, without a clear majority in either positive or negative, I'll lean towards a Neutral assessment because there are both positive and negative sentiments reflected across the tweets."
2015-03-04,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of BABA (formerly known as TESLA). Let me go through each tweet one by one and see if there's any positive, neutral, or negative information.

1. The first tweet mentions $ gs dropping because of accounting practices and government contracts with China. That sounds like a warning about bad practices, which might lower investor confidence.
2. Second tweet talks about AT_USER on BABA recovering, but it doesn't specify how. It's just a statement without any positive or negative indication.
3. Third tweet says alibaba, gopro, twitter have popped and mentions them going up. That's definitely good news for the market since these companies are known to be strong.
4. Fourth tweet also focuses on alibaba but says they're recovering from fake accounts. Again, no sign of positive or negative impact here.
5. Fifth tweet compares $ baba to $ fb two years back and mentions a trade that led to a fade. This could mean the stock is undervalued because some recent activity has caused it to drop.
6. Sixth tweet talks about YHOO being pulled down by other stocks like $ bac, $ aapl. That's another negative impact since these companies have their own issues.
7. Seventh tweet mentions JD increasing revenue by 73% in Q2014. This is a positive sign because strong revenue growth usually boosts the stock price.
8. Eighth tweet says BABA is undunted by Amazon, Google, and Microsoft but opens first for a cloud center in the U.S. This suggests they're improving or having progress, which is positive.
9. Ninth tweet talks about YHOO's news on the board view. It doesn't mention anything directly related to BABA, so maybe neutral here.
10. Tenth tweet mentions BABA as part of a group holding by Alibaba but no specific sentiment from them.
11. Eleventh tweet says $ baba has been featured on the iPhone parse site. This could be positive if Apple is supportive or negative if Apple has any issues.
12. Twelfth tweet introduces Bobirw with 84.75, but doesn't provide context for BABA's stock price.
13. Thirteenth tweet just mentions $ baba being featured on the iPhone parse site without any sentiment info.

Now, looking at all these tweets, I can see that some are positive about specific companies (like alibaba and jd), others mention issues like government contracts or fake accounts (from AT_USER). There's also a mix of warnings and undervalueings. But overall, most of the information points towards BABA either having good news (recovery, cloud center) or mixed with some negative factors (contract practices, fake accounts). However, there are a few tweets that directly talk about BABA going up by 73% in Q2014 and it being undervalued. But I'm not sure if the significant increase is enough to outweigh the other concerns.

Since many tweets point towards positive news but some mention negative things, but especially considering the significant revenue growth from JD, which might indicate improved profitability or market sentiment, I think BABA's stock is likely in a positive trajectory."
2015-03-05,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets about $baba stock and determine their impact on its future price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

Starting with tweet 1: ""AT_USER AT_USER there are lot's of counter arguments , alibaba is another . $ baba."" This looks like a counterargument tweet, so it's likely not positive or negative; it's neutral because it's just questioning the matter rather than making any claims.

Tweet 2 mentions an acquisition of Beijing TV production house enlight media for RMB 2.4 billion and that BABA becomes the second largest owner. The acquisition is significant but doesn't explicitly state a positive or negative outcome, so I'll mark this as neutral because it's just an event without clear sentiment towards stock movement.

Tweet 3 talks about alibaba stock tanking on a URL linked to $baba. While mentions of a tank could be interpreted as a lack of confidence, the overall impact is unclear without more context, making it neutral.

Tweet 4 states that alibaba is breaking out of a downtrend and lists other stocks like YHOO and YELP for potential breakout. This is speculative but doesn't provide any specific positive or negative indicators, so I'll consider this neutral.

Tweet 5 mentions alibaba entering the U.S. cloud market. Cloud computing could be an indicator of growth, which might lead to a rise in stock price, so I'm leaning towards a positive sentiment here.

 Tweets 6-12 are all just repeating the same tweet and adding more context without any new information or emotions. So they don't affect the analysis much; it's just additional information that doesn't change the overall impact.

Tweet 7 is ""baba nhod""—I'm not familiar with this term, so I can't tell what it means in this context. This makes the tweet ambiguous, which could be seen as negative if there's confusion about its meaning.

Tweet 8 says $baba has risking 84%. Without knowing the magnitude or why the risk is mentioned, it's hard to assess sentiment—could be positive or negative without more info.

Tweets 9 and 10 discuss stock performance indicators like long-term trading strategies. These are informational tweets that might influence technical analysis but don't express a strong positive or negative opinion on $baba.

Tweet 10 talks about bankings trading in $baba for long and short term goals, which could suggest potential growth but doesn't provide clear sentiment.

Tweets 11-21 involve stock news related to alibaba. Many tweets are speculative and without specific data points or strong claims, making them neutral.

In summary, the main positive tweet is number 5 about alibaba entering the U.S. cloud market. Other tweets either repeat events or provide vague information that doesn't give a clear picture of $baba's performance. So overall, it seems like there's some positive sentiment from an exit in a sector but other factors are ambiguous.

I think the overall sentiment is Neutral because while there's a positive event, the rest of the tweets don't support a clear outcome."
2015-03-06,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of BABA. Let's go through each tweet step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. It seems like all the tweets mention ""baba,"" so that's our target stock. 

Next, for each tweet, I should separate the factors into positive and negative. For example, in the second tweet, they mention new penny stocks and early access, which might be positive. The fifth tweet talks about whales betting on Alibaba holding the lockup expiring, which could affect BABA. The seventh mentions YHOO providing a catalyst for selling BABA stock, so that's another positive.

Then, I need to assess the sentiment of each tweet towards BABA. Let's look at them one by one:

1. ""back in $ baba 4000 shares @ 84.10"" seems neutral because it's just a price update without much analysis.
2. ""we have a lot of new penny stock picks coming ! get early access : URL $ segi $ baba $ swet."" This is positive because it mentions upcoming stocks and offers free access, which could increase interest.
3. ""rt AT_USER video URL stk mkt analysis 3/6 / 15 $ spy $ aapl $ qqq $ iwm $ baba $ tlt $ gpro $ tsla."" The keywords include stock market analysis and specific stocks, so this is positive.
4. ""rt $ aapl algos triggered sell in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 08:22 , p / t 125.00 $ goog $ baba $ fb $ nflx $ bidu $ gpro $ tsla hft quant."" This mentions multiple stocks and technical indicators (algos, crossesell, etc.), which can influence investor sentiment positively.
5. ""traders betting on alibaba group holding ltd lockup expiration $ baba URL alibaba."" BABA's expiration could impact its price as the stock might close near a premium or have significant news related to the company's performance.
6. ""$ baba looks to be in process of stabilization . whales went to work this week ."" This sounds positive because it's mentioning the stock being stabilizing and the presence of active investors, which can boost demand.
7. ""but more importantly $ yhoo AT_USER has a catalyst , $ yhoo on march 15th can freely sell $ baba AT_USER stock meaning lots of free cash."" Positive again with information about whales' action that could push BABA up.

Now, for the sentiment summary: all tweets are either positive or neutral. There's no negative tweet, but one is neutral (tweet 1). So overall, it looks like the impact is positive because there's a lot of reasoning and excitement around new stocks, whales' actions, and potential price movements."
2015-03-07,Negative,"Okay, I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually.

First tweet is about a new store launch on Tmall introducing something related to Amazon. That sounds like a positive sign for Amazon because if they're bringing in another store or product line, it might attract more customers or expand their market reach. So this seems like a positive factor.

Second tweet is about the stock symbol being BABA and the URL being $baba. Well, that's just an informational tweet. It doesn't provide any positive or negative content related to Amazon. It just shares the stock name. I don't think this adds much information for assessing sentiment.

Third tweet mentions ""apple"" but with a typo, it says ""amzn"". So maybe someone is referring to another company? But if it's about AMZN, that could be a bit confusing. If they're introducing something related to Apple, which is a competitor, that might affect Amazon's performance negatively because if competitors are doing well, Amazon might struggle. However, if it's a typo and meant to mention Amzn, then it might not have much impact.

Putting this together: The first tweet is positive, the second is neutral, and the third is slightly negative but ambiguous. I think the overall sentiment would be a mix of positive and some minor negatives. So probably a neutral overall impact."
2015-03-08,Missing,File not found
2015-03-09,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price of TSLA. Let me start by understanding each tweet separately.

First tweet says $ baba booey news after close! URL. That sounds like a casual statement about something going wrong with the stock price. It's not extremely positive or negative but mentions that it might be an issue, which could indicate a bearish sentiment. So I'll mark this as Negative because it's suggesting there's something to watch out for.

Second tweet is shake up in the c-suite and they're rattling alibaba shareholders. Rattling means losing market share, which usually happens when companies announce bad news or high-profile moves. That sounds negative, so another Negative here.

Third tweet has multiple mentions of mega caps: highest risk per option market - 1 $ baba 2 $ aapl 3 $ bac 4 $ gild 6 $ fb ... more cml chart --> URL. The mention of ""mega caps"" and multiple stocks involved could imply increased volatility or potential price swings, which might influence investor sentiment negatively.

Fourth tweet is about alerting the trading community on TSLA, GILD, and BABA all are battling lows of the day. Battles low means strong bearish news. This sounds positive in a way because it's indicating that the stock is in trouble, so maybe investors expect a drop. So this could be Positive.

Now combining these thoughts: Two Negative tweets about potential losses (after close and c-suite issues) and one Positive due to battles low. Since there are more negative factors, but also some positive ones, I need to weigh them. The major tweet from the c-suite is the most impactful as it directly mentions shares of a large company, which often signals bad news.

So overall sentiment might lean towards Negative because two of the four tweets suggest potential issues, and while one is positive, the majority are negative. But maybe the Positive tweet has more weight. Alternatively, considering that it's about a mega cap, volatility could lead to mixed emotions. However, I'm leaning towards the c-suite tweet being the main indicator, making this tweet a Negative."
2015-03-10,Neutral,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets about Alibaba's IPO and their impact on stock price trends. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify each tweet as positive or negative based on the given criteria. The user provided five tweets, and they all mention changes in $baba stock. 

1. ""alibaba's ipo sparks celebration in hometown of hangzhou : $ baba"" - This seems like a happy news event. It mentions an IPO, which is exciting for investors. So this should be positive.

2. ""rt AT_USER alibaba shuffles top ranks at shopping platforms to face counterfeit-goods challenge URL $ baba URL"" - The user's tweet talks about Alibaba doing well on platforms but facing counterfeit-goods issues. This could affect investor sentiment because it introduces uncertainty or potential risks, which might make the stock look less favorable. But since it's an event that affects the company's performance and can impact investor confidence, I think this is positive.

3. ""china's central government procurement center moved its official site to alibaba holding ltd ’ s alicloud $ baba URL"" - This seems like a strategic move by Alibaba to update their website or official site. It shows that they're responsive to changes in the market and may attract more users, which can be positive.

4. ""rt AT_USER u . s . , china send conflicting signals on piracy URL $ baba"" - The user mentions sending conflicting signals about piracy. This could be a red flag because piracy is a serious issue affecting the company's reputation. More conflicts might reduce investor confidence and make the stock look negative.

5. ""t3 live daily recap : things that make you go hmmm URL $ spx $ spy $ nflx $ googl $ aapl $ qqq $ xlf $ twtr $ fb $ mbly $ baba"" - This is a general day recap of multiple stock markets. It seems like it's just providing information without any positive or negative keywords.

Now, combining these thoughts: The first tweet is definitely positive because the IPO is an exciting event. The second one has mixed sentiment because while Alibaba did well on platforms, counterfeit issues might lower investor confidence but could also highlight opportunities. The third is somewhat neutral as it's a strategic move that might attract users. The fourth introduces uncertainty about piracy which could have both positive and negative impacts. The fifth is too broad and doesn't provide specific information.

Considering all these, the overall sentiment seems to be mixed. There are some positives like the IPO being announced and the government site update, but there are also conflicting signals about piracy and a general market recap that might not add much. Therefore, I think the overall impact on the stock price is neutral."
2015-03-11,Positive,"Alright, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company and decide whether it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol in all these tweets is ""baba"". That makes sense because the other symbols listed are names that start with 'b', which could be related to BABA stock.

Now, for each tweet, I need to break them down into factors. Factors can be positive or negative, and then assess how they affect investor sentiment. The overall sentiment will come from combining all these individual assessments.

Starting with the first tweet: ""AT_USER and stock will be higher then today . $ baba my prediction only ."" This seems like a quote that's predicting something about BABA stock. It doesn't give much information about whether it's going up or down, but it's more of a motivational statement. I'm not sure if this is positive or negative because it might be fluff without concrete info.

Second tweet: ""rt AT_USER mark your calendar : alibaba's ipo lockup ends march 18 , unleashing 437 million shares URL $ baba"". This looks like a news update about an upcoming IPO. I remember that when companies go public, they usually have high stock prices because investors expect good growth. The fact that it's ending and they're unleashing shares might mean the stock is expected to rise. So this could be a positive factor.

Third tweet: ""$ nmm paying 14.75 % dividend in 5 1/2 week and just broke above 50 dy at 11.94 mv avg with a lot of leg room left . $ hk $ baba $ wmc $ nymt $ orc"". This seems like financial news about BABA. They're reporting a dividend, which is good because dividends increase investor confidence that the stock will go up. Also, breaking above 50 on moving average and having legroom means there's potential for higher price. So this is definitely positive.

Fourth tweet: ""rt AT_USER alibaba to invest in snapchat at $ 15b valuation , AT_USER reports . URL $ baba"". Another prediction about investing in Snapchat stock. It's speculative, but without more context on Snapchat's performance or anything else, it's hard to say if this is positive or negative. It might be a mix of both.

Fifth tweet: ""alibaba short interest rises as lockup expiration nears $ baba URL"". Short interest can affect stock price because if people are selling their shares, especially in the short term, it can push prices up. This seems like positive news for BABA's short interest, so it could be a good sign.

Sixth tweet: ""top o the morn traders ! looking for a strong up day . 10 tickers available for alerts at URL $ spy $ baba $ fb $ tsla $ nflx"". Again, this is about trading and stock alerts. It's more of an update than analysis, so I don't think it adds much to sentiment.

Now, putting it all together:

- The second tweet is positive because the IPO ending could drive up BABA.
- The third tweet is definitely positive with dividends and moving averages.
- The fifth tweet is positive due to short interest rising.

The first, fourth, and sixth tweets are more of fluff or speculative. So the overall sentiment is positive because there's a combination of good news from the IPO, dividends, and short interest.

I should make sure I'm not missing anything. The second tweet mentions the lockup ending, which can be a significant event. The third has specific numbers that hint at strong performance. The fifth shows increased short interest, which typically relates to market sentiment towards buying more shares.

So combining all positive factors except for the fluff tweets, the overall impact is positive."
2015-03-12,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about BABA stock. I'm new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. I look for something like ""BABA"" or similar. Let's go through them one by one:

1. ""rt AT_USER alibaba just invested $ 200m into snapchat . $ baba""
   - Here, BABA is mentioned. It looks like they're investing money in Snapchat.

2. ""is $ baba yukari's company""
   - This seems unrelated because it mentions ""yukari's company,"" not a stock symbol. Maybe a typo or something else entirely.

3. ""rt AT_USER alibaba just invested $ 200m into snapchat . $ baba""
   - Same as the first one, BABA is involved.

4. ""alibaba invests 200 million in snapchat URL $ baba $ snap $ yhoo URL""
   - Here again, BABA and Snap are mentioned. It seems like a typo because it should probably be Snapped instead of Snapchat.

5. ""rt AT_USER why $ baba is investing in snapchat after tencent said it was too expensive URL""
   - Investment reasons here. They're talking about Tencent's cost.

6. ""AT_USER thursday links : financial consumers , $ spy momentum and the paradox of success URL $ yhoo $ lc $ baba $ ndaq""
   - BABA is mentioned, but not as directly as in others.

7. ""why alibaba $ baba is making a $ 200 million investment in snapchat URL""
   - Again, investment details mention BABA and Snapchat.

8. ""rt AT_USER alibaba has invested $ 200 million in snapchat , cnn has learned URL $ baba""
   - BABA involved here as well.

9. ""report : alibaba backing snapchat at $ 15 billion valuation URL $ baba""
   - Again, investment at a high valuation.

10. "" Snapchat may get cash from alibaba URL $ baba""
    - Investment consideration for the company.

11. ""rt AT_USER alibaba just invested $ 200m into snapchat . $ baba""
    - BABA involved again.

12. ""AT_USER what do you think of quixey ? and $ baba round ?""
    - This seems like a personal comment, not related to stock performance.

So, from these tweets, the main focus is on alibaba investing in Snapchat or possibly Snapped (which they probably misspelled) at different times. BABA appears in multiple mentions but not consistently. The reason for investment varies—some companies, some companies seem to be involved or mentioned after investments.

I need to determine if all these tweets are related and if any mention the stock directly. It seems like only a few tweets mention BABA specifically (tweets 1,3,4,7,8,9,11). The rest have ""baba"" but as part of names or unrelated topics. 

From the positive tweets, there's an investment in Snapchat at $200 million, which could indicate a strategic move to expand or network with the financial consumers. The mention of Tencent being too expensive might be a reason why alibaba is investing elsewhere, possibly due to cost concerns.

In the negative tweets, it's not clear; none are directly related except maybe some unrelated comments. However, the lack of direct mentions makes me question if BABA is performing as expected.

For neutral, I don't see much sentiment unless there's a balanced perspective based on multiple factors.

But considering that most investments are in companies linked to Snapchat or financial consumers, which have historically been sectors like fintech and consumer products. If those are generally strong sectors, investing could be positive. However, without specific data, it's hard to say for sure.

Also, the fact that Tencent mentioned being too expensive might affect alibaba's strategic focus elsewhere, but unless BABA is doing well there, the investment isn't necessarily a guarantee of success.

Putting it all together, since multiple tweets mention investments in companies (like Snapchat and financial consumers), and considering they're part of expanding into new markets or partnerships, the overall sentiment could be mixed. It might have both positive aspects with potential gains but also some risks.

But looking back, maybe I overcomplicated it. All these tweets are connected to investing money, which is a common stock买卖 action. Therefore, the overall sentiment would likely be Negative because investing in companies like Snapchat can vary widely depending on market conditions and competitive landscape."
2015-03-13,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to assess the impact of these tweets on the stock price of BABA. Let me start by breaking down each step.

First, the target stock is BABA. Now, looking at each tweet:

1. The first tweet says: ""AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER after lock-up exp . next wk , maybe the time 2 jump in $ baba ?""

I notice some Twitter handles that are misspelled like AT_USER and maybe some abbreviations. Also, it uses a colon (:) instead of a period (.) but doesn't specify which part is missing or what's happening. It says ""after lock-up exp . next wk"" which seems to be indicating the end of a lock-up period and looking ahead to the next week. The tweet mentions a ""maybe the time 2 jump in $ baba?"" So, it sounds like someone is expecting BABA stock to jump up by $2 next week.

I'm not entirely sure about the exact wording or if the symbols are meaningful here. It might be trying to say that they're looking forward to a significant price increase for BABA. Since it's predicting an upward movement, this could positively impact investor confidence and expectations for the stock price.

Looking at the other tweets, there aren't any others provided beyond this one. So I only have one tweet to analyze.

Putting it all together: The tweet is about expecting a jump in stock price next week by $2, which suggests that BABA's stock might go up. This could lead investors to buy more shares or be more confident in the stock, which would generally be a positive impact on the stock price.

However, without knowing how significant this expected jump is or any other potential negative factors mentioned (like market sentiment changing), it's hard to say exactly whether it's a strong positive or not. But since it's just about expecting an increase, that seems like a signal for positive sentiment."
2015-03-14,Positive,"Alright, let me break down how I approached analyzing these tweets regarding their impact on stock prices for BABA.

First, I identified the target stock symbol, which is ""BABA"". Now, looking at each tweet:

The first tweet mentions counterfeit goods and mentions that imitation Apple Watch models are already on sale on BAA's淘宝 URL. This seems like a positive sign because it suggests good product availability and perhaps a perceived improvement in market conditions or company strength. Positive factors here.

The second tweet provides a mix of multiple stock names like $VIX, $USD, $GOOG, etc., which are all technical indices or unrelated to BABA. These tweets don't seem directly relevant to the stock being analyzed. They might be part of broader market commentary but don't provide specific information about BABA's performance.

Considering these points, the first tweet is positive because it highlights a product issue that could positively affect investors by showing availability and perhaps a good opportunity for sales. The second tweet doesn't add any relevant information on BABA, so it's neutral in this context.

Putting it together, with one positive factor out of two tweets, the overall sentiment leans towards positive. Therefore, I categorized this tweet as Positive."
2015-03-15,Negative,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how the given tweets are likely affecting the stock price of a company. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at each tweet separately might be too time-consuming for this quick analysis, but since I don't have specific data on the company or its current state, I'll try to extract as much information as possible from what's given.

The first tweet says: ""march 18th , $ baba lockup expiration date . 437mm shares ( 18 % ) of the company to be sold publicly .""

Alright, so it mentions that BABA will have its stock share count adjusted and that a certain percentage will be sold. The number given is in millions: 437 mm shares. That seems like a significant number, which could affect investor sentiment if they expect the stock price to drop because fewer shares are available. If there's news about the stock being sold, it might cause a sell-off.

The second tweet isn't provided, but maybe it's about earnings or some other metric. Since I don't have information from it, it's hard to assess its impact. However, if there's no mention of positive or negative factors here, it could be neutral unless something in the tweet contradicts my assumptions.

Putting these together, the first tweet is likely a major news event, which might push the stock price lower because the company is about to go public with a significant number of shares being sold. The 18% reduction from 437mm to maybe around 294 million would mean fewer shares, hence selling off.

Without information from the second tweet, I can't make an informed judgment on its impact. So, considering just the first tweet, it seems like there's a negative factor here because of the stock being sold publicly. But since it's not fully provided, my analysis might be incomplete.

Wait, maybe I should consider both tweets together if possible. But without knowing what's in the second tweet, I can't combine them. So perhaps I should focus on the given information and assume that the first tweet is the main point here.

So, combining all thoughts: The tweet about a lockup expiration affecting shares sold publicly suggests there are concerns or expectations of reducing the number of outstanding shares, which could lead to investors selling off their positions, thereby impacting the stock price negatively. However, without more context from the second tweet, it's challenging to be precise.

I think I should proceed with just the first tweet as the analysis since the rest isn't provided."
2015-03-16,Positive,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of a given company. The user provided some tweets and wants me to determine if each is positive, neutral, or negative. 

First, I need to extract the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the tweets, I don't see any direct mentions of specific stocks, so maybe this is tricky. Perhaps each tweet is referring to a different stock symbol? Let's assume that the user meant for each tweet to reference a stock.

Starting with the first tweet: ""AT_USER AT_USER - you would think ... stock has leprosy or something . or just fears of $ baba huge lockup fallout sympathy ?"" It seems more like a comment about fear or optimism regarding a stock, but it's unclear. Maybe this tweet is not directly related to a specific stock.

Second tweet: ""rt AT_USER gonna be some great trading this week in $ baba , lotta trapped shorts , herd mentality always wrong , tune into AT_USER."" This seems more promotional and could indicate positive sentiment as the user is suggesting trading, which might lead to gains. So maybe it's about stock $ baba.

Third tweet: ""rt options scanner shows alibaba $ baba september 95 call option implied volatility increased 1 % to 34."" This clearly mentions a stock called $ baba, specifically Alibaba. The fact that implied volatility went up could be seen as positive news for a stock, especially if it's in the technology sector like阿里巴巴.

Fourth tweet: ""rt AT_USER chinese premier li keqiang suggested fresh stimulus efforts will be launched if needed . alibaba up 3.4 % . $ baba $ yhoo."" This seems to mention Alibaba and $ baba with positive percentages. The user is suggesting stimulus which might be a positive economic factor, leading to stock increases.

Fifth tweet: ""mid-day changers : alibaba group holding limited ( baba ) , top image systems ltd . ( tisa ... - tickerlens $ baba wlst URL."" This mentions Alibaba again and focuses on $ baba. The fact that the user is looking for trading opportunities might indicate positive sentiment towards Alibaba.

Sixth tweet: ""weekend review video ( 3/15 ): $ spy $ iwm $ qqq $ tlt $ aapl $ amzn $ baba $ ebay $ fb $ twtr $ gild $ googl $ pcln $ panw $ tsla URL."" This is a mixed message, mentioning multiple stocks. The presence of $ baba and others in the video suggests that the user is interested in trading these stocks, which could be positive for all of them.

Putting it together:
- $ baba seems to be mentioned across multiple tweets.
- Other companies like Alibaba, Google, Amazon, etc., are also referenced, which might indicate a broader market effect.
- There's an emphasis on ""great trading this week"" and potential stimulus from China, which could translate into positive news for several stocks.

So overall, the sentiment seems positive as there is optimism about upcoming events and suggesting to trade. The mention of economic stimulus in one tweet adds to that positivity. Therefore, I would categorize this as [Positive]."
2015-03-17,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of BABA (BABA). Let me go through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions that Alibaba might see more volatility before the lockup expiration and talks about $BABA's URL. I'm not sure what ""url"" refers to here, but it seems like talking about a stock symbol or something related. That could imply some news about BABA, which could impact its price.

2. The second tweet says that 337 million shares become eligible for sale on Wednesday when Alibaba's IPO expires. This is a significant event because it affects the share count available, so this would definitely influence investor sentiment. More shares available could increase trading volume and potentially affect stock prices.

3. The third tweet asks if Chinese companies will be selling their products in hand. I'm not sure about China and BABA, but this seems like a general statement. If they expect Chinese companies to sell, it might impact the global supply of BABA stock or its performance.

4. The fourth tweet updates that an AT_USER's trading performance is upgraded from normal to outperforming. This sounds like user-generated content or maybe a promotional message. User comments can be volatile and could influence investor sentiment, but without more context, it's hard to say if this will positively or negatively impact BABA.

5. The fifth tweet mentions that viewers are watching for a stock trading list on Tuesday (Tuesdays are usually Fridays), with several stocks listed: $hmy, $cien, etc. This is likely referring to the stock market activity and trading volumes. More trading activity can affect stock prices, especially if it's positive news.

6. The sixth tweet talks about the $BABA March 85.50 call options being offered for a range of strike prices (6.461-1,564). This is related to pricing models and could influence market participants' expectations, which might impact stock price movements. However, this seems more about technical analysis rather than actual performance.

Now, I'll summarize the factors from each tweet:

- First tweet: Maybe positive or negative based on what ""url"" refers to.
- Second tweet: Significant event affecting share count; likely influencing sentiment positively.
- Third tweet: General statement without context; could be mixed but maybe slightly positive.
- Fourth tweet: User comments, possibly volatile but unclear impact.
- Fifth tweet: Trading volume related to stock trading activity; could have a big effect.
- Sixth tweet: Price-related options pricing; affects market dynamics.

Considering all these factors, the main factors that significantly influence stock prices are the IPO expiration (second tweet), trading activity (fifth tweet), and possibly user comments (fourth tweet). While some tweets might provide positive insights (like option pricing), others could be more speculative. However, with a mix of significant events like IPOs affecting share counts and trading volumes impacting prices, it's likely that the overall sentiment is mixed but has potential for both gains and losses.

After evaluating all these elements, I think there's enough to suggest some positive or negative impact, making it neutral."
2015-03-18,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

Starting with tweet 1: It mentions that BABA has hit a bottom and will come back up soon, which is positive. The user also notes it's an earnings growth factor. So, this seems positive.

Next, tweets 2 and 3 talk about the company receiving an upgrade rating after the lockup ends and mention some URL links. These seem like updates or announcements that could positively influence investor sentiment.

Tweets 4 mentions a loss of $84 in value, which is a negative impact. That's pretty significant.

Tweets 5 and 6 also talk about the lock-up ending with large numbers of shares being sold ahead of the Fed meeting. This might indicate positive news about the company's future prospects or financial performance.

Tweets 7 is a note suggesting all insiders won't sell, which could be cautiously optimistic.

Tweets 8 mentions AT_USER again, likely another announcement to boost investor interest.

Tweets 9 and 10 are neutral because they're placeholders for more specific information. Nothing definitive here.

Tweets 11 shows the stock message board was updated on a Tuesday with specific times and URLs, which might indicate new data or updates about BABA's performance.

Tweets 12-14 discuss assets like GILD, AMZN, BABA, etc., indicating changes in trends or company performance. These could be positive if expected to rise.

Tweets 15 is a negative tweet, as the user says $BABA HEAD FAKE!.

Finally, tweet 16 talks about a stock chart showing a breakout and potential fall, which suggests a possible downward trend.

Putting it all together: There are mixed signs. Some tweets are positive (recurring mentions of earnings growth, lock-ups, and assets), while others are negative with the $baba losing value or being mocked as fake. The overall sentiment seems to be in a gray area but leans towards positive due to recurring positive factors like earnings and news about FOMC meetings."
2015-03-19,Positive,"Alright, so I have to analyze these tweets about the stock of BABA (baba) and determine their likely impact on the future stock price. The output has to be one of three categories: Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

First, let me look at each tweet individually to understand what they're saying and how that affects investor sentiment.

Starting with the first tweet: $ aapl $ amzn $ baba $ ... it mentions several stocks like APPL, AMZN, BABA, etc. It says ""short-term problems may continue,"" implying that there might be some challenges in the near future, but still, long-term wins are expected. That sounds positive because it's setting a hopeful tone for the stock despite possible short-term issues.

The second tweet is about BABA selling half its marbles on March 20th and mentioning 86 calls with ""very nice."" This seems like it could impact interest, perhaps leading to an increase in demand or price. It might boost the stock price because more people are buying, but I'm not sure how significant that effect is.

The third tweet mentions BABA's short-term problems continuing but highlighting its long-term potential as a winner. That sounds positive and focused on future growth rather than immediate issues.

Fourth tweet talks about AT_USER news related to news from the user, mentioning oil prices with Greece, Japan, China, etc., but then there are URLs suggesting user accounts or discussions. This could be speculative and maybe not directly affecting BABA's performance.

Fifth tweet discusses BABA holding a group holding ltd and suggests perfect timing for buying. It seems like it might be encouraging buyers to act quickly, which can boost demand and stock price positively.

Sixth tweet says that BABA isn't expected to drop again, and there was a defense message. This is pretty positive because it gives investors confidence that the stock will stay strong, perhaps even rising.

Now, combining all these thoughts: The tweets are varied but mostly focus on potential positive trends or optimism about future growth (like long-term winners) and some speculation about price movements due to news-related mentions. There's a mix of speculative comments with some encouraging.

However, I notice that the second tweet is specific about 86 calls and selling half marbles on March 20th. Selling marbles might imply a specific type of stock or a particular sector related to BABA. It could lead to increased interest but also uncertainty because the timing is specific, which might affect volume.

Other tweets are more general, like short-term issues continuing and long-term growth potential. They suggest that even if there's some uncertainty, BABA has positives in both immediate and future terms.

I need a balanced approach here. The tweets indicate positive outlooks on growth and optimism for the stock, but there's some speculative content related to specific news items. That speculative content can sometimes lead to unpredictable changes in price. However, given that most of the tweets are encouraging about potential positives, maybe the overall sentiment is leaning towards positive.

But I'm not sure if the specific selling marbles tweet alone is enough to outweigh the others. It might influence volume and interest but isn't a direct indication of stock performance yet.

Considering all this, I think the overall sentiment leans towards Positive because there's a lot of optimism about future growth and potential increases despite some speculative elements."
2015-03-20,Neutral,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company called BABA. Let me start by looking at each tweet and understanding what's in them.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from all the tweets. Hmm, looking through the tweets, I see ""segi baba"" mentioned multiple times, so that seems like the stock symbol I'm interested in is SGRI or something similar. Wait, no, actually, the tweet mentions ""segi baba"" which translates to ""let me see you,"" but then in one of them it says ""subscribe here for our new alerts : URL $ segi $ baba $ swet."" Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Maybe ""segi"" is another name or term related to BABA stock? Or maybe it's a typo and should be something else.

Wait, actually, looking again, the tweet says: ""Our penny stock picks gained 500% in 2 months ! subscribe here for our new alerts : URL $ segi $ baba $ swet."" So that includes ""segi"" but not sure what. Maybe it's a typo or an alternative word. Alternatively, maybe it's about the company itself, like SGRI or another symbol. I'll assume that ""segi baba"" is referring to BABA stock and include that as the target.

Now, let me go through each tweet one by one.

1. ""rt marc faber : when indices hit all time high , i take my money and run $ nflx $ goog $ baba $ fb $ bidu $ gpro $ tsla $ aapl $ qqq""

This tweet seems to be from someone, perhaps someone related to BABA or the mentioned stocks like NFLX (T) is Tesla, FB (Y) is Facebook, Bidu (D) is Buy Up, GPro (G) is General Post. Marc Faber might have some investment strategy here.

2. ""alibaba group holding pt lowered to $109.00 at jpmorgan chase & co . $ baba URL""

Here, BABA's price dropped to $109, and JPMorgan's stock (JPM) is mentioned. This could be a bearish event if the company is struggling.

3. ""rt $ qqq algos triggered sell in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 09:35 , p / t 108.00 $ goog $ baba $ fb $ bidu $ gpro $ nflx $ tsla $ aapl hft quant""

This seems like an event where a stock (QQQ) made people sell in several platforms, including Google, Facebook, etc., at around $108. This could indicate a correction or bearish sentiment.

4. ""alibaba : consumers embrace mobile payment devices that offer secure ways for ... URL $ baba""

This tweet mentions that BABA's mobile payments are popular among Alpha_beta (AB) customers. If people are buying more services via mobile, it might drive demand, which could go up if demand is high and supply isn't changing.

5. ""alibaba : microsoft , amazon are friends — not rivals URL $ baba $ msft $ amzn""

This seems like a neutral statement about BABA's relation to Microsoft (MS) and Amazon (AMZ). This could indicate that the company is in a business environment where both have significant market positions.

6. ""our penny stock picks gained 500% in 2 months ! subscribe here for our new alerts : URL $ segi $ baba $ swet""

This tweet talks about BABA's gains and mentions subscribers, but nothing else. The mention of 500% gain might indicate a strong upward movement.

7. ""is alibaba entering the mobile gaming market ? URL $ baba""

This suggests that BABA is considered an investment in the mobile gaming sector by Alpha_beta (AB). If their business is growing, especially in gaming, it could drive demand for their stock.

8. ""$ baba calls 85 stop""

BABA calling a ""stop"" might imply sell pressure or some form of short-term concern, which can affect sentiment.

9. ""alibaba group holding receives consensus rating of “buy” from brokerages $ baba URL""

The tweet says that BABA's broker ratings go up to ""buy,"" indicating confidence in the stock price.

10. ""alibaba finance arm plans management partnership $ baba URL""

This seems like an investment partnership between Alpha_beta (AB) and BABA, which could mean strategic collaboration or joint ventures.

Now, compiling these, let's analyze the factors for each tweet:

- Tweet 2: Price drop to $109. This is bearish.
- Tweets 3 and 4: Sell orders in several platforms at $108 when price was higher. Also mentions mobile payments from Alpha_beta. If demand is high and supply isn't increasing, this could push the stock up.
- Tweet 5: Positive news about Microsoft and Amazon, which are significant companies. This might provide some relief or support for BABA's future.
- Tweets 6, 7, 8, 9, 10: BABA is involved in different sectors. There's sell pressure from Twitter calls (tweet 8) but also investment partnerships (tweets 9 and 10). It seems BABA has some growth potential or strategic moves.

Considering all these factors:
- Price dropped significantly.
- Some positive news about competitors, which might be good for the stock.
- Negative price action in several platforms.
- Strategic investments that could benefit BABA's future.

The overall sentiment seems mixed. There are both bearish news and positive developments. However, the significant drop to $109 is a strong bear signal, but there are signs of growth potential due to strategic partnerships and mentions of mobile payments. The 500% gain in two months could counterbalance that.

I'm leaning towards a mix of mixed sentiment, so I think it's [Neutral]."
2015-03-21,Negative,"Alright, so I need to figure out the likely impact on the stock price of a company based on these tweets. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I have to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at tweet 1: ""$ thcz filings updated saturday , march 21 , 2015 11:03 : 15 am $ baba $ ecig $ auy $ tso URL"". Hmm, that seems like it's related to tech stocks. The symbols like 'baba', 'ecig', 'aux' are all known Taiwanese tech stock tickers, but I don't recognize them as major companies. Wait, maybe 'auy' is 'au' with a typo? That might be 'Autocad' or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a miswritten symbol for an index. This could be confusing because without knowing the exact company, I can't determine its stock performance.

Since the target stock isn't clear from tweet 1, and tweet 2 is just another update on filing, maybe this whole set of tweets is about the tech sector in Taiwan or indices related to it. But without more context, it's hard to pinpoint which specific company we're talking about.

Next, I need to separate positive and negative factors for each tweet. Each tweet seems to be a news item with various mentions like 'baba', 'ecig', etc., but again, without knowing the exact stock or index, I can't assess sentiment accurately.

Assessing sentiment is tricky here because I don't know what these stocks represent or how they might impact the overall market. It could be positive if the updates are good news for a tech company or negative if it's about something that negatively affects their performance.

Overall, without knowing the specific stock and the context of its industry or competitors, it's difficult to determine whether this tweet will lead to a positive, neutral, or negative impact on the stock price. It might be useful to know which sector the stocks are in or any major events affecting the tech landscape around these dates."
2015-03-22,Neutral,"Alright, let's figure out how to approach this query. The user has given me a tweet about buying BABA shares and wants an analysis on its impact on the stock price. They also provided specific steps to analyze it.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at the tweet, there's ""URL URL,"" which doesn't seem helpful. Maybe that's part of another tweet or a placeholder? Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Hmm, maybe the user made a typo or didn't include all the relevant information. But since the output needs to be based on the given tweet, I should focus only on that.

Next, I need to break down each tweet into factors and sentiment. The provided tweet is just one, so how do I assess the impact? It mentions wanting to buy shares but doesn't provide specific details about factors like technical analysis, market trends, economic indicators, etc. That seems incomplete because without context or numbers, it's hard to determine the stock's performance.

But wait, maybe the user intended to include more information in the tweet, such as ""url"" links. But those are placeholders and don't contribute to the analysis. Without that data, I can't compute anything. So perhaps the tweet is incomplete or not relevant for the given task.

Since I have only one tweet, I can't evaluate its impact on stock price accurately. The output requires a conclusion based on all tweets provided, which in this case is just one. Therefore, without sufficient information, I should probably provide a neutral assessment since it's impossible to determine the sentiment from an incomplete input."
2015-03-23,Neutral,"Alright, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine if they'll impact the stock price positively, neutrally, or negatively for a given company. The user has already provided some sample analysis and an output requirement, but now they've given me actual tweets instead of a target stock symbol.

First, let's break down the process step by step. The user mentioned identifying the target stock, parsing each tweet into factors, assessing sentiment, and then combining it all to give the overall impact on the stock price.

Looking at the provided sample tweets:

1. ""another reason for china to love jack ma and $ baba ... huge tax bills ... URL via AT_USER""

This seems to be a link request because of ""URL via AT_USER"". It mentions tax bills, Jack Ma (who is a tech giant), and $ BABA (which I believe is \$226,000 worth of stock). The mention of tax bills and a link could imply investor interest or potential issues with the stock. However, without knowing the target company, it's hard to assess if this affects the stock price.

2. ""another reason for china to love jack ma and $ baba ... huge tax bills ... URL via AT_USER""

This looks similar to the first tweet. It again mentions a link and tax issues. Again, I'm not sure which company this is referring to. It's possible it could be related to China's influence on investing or something else, but without context, it's speculative.

3. ""another reason for china to love jack ma and $ baba ... huge tax bills ... URL via AT_USER""

Same as the first two; again, not specifying which stock this tweet is about. It seems like each tweet might be pointing towards a different company or unrelated information that could influence investor sentiment.

For each of these tweets, I need to extract the target stock symbol. Since none are provided, I can't determine the impact on any specific stock. Therefore, I should consider these as potential links for other companies but lack sufficient context to assess their impact on the given stock.

Without knowing which tweet pertains to a particular company, it's challenging to evaluate whether each tweet is positive, neutral, or negative towards that company. Since no target stock symbol is given, the analysis can't be completed accurately based solely on these tweets. 

I should probably ask for clarification about the specific stock and which tweet corresponds to it. That way, I can determine the sentiment more precisely."
2015-03-24,Neutral,"Alright, so I need to figure out whether these tweets are positive, negative, or neutral in terms of their impact on BABA stock. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock: it's BABA, which stands for Baidu Group Inc. So that's clear. Now, each tweet is analyzed one by one.

The first tweet says: ""rt AT_USER $ fnjn is joining $ baba to invest in a jerusalem venture partners fund developing the next gen . of cybersecurity URL."" Hmm, okay, so there's an employee (AT_USER) from Facebook who is investing in BABA. They're considering dumping the stock and rolling it into another investment. From what I know about social media trends, when companies mention joining a larger company or investing elsewhere, especially in tech that might be innovative, it can attract more investors because they see potential growth. However, this seems pretty vague. It's not necessarily a positive sign because it depends on the specifics of the venture partners fund and whether they have an investment strategy towards BABA.

The second tweet is: ""considering dumping $ baba and rolling that money into $ fb . alibaba just doesn't seem to have their s - - - together."" This one's more about a specific move. It seems like someone is suggesting they're selling BABA, thinking of putting it into Facebook, which has its own stock (FB). The mention of ""s - - - together"" isn't clear, but the sentiment here could be neutral because while there might be some cautiousness, the overall stance on whether this move makes sense to the company or the investor is uncertain. It doesn't necessarily imply a strong positive or negative effect on the stock price.

Putting these two tweets together, the first one shows interest in expanding into a potential tech venture with a vague idea of its impact. The second tweet suggests a sale, which could be seen as a strategic decision rather than an investment. Combined, they don't paint a clear picture of BABA's performance but more about potential actions and investor sentiment.

So overall, it seems like both tweets are indicating cautious behavior or potential moves without providing strong information on the company's health or market position. They're not definitive indicators of positive, negative, or neutral sentiment because there's a lack of context or data supporting these claims."
2015-03-25,Positive,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of the company.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet, it mentions ""sigma-x"" and several other stocks like ""sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx"". Since sigma-x is a well-known tech company in the semiconductor industry, that's likely the target stock.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one to identify Positive (P) and Negative (N) factors. 

1. The first tweet talks about fb algos triggering a buy in several tech stocks like sigma-x, crossfinder, ats, etc. It mentions levels of input from the bulls. This seems positive because it suggests strong buying behavior.
2. The second tweet is similar to the first one, just slightly different in timing but has the same sentiment—strong buying activity.
3. The third tweet mentions a cotization (卖出) in en $83.90, expecting the stock to reach $87. This looks like a positive outlook for the stock, suggesting it's expected to rise, which is good for investors.
4. The fourth tweet talks about short trades on baba and mentions ""home day trading web"". While some of this seems negative because it's about trading strategies, others might be positive in terms of action but could be viewed as bullish or speculative.
5. The fifth tweet also discusses a buy trigger with other stocks and mentions the stock closing around $86. It's a follow-up to the first tweet but doesn't provide additional factors or sentiment beyond what was already mentioned.
6. The sixth tweet updates the ratings for baba, which could influence investor sentiment positively if the ratings improve.

Now, assessing each tweet:
- Each of the first four tweets discusses buy triggers across multiple stocks, indicating strong positive actions from the perspective of investors or traders.
- The third tweet has a outlook, which is positive and supportive of rising stock prices.
- The fourth tweet includes trading strategies but could be both positive and negative depending on context. However, given the other factors, it's likely seen as bullish.
- The fifth tweet just restates information without much sentiment change.
- The sixth tweet about ratings might slightly increase investor confidence, contributing to a positive impact.

Putting this all together, most tweets are supportive of the stock, especially with buy triggers and outlooks. There are mixed aspects in the fourth tweet but overall, the sentiment seems positive."
2015-03-26,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company based on the given instructions. Let me break down each tweet and analyze them step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking through the tweets, it seems like all mentions are related to stocks: QQQ, APLX (which is AAPL), FB, BABA (which is TBA), GPRO, NFLX, SGOF, and SPY. But since the output requirement is to conclude with a single line about one of these, I think they're focusing on one stock, possibly AAPL or QQQ.

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate them into Positive and Negative factors. Then assess the sentiment and combine them for an overall summary.

Let's go through each tweet:

1. The first tweet mentions selling in several stocks like Sigma-X, Crossfinder, ATS, etc., at 09:55 ET with a price target of $103.50. It talks about goog, baba, bidu, gpro, nflx, tsla, fb, aapl, hft. This seems like selling signals or technical analysis indicators.
   
2. The second tweet says AAPL is trading 0.45 below FA/FA and subject to stats arb correction with a target of $124.50. It's about goog, baba, bidu, gpro, nflx, tsla, fb, qqq, hft. Similar selling signals here.

3. The third tweet mentions AT_USER and suggests focusing on FB or BABA stocks. It goes into an idea section and URL hints. This is more of a call to action rather than a sell signal.

4. The fourth tweet asks the user which one they like most between BABA and FB, with a link provided. Again, a call to action without any selling or analysis.

5. The fifth tweet talks about p/td alerts for BA, MU, Lulu, etc., targeting investors' observer today, including options trading coverage calls. This is more about monitoring prices rather than selling signals.

6. The sixth tweet mentions SPY, QQQ, BABA, FB, and others in the charts. It's a general informational tweet without specific actions or sentiment.

7. The seventh tweet talks about BABA being near an 84.30 level with offers to focus on it. It ends with a call for more ideas and a link. Similar to previous calls, not selling signals.

8. The eighth tweet introduces APLX as potentially a bottom pattern with a hammer formation. It mentions seeing closing tomorrow. This seems like technical analysis suggesting potential down moves.

Now, compiling the sentiment from these tweets:

- Selling signals (tweets 1,2,7): These are clear sell orders.
- Technical analysis suggestions (tweets 8 and some calls: 3,4,5,6): Some are speculative buy or avoid suggesting immediate action, others are about price patterns.
- Options trading coverage (tweet 5) and market analysis (tweets 6,7): They're about monitoring but not selling.

Looking at the combination:

Positive tweets include selling signals. Negative would be if someone is trying to take profits or suggest short positions, but since these are technicals, it's more about potential moves rather than direct selling.

The sentiment summary includes some sell orders and a few technical suggestions. The overall impact isn't clear-cut; there are both sells and speculative ideas. It might mean the company could see mixed news but is suggesting options trading or patterns that don't immediately indicate direction.

Therefore, it leans towards [Neutral] as while there's selling pressure, the sentiment remains uncertain without more concrete signals."
2015-03-27,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of the company, and then decide if it's positive, neutral, or negative. The user provided two tweets, and they are about BABA stock. 

First, let me break down each tweet.

The first tweet says, "" $ baba - yahoo boosts share buyback by $ 2 billion - - update URL"". So, BABA is being boosted by a share buyback of $2 billion. Share buybacks can influence investor sentiment in a few ways. They can signal growth, which is good for stock price, but sometimes they might come with dilution if the company doesn't earn enough. I'm not sure how much of an impact this has on BABA's fundamentals right now.

The second tweet says, "" chinese stocks that your portfolio will love : alibaba group holding ltd ( nyse ... $ baba url"". This one is talking about the performance of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which they're highlighting as a company that investors would like. Again, share buybacks can be a sign of growth potential. However, I wonder how Chinese stocks usually perform in terms of market sentiment and their overall impact on the economy.

Looking at both tweets together, BABA is mentioned twice—once as a stock symbol and again under another tweet about Alibaba. Both seem to be positive indicators because they're boosting companies that are attractive to investors. The context around these tweets seems like they're signaling growth or strong performance, which can positively impact the stock price.

I think both tweets contribute to a favorable overall sentiment towards BABA. They suggest future growth and potential for investors, which would likely lead to an upward movement in the stock price."
2015-03-28,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price. The user provided two tweets and asked me to determine if each is positive, neutral, or negative regarding a company's stock.

First, looking at the target stock symbol 'YHOO' because one tweet mentions ""bullish"" about buying a holding in Alibaba Group. That seems positive as it indicates investor confidence. 

Then, the second tweet talks about an options training video on payoff diagrams for several companies like AGEN, AGG, GRCU, ASHR, BABA, RXMD, and TLT. Payoff diagrams can be used to assess risk or potential profit, which is a bit more of a technical analysis aspect rather than sentiment towards the stock itself.

Since one tweet is positive regarding the stock and another is about an options strategy that might influence investor behavior, but not directly pointing out support for YHOO's stock performance. The options training could potentially affect investor strategies, but in terms of stock price impact on the company, it seems neutral because it doesn't specifically mention buy or sell intentions towards the stock."
2015-03-29,Negative,"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to analyze the given tweets about the stock BABA and determine their impact on the future stock price. The output should be either [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative].

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. 

1. The first tweet mentions ""get our alerts quick from our 'Alert' page - URL $ baba $ frtd , $ erbb , $ hemp pennystocks."" It includes multiple stock symbols: $ baba, $ erbb, $ hemp, and others. This is a bit ambiguous because it doesn't specify which one to focus on. I'll note the presence of BABA.

2. The second tweet asks if ""YOO"" (which stands for Yahoo) is better than ""ALB"" (BABA). It includes URLs like $ baba, $ ms, and $ yhoo. Again, it seems broad but mentions YOO.

3. The third tweet says $ BABA gained 2247.20 on February 15th. This clearly points to BABA as the target stock.

Based on this, I can extract the key information: the user is asking whether YOO is a better investment than BABA and mentioning a positive gain for BABA in February. The mention of a positive gain suggests that this tweet supports the idea that BABA might be performing well, which could influence investor sentiment.

Now, considering each tweet's factors:

- **Positive Factors:** The third tweet directly states a positive result related to BABA.
- **Negative Factors:** None are explicitly mentioned in the provided tweets. However, all tweets are focused on the market and investment advice rather than negative indicators.

Combining these, since there are no explicit negative points, but one tweet highlights a potential positive outcome (the 2247 gain), it leans towards a Positive sentiment overall."
2015-03-30,Positive,"Alright, let's break down how I approached analyzing these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of BABA. 

First, I started by identifying the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking through each tweet, I found ""baba"" in multiple places, so that was my target. Next, for each tweet, I separated them into positive and negative factors. Positive tweets usually highlight improvements or favorable developments, while negative ones point towards issues or declines.

For tweet 1, it mentions an ebook about BABA if someone is taking trading to a new level. This seems like a positive factor because having resources like that can boost performance, so I marked it as positive with +5. Then tweet 2 talks about chinese stocks rising and specific holdings in BABA. This is definitely positive for investors, so another +5.

Tweet 3 focuses on specific companies in the tech space: Google, PCLN, TWTR, FB, AAPL, EBIQ, DUST, BABA. While this shows some optimism, it's a mix of both positive and neutral factors because while BABA is doing well, there are other sectors being praised too. So I assigned +3 here.

Tweet 4 discusses BFG offering an agreement with a music company, which seems like a strategic move that could positively impact their operations. This adds another positive factor, so another +5.

Adding up all the factors: positive 20 and neutral 1 gives me an overall positive sentiment of +6, making the stock likely to rise."
2015-03-31,Positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out the impact on the stock price based on these tweets about BABA stock. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. The main ones are $ baba, $ yhoo, and $ aapl for the other companies, so I can ignore those since they're not related to BABA.

Looking at the first tweet: ""2nd day in a row with this edg seller . yesterday had a 10k offer every 0.05 . today a little tougher to read."" It mentions a 10k offer and an upcoming merger, which could indicate that the company is dealing with significant news, possibly affecting investor sentiment.

The second tweet: ""marissa mayer will determine her fate ! URL $ yhoo $ baba merger ipo money bigbusiness."" The mention of a potential merger related to a big business deal could be positive or negative depending on whether it's good news for BABA. However, it seems more like an event that might have strategic implications rather than immediate financial issues.

Third tweet: ""chartguy 89 : 2015 trending stocks : baba +0.10 % stock charts $ baba alibaba group URL."" This is a link to a trending stock and mentions BABA, which suggests an increase in trading volume or interest, indicating potential positive sentiment.

Fourth tweet: ""alibaba group holding ltd ( $ baba ) tapping into fast-growing online drug market - insider monkey URL via AT_USER."" The company is involved in a new market with a focus on a growing sector and mentions insider trading activities, which could be seen as a competitive advantage or a strategic move, leading to positive sentiment.

Fifth tweet: "" $ aapl $ amzn $ baba $ bidu $ celg $ cvx $ fb $ fslr $ gild $ gld $ gmcr $ goog $ googl $ gpro $ gs $ iwm $ lnkd $ nflx $ pcln $ qqq $ sbux."" This is a list of other stocks. No mention here seems relevant to BABA, so I'll skip this for now.

Now, summarizing the factors and sentiment:
- Day 2 with edg seller might indicate some challenges or management issues.
- 10k offer suggests potential cash flow or earnings.
- Merger related could be either good or bad depending on context.
- Stock trading volume up indicates investor interest.

Assuming that the merger-related tweet is positive, it might signal good news for BABA. The insider monkey link shows strategic growth opportunities, which adds to the confidence in the stock price. Positive factors from the merger and strategic moves seem outweighing any potential negatives like tough days or management issues, leading to a net positive overall sentiment."
2015-04-01,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of BABA. 

First, I need to identify each tweet's target stock symbol. Let's go through them one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) investing $15 million in an Israled venture capital fund. This seems like a strategic move, which could positively impact the company if it leads to growth opportunities or cost-cutting measures.

2. The second tweet talks about BABA signing a distribution deal with BMG, its first music partner outside Asia. A new business relationship can attract more customers and potentially increase sales, so this is likely positive for the stock price.

3. The third tweet mentions that BABA's puts were not as expected in the last hour. This could indicate some volatility or lack of significant changes in their financial performance. However, it might also signal a defensive position if they're trying to mitigate risk by selling some shares before more signs come out.

4. The fourth tweet lists several stocks: NFLX, AMZN, YELP, PADD, IBM, LULU, BABA, FB, PI R, ASNA. This is quite broad and includes multiple unrelated companies. The presence of these stocks suggests diversification but doesn't directly indicate a clear direction for BABA.

5. The fifth tweet discusses Google (GOOG) and Janet Yellen's comments about an IPO. Google is a big player in the tech industry, so this could be a significant event that might drive BABA's stock price, especially if there are synergies or shared resources between them.

6. The sixth tweet again mentions BABA building the Alibaba ecosystem one piece at a time. This sounds like strategic expansion and innovation, which can positively influence the company by enhancing their product offerings or market reach.

7. The seventh tweet states that Alibaba is likely to choose Seattle for its US headquarters. This could have long-term implications if they move away from other locations, potentially affecting operational costs or market access.

8. The eighth tweet cuts the price target of BABA from $112 to $105 at American Express (AMEX). A reduction in the price target can affect investor sentiment and expectations about the stock's future performance.

9. The ninth tweet lists several stocks: AAPL, GPRO, BUDU, SPY, TSLA, BABA, TWTR, BBRY. Again, this is a mix of unrelated companies, which might indicate some diversification but doesn't directly suggest anything for BABA.

Now, looking at the factors and sentiments:

- Positive Factors: The first tweet about investment in a VCF could be seen as strategic, positive. The sixth tweet's focus on ecosystem expansion is also positive. The third tweet hints at avoiding speculation too early, which might signal cautiousness. The eighth tweet cutting price targets could indicate investor confidence moving away from the stock.

- Negative Factors: The second and fourth tweets are unrelated. The fifth tweet about Google's IPO seems positive but a bit speculative. The seventh tweet doesn't mention anything negative related to BABA. The ninth tweet is unrelated as well.

As for sentiment, while there's some speculation about Google's IPO and Alibaba's US location choice, the other factors like strategic investments, ecosystem expansion, and diversification are more concrete. The price target cut might indicate a cautious view but not necessarily all bad.

Putting it all together, while BABA faces some positive signals in their strategic moves, ecosystem expansion, diversification, and speculative events, there's no clear overall negative impact from the provided tweets. It seems more like they're looking towards diversification and long-term growth strategies rather than immediate negative developments."
2015-04-02,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and figure out if they're positive, neutral, or negative for the stock price of a company. Let's take it step by step.

First, looking at each tweet, I should identify which companies are mentioned because that will help me know what's in play. The first tweet mentions QQQ, SIGMA-X, CT finder, ATS, LX, and several other stocks. It also includes dollar signs and some URL links like ""p/t"" which probably indicates price-to-trend or something.

The second tweet is about WYNN filing updates on April 2, 2015. The third one is about US STOCK Forum updated on April 1, 2015. The fourth tweet mentions Marissa Mayer's fate related to a merger with IPo money in big business. The fifth tweet discusses reviews of TSLA (Time Series)?

Now, I need to consider the potential impact each could have. For example, QQQ is an index ETF, so changes in its performance might indicate broader market trends. If it goes up, that's positive; if down, negative.

WYNN filing updates can affect earnings and stock price, especially if they're about financial companies. Marissa Mayer being involved in a merger might have strategic implications for the company, but I'm not sure how immediate or impactful that is on the stock price. The reviews tweet seems less relevant unless it's something unusual affecting sentiment.

I need to analyze each tweet's factors and their impact. But some tweets don't directly mention specific stocks, so maybe they're more about broader market events. Without knowing the exact company or context of the tweets, it's tricky. 

Since I don't have real-time data here, I can only make educated guesses based on the information provided. Maybe the QQQ changes are indicators for the overall market, but without seeing the price movement, it's hard to say if they're positive or negative.

Overall, considering all these factors and the limited context, I think each tweet's impact is somewhat neutral because while some mentions of stock movements might give a sense of the market, others don't provide concrete data on how they'll affect the stock. So I'm leaning towards a Neutral sentiment."
2015-04-03,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided two tweets and wants me to assess them in terms of Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

First tweet: ""$ baba : alibaba group holding ltd ( nyse : baba ) and xiaomi to team up ... : URL"". Hmm, ""baba"" is the stock ticker for Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. The mention of ""team up"" suggests strategic collaboration with Xiaomi, which is a well-known company in the Chinese market, especially known for its mobile devices.

Looking at this tweet, it seems like a potential news about a partnership or merger between two major tech companies. Tech stocks can be volatile because of their high valuation and strong fundamentals. However, if there's positive news about innovation, collaboration, or growth, that could positively impact the stock price. But I'm not sure if this is a huge event or just a minor update on an existing project.

Second tweet: ""looking for stocks to buy and hold ? our top three picks are $ baba $ aapl and $ ba URL"". Here, again ""$ baba"" is mentioned multiple times. The mention of Apple (AAPL) makes me think of potential acquisitions or investments in Apple as well. Apple has been a major player in the tech sector, especially with its ecosystem.

So both tweets are focusing on ""baba"" stock and mentioning other companies like Xiaomi, Apple. This indicates that the sentiment is positive because these are areas where investment and growth have been strong. Investors often look for positive news related to their target stocks, which can boost their stock prices. However, it's also important to consider context—does this relate to new developments, partnerships, or potential expansions?

I'm leaning towards a Positive sentiment here because the tweets seem to highlight opportunities in collaboration and expansion into other sectors like Apple, which is a significant player. The user might be encouraging investors to take action by purchasing ""baba,"" leading to an increase in stock price."
2015-04-04,Positive,"Alright, I need to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of BABA. Let me start by parsing the information given.

First, I see a tweet where someone mentions platinum members saw gains in penny stock over 1400% in four months and encourages them to go platinum. The symbols mentioned are $segi$, $baba$, and $swet$. Hmm, these seem like technical stock symbols. So the target stock is BABA.

Now, looking at the tweet: ""platinum members saw penny stock picks gain over 1400 % in 4 months ! go platinum : URL $ segi $ baba $ swet"". The phrase ""penny stock"" likely refers to BABA, so that's a positive indicator for the company.

The user is encouraging others to go platinum. I'm not sure what ""go platinum"" means here—maybe it's about purchasing more shares or something else? It might be a call to action, which could indicate confidence in the stock's performance or expectation of higher growth.

Next, the tweet includes some URL indicators: $segi$, $baba$, and $swet$. These are specific stock symbols. So the user is pointing to BABA as well. 

Looking at the factors: Positive mentions are about gains (1400% over 4 months), the ""go platinum"" call, and the BATAWKBIB (I think that's a typo for BABA). The negative part isn't present here.

Sentiment-wise, the tweet seems positive because it's highlighting strong performance in the stock. The encouraging phrase about going platinum might be seen as supportive or optimistic. 

Combining all these factors—positive performance and the call to action—it leans towards a positive impact on the stock price."
2015-04-05,Neutral,"Alright, let me figure out how to analyze these tweets about stock prices. So, first, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER something crazy 4 my followers who trade $ spy $ iwm $ tsla $ fb $ aapl $ pcln $ twtr $ baba $ yhoo $ gpro $ tlt $ gld $ gdx URL"". Hmm, it looks like several company names are mentioned. Maybe the main one is ""spacemc"" or something else? Wait, no, I think it's just the user mentioning several companies. So maybe the target stock isn't clear from the tweet alone.

The second tweet is ""AT_USER $ baba your tweet has been featured on market parse , for iphone . URL"". This one seems more concrete. It mentions ""baba"" and mentions that the tweet was featured, but it's not a specific stock name. The mention of ""for iPhone"" might be part of the context or link to something else.

Now, the user asked me to conclude with a single tag: [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Since I can't identify the target stock from either tweet, maybe I should consider that it's about market sentiment rather than specific stocks. But the output requirement is to determine if the overall impact on the future stock price is positive, neutral, or negative.

Looking at both tweets together: The first mentions multiple companies but doesn't specify which one they're referring to. The second tweet talks about ""baba"" and links it to iPhone, but again, that's not a stock symbol. So maybe the overall sentiment isn't clearly determined by these tweets alone. Therefore, perhaps I should consider that without identifying the target stock, I can't conclude its impact on a specific stock price.

But wait, in the user's instructions, they provided two separate tweets, so maybe each tweet is about a different company or related to different companies. Since neither tweet clearly points out a target stock symbol, it's ambiguous whether these tweets are influencing the stock of a particular company or not. Without more context, I can't assess their impact on any specific stock.

However, if I have to make an educated guess, maybe the presence of positive mentions like ""spacemc"" and others could be seen as encouraging investment in those companies, but without knowing which one is the target, it's hard to say. The second tweet about ""baba"" might imply some underlying sentiment towards tech stocks or the company itself.

But since I'm supposed to conclude based on these tweets alone, maybe I should consider that both are positive because they're related to the stock market and user engagement. But without knowing which stock is being referred to, it's a toss-up between positive and neutral. Alternatively, perhaps the overall context implies a general positive sentiment towards stocks.

Alternatively, maybe the user is pointing out that these tweets are encouraging users to follow other users who trade certain stocks, implying a cautious approach. That might be seen as negative by some investors because it suggests a lack of confidence in stock prices.

But without knowing exactly which tweet refers to which stock or the specific companies mentioned, I can't give a precise answer. However, given that both tweets are related to the stock market and user engagement, maybe the overall sentiment is positive but uncertain about the exact impact on any specific stock."
2015-04-06,Neutral,"Alright, let's break down the problem step by step to determine the impact on the stock price.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets provided. The user mentioned ""rt AT_USER something crazy 4 my followers who trade $ spy $ iwm $ tsla $ fb $ aapl $ pcln $ twtr $ baba $ yhoo $ gpro $ tlt $ gld $ gdx URL."" It seems like the stock symbol is either ""spy"" or one of the other options. Since ""spc"" is commonly used for spy, I'll assume that's the target stock.

Next, I'll analyze each tweet to extract positive and negative factors. Each tweet contains various stocks separated by spaces, which are likely indicators of investor sentiment towards those stocks. However, looking through all the tweets, none seem particularly positive or negative about ""spy"" directly. They mention things like ""f traders $ spy,"" which might imply a trade but not specific information about the stock itself.

Now, evaluating each tweet's sentiment toward ""spy"": Each mentions other stocks, which could be interpreted as market reactions to news related to those companies. Since none of these tweets specifically mention anything positive or negative about spy, it's challenging to determine their direct impact on its price.

Considering that the user has multiple tweets and doesn't provide a clear indication of positive or negative sentiment towards ""spy,"" I can only make an educated guess based on the context provided. Without explicit information about spy trading or performance, it's safer to assume neutral. This is because there's insufficient data to confidently label the impact as positive or negative."
2015-04-07,Neutral,"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company, specifically BABA. The options are Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

First, looking at the tweet: ""$ baba $ bery $ dtsi $ ensg long swing ideas if and only if they go thru yday's high URL"". Hmm, that seems like a combination of terms related to stock names, possibly some kind of idea or trend. The word ""long swing ideas"" makes me think that the author is considering whether BABA should be held for a longer period. But I'm not sure about the exact context here.

Now, looking at the second tweet: ""alibaba group holding limited analyst rating update - tickerlens $ baba alibaba , baba URL URL"". This seems to be an update from Alibaba regarding their employees' ratings and has some links or URLs. This could indicate that stakeholders are concerned about the company's performance.

Putting both together, it appears that the tweets are discussing potential stock moves, specifically around BABA. The first tweet is a bit vague but mentions a long-term strategy, while the second one updates an analyst rating which might impact investor sentiment positively or negatively depending on their expectations.

Considering these factors, I'm leaning towards a [Neutral] because they're dealing with speculative ideas and can be influenced by various news events. However, since there's an analyst update from Alibaba, that could suggest some positive movement as stakeholders care about the company's performance."
2015-04-08,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about BABA stock and determine their impact on the stock price. I'm not too familiar with financial analysis, but I'll go through each tweet step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet: ""alibaba proposes asset injection for ailing film arm URL $ baba"". Hmm, BABA must be Alpha Business Technologies or something related since it's often used in tech abbreviations with B.

Now, I have to analyze each tweet one by one.

The second tweet is from RT AT_USER and mentions several stocks: Aapl, Tsla, Twtr, Fxi, Dwti, Uwti, Myl, BaB. The quotes are about sentiment indicators like topiqueticking and a certain date 2015040 8. I'm not sure what that means, but the word ""topiqueticking"" is pretty common in stock trading, which might indicate investor interest or expectation.

The third tweet says: ""even if you miss a push over $ 85 next key resistance just under 86 ( 85.82 ) at 50day sma but not a bad place to scale in baba AT_USER"". This seems to be making a prediction about the stock, suggesting that BABA might be on a potential rise, and it's near a key resistance level. Resistance levels are important in technical analysis as they can indicate potential price action.

The fourth tweet is: ""AT_USER did you say $ baba found a floor or hit the floor ? ? lol just kidding ! time will tell . :)"" It looks like someone from AT_USER is asking if BABA has reached a floor, which is typically a support level. If they're implying that BABA might not go lower again (since ""floor"" is short for floor price), this could be indicating some uncertainty or doubt about the stock's trend.

Now, combining these factors: The first tweet isn't giving specific information but suggests an asset injection in their film arm, which might indicate a positive move. But then BABA is mentioned with predictions about resistance levels and investor sentiment. The third tweet is more about potential price action, while the fourth adds uncertainty or doubt.

The overall sentiment seems to be mixed. There are hints of both potential positive indicators (like asset injection) and some negative expectations due to BABA's possible resistance level and investor comments suggesting they might not go lower. So, it's a mix that leans towards caution."
2015-04-09,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on stock prices for a given company based on the provided output format. Let's go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet mentions $ baba 87.50 looks good. It seems like an informational tweet with some context but doesn't provide specific directions or data, so it might not have much impact yet.

2. The second tweet compares several stocks: $ twtr vs. $ baba vs. others. It's a comparison without any positive or negative indicators, just an analysis of multiple companies. This is more about market trends than stock movements.

3. The third tweet talks about Alibaba entering the mobile e-commerce and search market with AT_USER as a key player. This could indicate strong growth potential for the company, suggesting a positive impact on the stock price.

4. The fourth tweet states that $ baba maintains its dominance in mobile e-commerce through investments and acquisitions. This shows sustained growth and positive outlook, which would likely be a boost to the stock.

5. The fifth tweet mentions RT joining a project with AT_USER to set up a new index in China, focusing on online finance. This is another indication of potential growth and could positively affect the stock price.

6. The sixth tweet updates the price of $ qqq relative to several sectors. It's more about market data than specific actions affecting the stock. Still, it might give some context but not a clear signal for sentiment.

7. The seventh tweet compares $ amzn vs. $ baba with a ""crazy chart"" URL. While comparing companies can show trends, this tweet seems to be more of an update on recent market conditions rather than specific actions impacting the stock.

8. The eighth tweet lists several ETFs but doesn't provide any direct information about the stock's performance or impact. It's more about asset management than affecting the main company's price.

After analyzing each tweet, the key ones are the third and fourth tweets showing strong growth and sustained dominance. These positive factors likely indicate a good outlook for the stock. However, I'm also noticing that some tweets provide market trends (like comparisons in tweets 2 and 6) which could be relevant but might not directly impact the stock's price as strongly.

Considering all this, the overall sentiment seems to be positive, especially with the emphasis on growth potential and sustained dominance by $ baba. Therefore, I'll conclude with a positive overall sentiment."
2015-04-10,Negative,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to figure out their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol isn't provided, but from the context, it seems like it's related to tech or maybe financials because there are words like TSLA, FB, TWCX, etc., which I recognize as Tesla, Facebook, and TWCX being another name for XOM (Corning Inc.), a chemical company. 

Looking at tweet 1: ""follow and send me a dm to get access to sunday night strategy session webinar free ! $ tsla $ fb $ twtr $ nflx $ gpro $ baba $ yhoo"" Hmm, this is directing the user to a webinar on Sunday about TSLA, FB, TWTRX (which is TWCX), NFLX, GPRO, BABA, and YHOO. It's promoting multiple stocks, but since it's just an announcement without any positive or negative language, I'm not sure if this significantly affects the stock price.

Tweet 2: ""rt AT_USER something crazy 4 my followers who trade $ spy $ iwm $ tsla $ fb $ aapl $ pcln $ twtr $ baba $ yhoo $ gpro $ tlt $ gld $ gdx URL"" This seems like it's related to trading with friends, but without any positive or negative language. It might be just a casual mention of stocks being traded by traders.

Tweet 3: ""$ baba they might actually do well on earnings . i mean how is it that the chinese stock market is melting up if things suck so bad ? :"" This tweet expresses a belief that BABA (which I think is BGR) might perform well, but without any indication of good or bad news. It's more of an opinion piece, possibly for someone who expects good results from the company.

Tweet 4: ""$ baba : brokerage firm price target on alibaba group holding limited : URL"" This seems to be a promotional tweet from a brokerage firm targeting ABLN (Alibaba Group Limited) and mentions their holdings. It's just another announcement without positive or negative sentiment.

Tweet 5: ""$ baba descending through support levels like a knife through butter . now below its 40 day sma of 84.55 ."" This is talking about the stock price movement, indicating it's dipping below its 40-day moving average. If the trend is downward and below the MA, that can be seen as bearish.

Tweet 6: ""$ baba trading summed in one word : pathetic"" The word ""patrol"" could mean both good or bad, but here it seems to indicate low stock performance. It's a casual way of expressing disappointment about BGR's performance.

Tweet 7: ""$ baba bo then retest of 50ma , like over 87"" This suggests that the stock is expected to test above its 50-day moving average, which is often seen as an indicator of potential upward movement.

Tweet 8 and 9 don't seem relevant.Tweet 8 mentions a report by a billionaire hedge fund managers, but I'm not sure if that's related to BGR. Tweet 9 talks about Chinese stocks rising after an overnight rally, possibly unrelated unless it ties back to BGR's performance.

Putting this together: Tweets 5 and 7 suggest BGR could be on the rise or may test above a key MA, which are bearish signs. Tweet 6 is more of a negative note. The others don't provide clear sentiment. So overall, there seems to be mixed signals but leaning towards potential downward moves."
2015-04-11,Missing,File not found
2015-04-12,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on TSLA's stock price. The user provided two tweets and asked me to determine if they'll positively, neutrally, or negatively affect the stock.

First, looking at the first tweet: "" $ aezs opinions updated saturday , april 11 , 2015 9:10 : 34 pm $ gs $ tsla $ celg $ baba URL"". This seems like an unrelated link. The mention of April 11th and the time doesn't seem to relate to TSLA or any stock. So, this tweet probably isn't relevant for predicting the stock performance.

The second tweet is: ""An analysis of [something]. [url]"" which again, looks like a link without any content related to TSLA. So both tweets are either irrelevant or contain links that don't provide information about the company.

Since none of these tweets offer any insight into how they'll affect TSLA's stock price, I can't make an assessment. There's no positive or negative information here. Therefore, my conclusion is [Neutral] because there's no evidence from the provided tweets to suggest a change in the stock market."
2015-04-13,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze the given tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of the company. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll extract the target stock from each tweet. The first tweet mentions ""baba"", so that's the stock we're focusing on: BABA.

Next, for each tweet, I'll separate them into positive and negative factors. Positive tweets are likely to boost investor sentiment, while negative ones might hinder it. 

Looking at the tweets:
1. The user is talking about a buy call with $90 and mentioning ""acting really lousy."" This could be seen as negative because of the call, but the trailing comment seems dismissive.
2. A financials update on Monday afternoon: April 13th. While updates can affect stock prices, it's neutral because they are just news events.
3. The tweet is a video summary about various stocks, which might not directly relate to BABA, so no factors here.
4. Talks about connections between options and earnings, but again, this is a general statement without specifics on the company.
5. A mention of real estate financing in China with potential partnerships could be positive if it leads to growth.

Now, assessing sentiment for each tweet:
1. The call and dismissive comment are negative factors, so overall negative.
2. The financial update is neutral because it's just news.
3. No specific factors related to BABA here.
4. Mentioning earnings but no specifics on the company or stock.
5. Positive potential for growth due to the partnerships, which can be a positive factor.

Combining these, while some tweets have negative elements like calls and financial updates, there are also positive factors pointing towards growth. However, the dismissive comment in tweet 1 is significant enough to lean the sentiment toward negative overall. But considering the context of talking about real estate financing, which might indicate a broader sector trend, it's possible that this could lead to positive developments for BABA.

After evaluating all tweets, the net effect seems mixed but leaning towards some potential positives. However, with one clear negative tip, I think it leans more toward [Neutral] as the overall sentiment."
2015-04-14,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of BABA, which is also known as BetaBar Inc. The user has provided five tweets, and they each have different points about the stock. My task is to figure out if each tweet is positive, negative, or neutral in terms of its effect on BABA's future stock price.

First, I'll start by looking at each tweet one by one and try to understand what each is saying and whether it's reinforcing positive, negative, or no opinion about the stock. 

1. The first tweet says: ""rt AT_USER 30 min look for $ baba . still very much like the setup here . current levels need to hold however . URL."" This seems like a personal message encouraging the user to focus on BABA's price. It mentions looking for the stock and indicates that the current level needs to be held, but it doesn't specify if this is positive or negative. So I'm not sure about the sentiment here—it might be neutral because it's just a suggestion without clear reasoning.

2. The second tweet: ""rt AT_USER new startups are being created by former employees of alibaba , tencent and baidu : URL $ baba URL."" This one seems to suggest that BABA is creating new companies, which could imply growth or innovation in the sector. However, I'm not sure if this directly affects BABA's stock price positively or negatively. It might be a bit speculative but probably considered neutral since it's making a general statement without specific data.

3. The third tweet: "" $ baba once a turd , always a turd … dirty stock …"" This is pretty dark and says that BABA is often referred to as ""dirty stock."" I've heard of ""turds"" in internet slang, so this could be interpreted as negative news. It's a bit subjective though because it uses colloquial language without specifics about the stock's performance.

4. The fourth tweet: ""rt AT_USER early movers : $ jpm , $ dd , $ nsc , $ baba , $ wfc , $ jnj"" This lists several companies that are considered early movers in the market, including BABA. It suggests that these companies have a strong presence and could potentially drive changes in BABA's stock price. So this seems like positive information because it indicates confidence or expectation of good news for BABA.

5. The fifth tweet: "" $ vix $ usd major indices $ goog $ pcln $ twtr $ fb $ aapl $ ebay $ gm $ dust $ baba URL URL"" This mentions the VIX index, major stock market indices (GOOG, PCLN, TWTR, FB, APAL, EBay, GM, DUS, BABA), and other ETFs. The VIX is often seen as a gauge of market volatility and fear, which can impact stock prices. However, without specific information on how these indices are affecting BABA, it's hard to say if this is positive or negative. It could be either but seems more about the overall market environment rather than directly affecting BABA.

Now, I need to summarize the sentiment for each tweet. 

- Tweet 1: Neutral because it's a personal message without clear sentiment.
- Tweet 2: Neutral as speculative about BABA's performance.
- Tweet 3: Negative due to the dark term ""turds"" used.
- Tweet 4: Positive because early movers are expected to impact stock changes.
- Tweet 5: Neutral since it talks about market indices but doesn't specify on BABA itself.

Adding them up, we have three neutrals and two positives. The overall sentiment seems positive with two positive tweets outweighing the others, especially since the third tweet is a bit of a guess but considered negative. So, overall, I'd lean towards a Positive overall sentiment."
2015-04-15,Positive,"Okay, let's tackle this analysis step by step. First, I need to figure out the stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at the tweets provided:

1. The first tweet mentions $ twtr vs. $. It seems like it might be Twister Technology (TWTR), which is a company in the tech sector.
2. The second tweet talks about a correlation coefficient of 0.95 between $ baba and $ yhoo over five months, but there's a mention that Marissa called in sick from December. This could imply a positive or negative sentiment depending on context, but not sure yet.
3. The third tweet mentions various stocks like $ goog, $ pcln, $ twtr, etc., which again points to TWTR and possibly others. It also includes links, which might be promotional.
4. The fourth tweet is about new startups created by former employees of Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu, so it seems like a positive note.

Now, I'll analyze each tweet separately.

1. **$ twtr vs. $.** This is the primary stock. There's no explicit sentiment mentioned beyond its symbol.
2. **rt AT_USER correlation coefficient between $ baba and $ yhoo over the last five months is . 95 . if marissa called in sick since decem …**
   - The positive part is the high correlation, which could indicate a favorable view. However, the mention of Marissa calling in sick might suggest uncertainty or dissatisfaction.
3. **follow me into live stock chat ! $ goog $ pcln $ twtr $ fb $ aapl $ ebay $ gm $ dust $ baba URL URL**
   - The link to several stocks and mentions of live chat could indicate investor interest, but not sure about sentiment yet.
4. **rt AT_USER new startups are being created by former employees of alibaba , tencent and baidu : URL $ baba URL**

Now, combining these thoughts:

- **Positive:** High correlation between two tech stocks (baba and yhoo) is a strong positive indicator.
- **Neutral:** Mentioning Marissa calling in sick might be minor but could reflect investor caution or uncertainty.
- **Negative:** The lack of explicit negative information except for the call to action link isn't enough.

I think the overall sentiment leans towards [Positive] with some nuance from the third tweet, but the main points are positive. The correlation suggests favorable expectations, and the fourth tweet is a positive note about startups."
2015-04-16,Neutral,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of Encog PLC. I remember from my studies that stock market analysis often involves looking at news related to companies, their financial performance, industry trends, economic indicators, etc.

First, I need to identify the target stocks mentioned in each tweet. The first tweet is about two companies: Encog PLC (esv), Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (baba), and Apple Inc. (apple). The second tweet talks about a penny stock named ""penny"" with ticker symbol $segi, which seems like an investment account or something similar.

Looking at the first tweet: it mentions Encog PLC as ""best stocks"" and ""alibaba group holding ltd."" It also says they gained 311% in the past two weeks. That sounds really good news for the company. High growth percentage can be a strong indicator of positive earnings or market reactions, which could boost stock prices.

Now, the second tweet mentions a penny stock and talks about gaining value (gaining value $baba $swet). The word ""penny"" usually refers to low-value assets like retirement accounts. The mention of ""gaining value"" might mean that investors are considering buying back shares or using the funds for other purposes, which could indicate cautious behavior rather than optimism.

But I need to break this down step by step as per the process outlined. 

Step 1: Identify the Target Stock. Each tweet mentions several stocks. The first two tweets target Encog PLC and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., while the second tweet refers to a penny stock, which is ""penny"" (segi). I don't have exact information on these companies, but since the first tweet talks about high growth percentages for Alibaba and the outlook for Encog, it's likely that these are positive signs.

Step 2: Tweet-by-Tweet Analysis. 

First tweet: The user mentions Encog PLC as ""best stocks"" which is a strong positive phrase. They also state they gained 311% in two weeks, which is an extremely high growth rate. This could be seen as a sign of confidence or good news for the company.

Second tweet about the penny stock uses the word ""gaining value,"" suggesting that the investment isn't performing well and investors are looking to buy back shares or increase their portfolio. That might indicate cautious sentiment rather than excitement, but it's not entirely negative either because there could be underlying reasons.

Step 3: Overall Sentiment Summary. The first tweet is definitely positive regarding Encog PLC and Alibaba's performance. However, the second tweet about the penny stock seems a bit uncertain, with some cautiously viewed behavior which might not be as strong of a push for the stock price. Combining these factors, it's probably a mix of positive and cautious signals.

But looking back at the output requirement, I need to choose one tag: [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. The first tweet is positive in its outlook, but the second might not be as significant. Considering that the penny stock mentioned isn't clearly linked to any specific event for Encog except through ""gaining value,"" which could imply investors are taking steps they didn't expect (like selling), it's possible that the overall sentiment is a mix.

However, since one tweet has a clear and strong positive outlook, maybe that dominates the analysis. But I'm not entirely sure if ""penny stock"" should count as a factor for Encog PLC specifically. Maybe both are part of the broader market, so their combined impact might be considered neutral or slightly negative because of the uncertainty around the penny stock.

Wait, in the first tweet, ""gaining 311% in two weeks"" is a clear positive sign pointing towards Encog PLC's future performance. The second tweet could mean that some investors are selling their penny investments or expecting to buy back shares, but not sure if that significantly affects Encog's stock price.

Alternatively, maybe the second tweet doesn't directly relate to Encog at all, so it might be misread as part of a broader context where other stocks like Alibaba are performing well. But without knowing more about ""penny,"" it's hard to say for sure.

I think the positive impact from the first tweet is enough to lean towards [Positive], but the second tweet adds some uncertainty which could be considered neutral. Maybe overall, the sentiment leans towards slightly positive because Encog PLC has a strong outlook, even if others are uncertain."
2015-04-17,Neutral,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the given company. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking through each tweet, I see mentions like ""baba"" and ""gm,"" so it's likely referring to GM. That makes sense because both ""baba"" and ""gm"" are names associated with GM.

Next, I'll analyze each tweet individually. 

1. The first tweet says that AT_USER (which I assume is a user account) strikes a car sales deal with GM's Chinese unit via URL. This seems positive because it indicates a specific type of collaboration or agreement, which could be beneficial for the company. It also mentions ""car sales,"" which might boost demand and earnings.

2. The second tweet mentions that $ baba has a bear flag breakout but doesn't reference any relevant tweets from the buy list. A bear flag is a technical indicator in stocks, often used by traders to gauge support or resistance. If it's breaking out, it could mean the stock may start going up. However, since I don't have context on this tweet for the company, it's hard to say if it directly affects GM.

3. The third tweet updates the IBM percentage change and references GM ($ lo $ nem). It says $ baba $ mmm $ lo $ nem, which seems like a call for action or stock performance, possibly GM. Updating percentages can give investor confidence in the stock's direction.

4. The fourth tweet mentions that China's tech giants are competing with maps to tell if something is safe to breathe. This sounds like it could be about safety features or regulations in the company's products. Safety issues might affect a company's reputation and possibly their sales, but I'm not sure how this directly impacts GM.

5. The fifth tweet says the user built seasons 1 and 2 of AT_USER's content and then mentions $ baba. This could be another positive action from the user related to the stock. It seems like they're expanding their product or service that benefits GM.

Putting it all together, I have multiple tweets indicating different things about the company. The car sales deal is definitely positive, the update of IBM percentages might mean more confidence in GM's performance, and the product expansion could provide ongoing revenue streams. 

However, the second tweet doesn't seem directly related to GM, so its impact might be minimal or neutral compared to others. The other tweets are more actionable and can have a more significant effect on the stock price."
2015-04-18,Missing,File not found
2015-04-19,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided two tweets and wants me to analyze their impact on a stock's future price using just a positive, neutral, or negative conclusion. 

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""pmcb filings updated saturday , april 18 , 2015 10:10 : 42 pm $ acad $ baba $ aapl $ ce URL"". Hmm, it mentions ""pmcb"" and ""baba"", which are known ETFs (Positive) related to dividend-paying stocks. That's a strong positive point.

The second tweet is ""rt AT_USER my video URL stock market analysis 4/18 / 15 $ spy $ nflx $ aapl $ baba $ iwm $ smh $ amzn $ xlf $ tlt $ ibb"". This includes multiple stocks: spy, nflx, aapl, etc. These are all positive trading cards related to tech and large-cap companies. They're providing market analysis with hashtags that could be relevant.

So the target stock seems to be AT_USER since it's in the second tweet as one of the listed stocks. Now, I need to analyze each tweet's impact on this stock.

The first tweet is a news update about pmcb filings, which is positive for their ETFs. This might mean more dividends or better financials, potentially increasing demand and earnings, so that could be a positive factor.

The second tweet is a market analysis thread, providing several tech stocks and their prices. This type of post can influence investor sentiment if it's trending towards certain stocks, which might affect the overall stock price.

Putting both tweets together, they're providing info about multiple ETFs related to technology and large-cap companies. Each tweet offers different perspectives on the tech sector, which is generally a growth-oriented field with strong earnings potentials. This could indicate confidence in upcoming trends, but it's also possible that investors might be cautious if there are risks associated with certain stocks.

However, given that these tweets are structured in a way to provide analysis without specific market moves, they're more about the current state of tech-related ETFs rather than immediate price movements. So, while they can influence investor sentiment, the overall impact on the stock's future price might be neutral because it doesn't directly suggest an increase or decrease but instead offers information that could be interpreted positively.

I should consider that these tweets are part of a broader context where investors might be more focused on trends rather than specific company news. Therefore, while they provide valuable information, they don't indicate a clear upward or downward trend for the stock in question."
2015-04-20,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of BABA. Let me take each tweet one by one.

First, the tweet says $ baba is still interesting here. Option buyers are stepping in and buying this thing. It mentions no trade atm right now but points towards potential growth. The word ""option buyers"" might indicate that people are increasing their investments, which could be positive for stock prices because more people are looking into options.

Second, the tweet from alibaba is expanding, even though it's unclear what the impact will be for investors down the line. I know alibaba is a big company in China's tech sector. If they're expanding, that might boost their revenue and market share. But the uncertainty about investors' reactions could mean there's still room for improvement or that some concerns are present.

Third, the user mentions AT_USER at $ baba with a solid entry point. That sounds like a good sign because a strong price movement can signal good buying momentum. The mention of waiting out the market suggests that it might be seen as cautious, but if they're on the right side, it could still support the stock.

Putting this together, each tweet seems positive. More buying, expansion, and solid entry points all contribute to a favorable outlook. I don't see any negative information here, so the sentiment is leaning towards positive."
2015-04-21,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol in the first tweet: $baba. Wait, that's not right. ""$baba"" doesn't make sense as a stock symbol because stock symbols usually start with letters or numbers and end with two letters or digits. Maybe it was a typo and should be something like ""BABA""? I'll assume that for now.

Next, the user mentions focusing on $fxi stocks to find ideas. That's talking about financial ideas or perhaps a new project in investment. I'm not sure how this relates to stock prices directly unless BABA is related to fxi somehow. Maybe it's just advice without any real data impact.

The second tweet talks about ""rt AT_USER could amazon do to groceries what it did to books ?"" It seems like the user is asking if there was a relationship between Amazon (AMAZON) and books, perhaps in the context of groceries. This is more speculative and not directly related to stock performance.

In the third tweet, the user talks about an interesting play in a sportswear company involving private investment. Sports companies can fluctuate in value depending on market trends and consumer behavior. If this investment is positive, it might boost BABA's price. However, without specific numbers or context from other sources, I can't be certain.

Putting all this together, the tweets seem to focus more on ideas rather than providing information that would affect stock prices. The user is advising about potential areas of interest but not making concrete statements that could influence a company's stock performance."
2015-04-22,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of BABA. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock from all the tweets. It seems like BABA is mentioned in several tweets: ""build got quite a makeover between seasons 1 and 2 of BABA :)"" which probably refers to BABA's performance during that time period. Other mentions include ""other stocks to watch"", which doesn't specify the company, so I might infer it's related to stock news.

Next, for each tweet, I'll separate them into Positive and Negative factors. But looking at these tweets, some are setups or informational without clear sentiment towards BABA. For example, tweets 3 and 4 don't directly mention BABA, so maybe those are less relevant. Tweets 1 and 2 are about other stocks and market news but don't specify if they're positive or negative for BABA.

Now, assessing the sentiment of these relevant tweets. Tweets 5 mentions that Alibaba group holds Ltd establishes a collaborative relationship with Alphabeta, which is a business move. This might indicate a positive outlook on the company's future, suggesting potential gains. Similarly, tweet 6 talks about Google, PCLN, TwTR, FB, etc., but nothing directly related to BABA. So these are probably not affecting BABA.

Since only tweets 1 and 2 mention other stocks or broader market news, they don't provide direct information on BABA's performance. Tweets 3 and 4 focus on other companies, which again don't impact BABA.

Considering the positive tweet about Alibaba moving forward with Alphabeta, it suggests potential growth in areas related to BABA, so there might be some optimism. However, without specific info on earnings or future prospects of BABA itself, it's hard to say definitively whether this is positive, negative, or neutral towards the stock.

Putting it all together, the information provided isn't sufficient to make a clear determination because not enough tweets are directly about BABA. Therefore, I'll classify it as Neutral."
2015-04-23,Neutral,"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I have three tweets, and each seems to contain different topics related to stock prices for a company. My goal is to determine whether these tweets are likely to impact the future stock price of that company and assign one of the categories: [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative].

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. But looking at all three tweets provided, I don't see any mention of a specific stock symbol. For example, the first tweet mentions ""hpq,"" which isn't clear if it's an index like the S&P 500 or a specific company. Similarly, other tweets have words like ""qqq,"" ""twtr,"" and others that aren't familiar to me as stock symbols.

Hmm, this is a problem because without knowing which stock these tweets are referring to, I can't accurately assess their impact on its price. If I don't know the stock symbol, it's impossible to compare current prices with historical data or gauge sentiment about it. So, perhaps the user intended for each tweet to refer to a specific company, but they didn't provide that information.

Given that, maybe there's an assumption here. Perhaps all three tweets are referring to the same stock? Let me check again. The first tweet says ""hpq,"" which I don't recognize. The second mentions ""twtr,"" which is an exchange-traded fund (ETF). That might be a different company. The third one talks about a partnership with a US company, specifically shanghai general motors.

This mix of symbols and names suggests that the target stock isn't clearly identified in each tweet. Without knowing which stock it refers to, I can't evaluate its impact on the stock price. It's possible that some tweets are unrelated or perhaps referring to a different stock entirely, making an accurate assessment challenging.

Since I don't have enough information about the specific stocks mentioned, I might consider that none of these tweets provide useful data for assessing the stock's performance. In such cases, without any relevant data points, it's impossible to determine whether the stock is going up, staying the same, or down. Therefore, perhaps the correct response is to indicate [Neutral], assuming no information is available.

Alternatively, if all three tweets are referring to a single stock but with unclear identifiers, I might infer that they don't provide direct data about its performance. But without concrete evidence of a positive or negative trend in any tweet, it's safer to lean towards [Neutral].

I should also consider the possibility that some tweets may inadvertently mention a company by name (like ""twtr"" being an ETF for China) and others like ""baba,"" which could refer to various entities—some known companies, others less so. This variability complicates any assessment.

In conclusion, without knowing which stock these tweets are referring to or having specific data on how each tweet affects the stock price, it's challenging to assign a sentiment label. Therefore, I'll conclude with [Neutral] as there's insufficient information provided."
2015-04-24,Positive,"Alright, so I have to figure out how to analyze these tweets regarding their impact on the stock price of $BABA. Let me start by going through each tweet one by one.

First tweet: ""our penny stock picks gained 1472 % in 2 months ! get access to our new pick : URL $ segi $ baba $ swet"". Hmm, okay, it looks like they're promoting a stock named segi or maybe something similar? It mentions that their stock gains 1472% over two months. That's a significant increase. So, the tweet is encouraging purchasing this penny stock, which usually means positive sentiment because investors are excited about potential growth.

Second tweet: ""$ baba nice day 👌 URL"". This seems like a friendly greeting, maybe just to keep engagement high. It doesn't seem negative or positive; it's more of an action by the company, perhaps trying to increase their following.

Third tweet: ""$ baba $ 85 break coming ..."". Again, a casual message with some numbers and an exclamation mark. It sounds like they're commenting on the stock price being at $85 and planning something ""break coming,"" which might mean selling or increasing its value? Not sure about the intent here.

Fourth tweet: ""$ baba gains alerted this @ 82 join our private group chat today ! there is a one time fee of 199.99 . … URL"". This seems to be a call to action, encouraging investors to join their private group chat. It mentions joining and has a clear instruction about the fee. The mention of ""gains alerted"" might imply they're making investors aware or informed about something important.

Putting it all together: The first tweet is clearly promoting the stock with high expected growth. The second is casual. The third seems more speculative, but the fourth is an action call to act quickly. Given that some are positive and others are more informational, I think overall sentiment leans towards positive because of the high-growth promotion and the clear action in the fourth tweet.

I should make sure each tweet's factors are considered: Positive tweets are good for stock price because they show potential gains or upgrades. Negative would be if they mention losses or negative news. Here, even though some tweets are more casual or speculative, the main positive is from the first and fourth tweets, which are promoting or encouraging actions.

So, combining all these, I think it's a mixed but leaning towards positive overall sentiment because of the significant gain in the first tweet."
2015-04-25,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out how these tweets are likely going to affect the stock price of the company. Let's take each tweet one by one.

First tweet: ""AT_USER since your tweet was sent $ baba has risen 3.157 % . see your featured tweet on market parse URL"" – Okay, that's just a greeting or a note from AT_USER. It doesn't mention anything about the stock price or any positive or negative factors related to BABA. So probably not affecting much here.

Second tweet: ""most popular marketplaces to buy stuff online . $ baba , $ amzn , $ ebay , $ grpn URL URL"" – This seems like a call to action. It's suggesting that users are looking at various stock prices on these platforms. Maybe it's just encouraging others to check out the stocks? I'm not sure if this has any positive or negative impact, but maybe it's trying to build some buzz without specific information about the company.

Putting them together, both tweets don't mention anything related to BABA's performance or any specific market trends that would influence the stock price. So overall, neither tweet seems to have a significant effect on the stock."
2015-04-26,Missing,File not found
2015-04-27,Positive,"Okay, I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company called BABA (formerly known as Alibaba Group). Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at each tweet one by one. The target stock symbol is BABA, so that's our focus. 

1. ""how to buy alibaba at 10x earnings URL $ sftby , $ baba intressant ?"" This tweet seems like a question about buying Alibaba at a certain price point. It mentions something about 10x earnings and the stock symbol SFTBY, which I don't recognize. Maybe it's asking if BABA is interesting or relevant? It could be neutral since it's more of an informational tweet rather than a positive or negative statement.

2. ""china telecom helps fortify alibaba's $ 590 million bet on smartphone vendor meizu $ baba URL"" This one mentions China Telecom and their role in fortifying Alibaba's bet on Meizu, which is a Chinese phone company. Fortifying a bet usually means increasing confidence or backing, which can be seen as positive because it enhances their position. So this tweet adds to the sentiment.

3. ""$ baba back to the shake and bake action if we go below 85.20"" This seems like an intraday warning from BABA. If they drop below a certain level, maybe they're signaling that they're about to reverse or stabilize their actions, which could be negative because it indicates a bearish outlook.

4. ""$ baba closed @ 84.54 watch it carefully URL"" Similar to tweet 3, this is an intraday update indicating the stock price and urging careful monitoring. It's an action taken by BABA, so it adds to the overall positive sentiment as they're taking steps forward.

5. ""AT_USER since your tweet was sent $ baba has risen 1.754 % . see your featured tweet on market parse URL"" This is a follow-up after tweet 4. It's acknowledging their tweet and providing context about BABA's price movement. Positive because it confirms the action they've taken, reinforcing the positive outlook.

6. ""rt AT_USER friday orb trades - $ iwm $ spy $ qqq $ twtr $ baba $ aapl $ fb $ pcln $ bidu $ nflx $ tsla $ amzn $ googl $ yhoo $ lnkd URL"" This is a reaction to their tweet on Friday morning. It's a follow-up from BABA, so it adds context about the market movements and likely sentiment towards the stock.

7. ""alibaba group holding starting to show strength URL $ baba"" This tweet states that Alibaba is showing strength in terms of its holding. This is an important piece of information because it directly affects BABA's position. It's positive because it shows confidence among investors, which can boost their price.

Now, combining all these tweets: Each one either informs about the stock or reacts to previous statements. They all point towards BABA doing well, so overall sentiment should be positive."
2015-04-28,Negative,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let's go through each tweet step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. It seems like the focus is on ""baba"" because it appears multiple times in some of the tweets. So, I'll assume the stock symbol is BABA.

Next, for each tweet, I should separate into positive and negative factors. But looking at these tweets, they don't all have explicit positive or negative language. Many are more about updates from other users or upcoming events. For example, ""rt AT_USER $ baba is another great one to strangle , will go up 10 bucks either way within the next 2 months..."" seems like a strategic suggestion, maybe by AT_USER.

Then, I need to assess sentiment based on these tweets. Some tweets seem positive about BABA's potential performance, others are more about upcoming events or suggestions. For example, ""thank god i sold my $ baba put lol . it's running now"" is a negative note after selling a put option, which can indicate fear and nervousness.

However, without explicit positive or negative words, it's hard to parse each tweet fully. Some tweets have numbers in quotes, like ""$ 10 bucks either way"", which suggests potential gains but not necessarily positive information about the stock itself.

Putting this together, there are a mix of positive comments about BABA (like suggestions for price movements) and negative comments after selling options or updates from other users. There's no clear indication of strong positive news about the company.

Given that sentiment is both varied and sometimes conflicting, I can't assign a single overall sentiment. It seems like some tweets are favorable but others carry uncertainty or fear."
2015-04-29,Missing,File not found
2015-04-30,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on stock price for $baba. First, let me identify the target stock symbol from each tweet.

The first tweet says ""when will you disclose your stake in $ baba ?"". That seems out of context because it doesn't provide a specific stock name. Maybe that's a placeholder or an error, so I can't extract a stock symbol here. I'll skip this one since I don't have the necessary information.

The second tweet is ""AT_USER when will you disclose your stake in $ baba ? inquiring minds would like to know ..."". Again, it doesn't provide a stock name and feels out of place. So, no target stock identified from these tweets either. They're all in an inconsistent format without context that points towards a specific company.

Without any relevant tweet data, I can't analyze the sentiment or impact on the stock price for $baba. The user must have provided more context or specific stock information elsewhere to get accurate analysis."
2015-05-01,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of BABA. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

The first tweet says: ""i like seeing the $ 80 mark get defended for $ baba again . the harder they try to hold it , the harder it will fall when it breaks."" It seems positive because it expresses hope that the stock won't take a hit. The second tweet is about a penny stock, which tends to be volatile but might see gains or losses depending on the market. It mentions gains of 44% over two days, but it's not clear if this is due to good news or just luck.

Combined, both tweets are generally positive. The first one suggests that even when holding the stock for longer periods, it will eventually fall, which is a cautious outlook. The second tweet might indicate some positive events, though without more context, it's hard to tell if it's expected performance or an anomaly. However, given that BABA is a small-cap stock and often has less volatility, these tweets could be seen as positive signals about the company's potential.

So, overall, both tweets are supportive of BABA, suggesting they may contribute positively to the stock price."
2015-05-02,Neutral,"Okay, I'm going to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of the given company. The task is to figure out if each tweet is positive, neutral, or negative and then decide the overall effect.

First, let's look at the target stock symbol. The first tweet says: ""baidu : rain rain go away URL $ baba $ goog $ qihu $ sohu $.""

Hmm, I notice that the symbol starts with ""baidu"" followed by some text about rain, which could be a typo or just irrelevant info. Then there are URLs for BABA, GOOG, QIU, and SOHU. These might not directly relate to the stock of Baidu.

I don't have any other information provided, so I can't extract much more from these tweets. They seem out of context compared to the target stock.

Since there's no relevant information about the stock or its performance, it's impossible to assess the impact on the stock price. Without knowing what each tweet signifies for Baidu, I can't determine if they're positive, negative, or neutral towards the company.

Therefore, without sufficient context, the tweets cannot provide any insight into how they will affect the stock price of Baidu."
2015-05-03,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of APEX Corporation. Hmm, the user provided two tweets and specified I need to determine if each is positive, neutral, or negative towards APEX.

First, I'll look at tweet 1: ""catch a winner in live chat $ goog $ pcln $ twtr $ fb $ aapl $ ebay $ gm $ dust $ baba URL URL"". This seems like an announcement about something significant related to their stock. The mention of GOOG and TWTR makes me think it's about the Google search results or maybe an earnings call or a new product launch. All these words suggest a positive outcome, so I'll categorize this as Positive.

Now, tweet 2: ""edr.to endeavour silver corp . 52wk high click here -> URL trending $ edr.to $ intq . l $ fxa $ baba edr.to stocks …"". This one mentions Silver Corp and talks about it being a 52-week high. Silver is known for its volatility, especially in the energy sector, which can cause stock price swings. The mention of intq and BABA might indicate a potential event or another company related to silver. Since Silver is generally a volatile stock and can fluctuate widely, I'm not sure about the overall sentiment here. It's more speculative, so maybe Neutral because it doesn't provide a clear direction but could be seen as uncertain.

So, putting it together: The first tweet is positive, the second is neutral."
2015-05-04,Neutral,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided eight tweets related to stock prices for BABA (Baba Inc.) and wants me to determine their impact on the future stock price using a scoring system: Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. It seems like the relevant stock is ""baba"" since it's mentioned multiple times in the tweets. So, the target is BABA (BABA).

Next, for each tweet, I'll separate them into positive and negative factors. Let me go through each one:

1. The first tweet mentions straddles or strangles with a 15-20% move likely, advising to hedge.
   - Positive: Strategy suggestion about volatility trade
   - Negative: No explicit bad advice

2. Second tweet has links and a trending summary with multiple stock names including baba. It suggests looking at other stocks but doesn't mention anything negative or positive for BABA.

3. Third tweet talks about short sales updating, ending at 8pm on Sunday. Doesn't seem relevant to BABA's price movement.

4. Fourth tweet mentions BABA to report robust QFourth Quarter results despite monetization issues.
   - Positive: Expected performance improvement
   - Negative: Not negative since it's positive

5. Fifth tweet reviews an airline, no mention of stock prices or BABA.

6. Sixth tweet also about a stock message board update; no relevant info for BABA.

7. Seventh tweet discusses percentage changes and mentions other stocks but not related to BABA.

8. Eighth tweet is a disclaimer, mentioning TV shows without any financial context.

After analyzing each tweet, it seems all the relevant information ( tweets 1-8) don't provide direct or significant updates on BABA's stock price movement. Most focus on strategies, market trends, and unrelated topics. Therefore, there's no clear positive or negative impact."
2015-05-05,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the overall sentiment of these tweets about BABA stock. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

Starting with tweet 1: It mentions various stocks but doesn't provide a specific company name, just ""@ cboe"" which is the CBOE index. Hmm, that's not helpful for identifying the target stock. So maybe I can skip this one because it's too vague.

Next, tweet 2 talks about BABA (baba) and uses ""url analyze,"" but again, it's unclear if it refers to a specific stock. It seems incomplete or just an example without context.

Tweet 3 is interesting—it mentions BABA and YUUMATIS (bidu). Without knowing the company code or name of the tweet, I can't identify the exact stock. So maybe this tweet isn't relevant enough for my analysis since it's too vague.

Tweets 4 and 5 don't mention a specific stock but talk about other entities like XLB materials or financials. They also reference tutorials on platforms like TUTTER and maybes, which might imply general sentiment rather than company-specific info. Not sure about this one yet.

Tweet 6 focuses on BABA (baba) with some news related to earnings. It's possible that the sentiment is positive because they're monitoring the stock, but without more context, it's hard to gauge just how strong their performance might be.

Tweets 7 and 8 are about JPMorgan (jpmorgan) downgrade Baidu (bidu). This could indicate a negative impact on BABA since JPMorgan downgrades Baidu. But I don't know if that directly affects BABA's stock price or just Baidu's.

Tweet 9 mentions XLB, which is a ETF tracking the S&P 500, and talks about dividend policies for SPDRs (spdr) like SPY (sh), TSH (sh), SDRL (baba). This seems to be more about the broader market performance related to BABA. So this could affect investor sentiment positively as the market might react to BABA's performance.

Finally, tweet 10 is also about BABA and mentions financials with a stock market trend tag. It doesn't specify a company or context much beyond discussing earnings.

Putting it all together, most tweets are either incomplete, too vague, or discuss broader market trends. Tweets 3 and 6 give some context but without specific stock info. Tweet 9 is the only one that directly refers to BABA, which could influence sentiment positively, especially if there's a positive dividend announcement."
2015-05-06,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let's start by looking at each tweet and breaking them down step by step.

First, I need to extract the target stock from the tweets. Scanning through each one:

1. ""rt AT_USER alibaba : low expectations = upside surprise URL $ baba"" – This mentions BABA (Balanced Investee), so the target is BABA.
2. ""rt AT_USER $ baba & $ yhoo strong ( $ baba earnings tomorrow premkt )"" – BABA and YHOO are mentioned, but I'm not sure which one the tweet is targeting. It seems like it's about BABA's earnings.
3. ""privatetrader wednesday's prospects $ bkln $ cbg $ wec $ tsla $ wfm $ gmcr $ baba URL"" – This includes several stocks: LKNA, CBG, WEC, TSLA, WFM, GMCR, BABA. So, multiple stocks are mentioned.
4. ""ibb biotech ishares open click here -> URL trending $ ibb $ wfc $ baba $ t ibb pennystocks finance"" – This seems to be about BIIB (BIP), BIOT, ISHARES, and others. Not sure about the target stock here.

Now, I'll analyze each tweet one by one for positive or negative factors and sentiment.

1. ""rt AT_USER alibaba : low expectations = upside surprise URL $ baba"" – This seems to indicate that BABA is expected to perform well in the future, which suggests a positive outlook.
2. ""rt AT_USER $ baba & $ yhoo strong ( $ baba earnings tomorrow premkt )"" – The mention of earnings and a strong outlook for BABA could imply a potential increase in stock price, supporting the positive sentiment.
3. ""privatetrader wednesday's prospects $ bkln $ cbg $ wec $ tsla $ wfm $ gmcr $ baba URL"" – This tweet is about multiple stocks. It mentions earnings for TSLA and others like SEMI (SECG), LKNA, CBG, WEC, etc. If BABA is among these, a strong performance could be positive.
4. ""ibb biotech ishares open click here -> URL trending $ ibb $ wfc $ baba $ t ibb pennystocks finance"" – This mentions BIIB (BIP), which I don't recognize, and others like WFC (Wells Fargo & Co) and BABA. The mention of a trending stock could imply some support, but without specific info on its performance.

Next, I'll assess the sentiment for each tweet:

1. ""rt AT_USER alibaba : low expectations = upside surprise URL $ baba"" – This has ""low expectations,"" which is a negative phrase, suggesting that people think BABA might underperform.
2. ""rt AT_USER $ baba & $ yhoo strong ( $ baba earnings tomorrow premkt )"" – The phrase ""strong ( $ baba earnings)"" indicates optimistic about earnings, so positive sentiment.
3. ""privatetrader wednesday's prospects $ bkln $ cbg $ wec $ tsla $ wfm $ gmcr $ baba URL"" – Since it includes TSLA with a mention of earnings, the strong earnings could boost the stock price positively.
4. ""ibb biotech ishares open click here -> URL trending $ ibb $ wfc $ baba $ t ibb pennystocks finance"" – The mention of BABA suggests potential support, but without specific details on its performance, it's a bit uncertain.

Now, combining the sentiments: All tweets are either positive or neutral. Each positive tweet leans towards a potential upside, while others have some uncertainty about TSLA's earnings. Since multiple positive factors and a possible strong performance in TSLA suggest an overall positive impact on BABA."
2015-05-07,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how the given tweets impact the stock price of BABA. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet mentions Alibaba reaching a record $1 trillion gmv up from 2015. This sounds positive because it's an expected growth and sets a benchmark, which usually boosts investor confidence.
   
2. The second tweet talks about earnings reports but doesn't provide specific details. I can only assume that if the company is growing, this might contribute to a positive sentiment.

3. The third tweet mentions high-octane calls with over 19,000 Oct 90s calls in March. More octo traffic often indicates investor interest and could suggest a positive trend.

4. Statements like ""baba shares extend gains"" directly indicate that the stock is moving higher, which is a classic positive sign.

5. The fifth tweet states a 10% increase in market cap due to Alibaba's earnings, suggesting growth and thus a positive outlook.

6. Similar to the previous one, a 10% increase in gmv without specific details might support a positive trend.

7. The tweet mentions that technical analysis is flawed or uncertain, which could be a red flag but also might show some concern as it highlights uncertainty about future performance.

8. This tweet advises against buying BABA and suggests avoiding YHOO instead. It's more about user advice rather than stock price impact.

9. A 9.8% premarket gain shows strong growth, indicating investor confidence in the stock.

10. The tweet mentions significant mobile usage contributing to gmv growth, which is positive for the company.

11. A 10% increase in earnings with a Q4 eps beat suggests improved financial performance, reinforcing a positive sentiment.

12. The tweet predicts a 15-20% move due to pressure from the IPO, indicating potential for a rebound after past losses.

13. The stock price held at $85 but is rising further, which adds to the trend and supports positive outlook.

14. Similar to point 9, a modest increase in gmv with mobile usage suggests growth.

15. Focus on earnings of Priceline, CBS, and Alibaba, which are different companies but all earning for positive stock movement.

16. After a bullish day, people start expecting more gains, which can lead to selling pressure.

17. A click through to a webpage related to stock info suggests the company is being actively tracked by investors or analysts, which could indicate growth concerns.

18. The tweet mentions past trading activity with other companies, but no specific impact on BABA.

19. The initial announcement of earnings leading to a rating might suggest that the market has an expectation of positive performance.

20. A 9EMA (9-day moving average) showing strong momentum could indicate ongoing gains and thus positive sentiment.

21. An upcoming stake acquisition suggests future growth potential, which is a sign of confidence.

22. High calls for weekly earnings could lead to increased buying, supporting the stock price.

23. The tweet highlights strong premarket gains, which is another sign of rising investor interest.

24. BABA being ""boom"" directly indicates significant upward movement.

25. Mentioning a cave in a story about treasure suggests positive outlook and potential for growth.

Putting it all together, each tweet either supports the idea that BABA will grow or mentions concerns about uncertainty but overall leans towards positive outcomes. The main points include increased gmv, mobile usage, positive ratings from different companies, and strong premarket gains. These indicators collectively suggest a good chance of positive stock performance."
2015-05-08,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of BABA. 

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the first few tweets, all of them mention ""baba"" as the stock symbol or mentions other related terms like spy, aapl, etc. So, BABA seems to be the focus here.

Now, for each tweet, I have to separate positive and negative factors. Then assess the sentiment towards investor confidence. Let's go through each one by one.

1. "" $ baba upgraded to buy pt 98 $ from neutral at goldman full story URL $ spy $ aapl $ googl $ yhoo $ qqq"" – This seems like a positive statement about BABA's position with major players, indicating investor confidence. High stock price probably means they see it favorably.

2. "" toptickertweets $ spy $ oil $ spx $ ko $ aapl $ gevo $ pep $ mnkd $ baba $ dps sentiquant 2015050 8 10:00 : 05:085"" – This is more about sentiment rather than specific factors, but mentions SPX and other sectors. It's unclear if it's positive or negative.

3. "" rt AT_USER alibaba has ' its mojo back . ' URL $ baba URL"" – The mention of ""mojo back"" suggests confidence in BABA's success, which is positive.

4. "" added $ baba"" – Simple addition without any factors mentioned, so it's probably neutral or a minor update.

5. "" goldman upgrades $ baba to buy . ' remains a direct exposure to spending moving online , particularly mobile . ' ( h / t AT_USER "" Marissa Mayer $ yhoo"" "" I was about to break all technical levels lower "" marissa mayer yhoo"" "" baba alibaba group holding ltd . fu URL) – This is an upgrade from a previous rating, which generally shows investor confidence. The mention of mobile spending exposure also adds positive sentiment.

6. "" goldman upgrades $ baba to buy . ' remains a direct exposure to spending moving online , particularly mobile . ' ( h / t AT_USER )"" – Similar to tweet 5, another upgrade statement with positive factors mentioned.

7. "" rt AT_USER thanks for reporting $ baba as i was about to break all technical levels lower "" marissa mayer $ yhoo"" "" I was about to break all technical levels lower is not true. Wait no, it says, I was about to break all technical levels lower and now says it's not true. So the author realizes that they were incorrect. This indicates a correction in their opinion, which can be seen as slightly negative because the reader had a different expectation and now sees it improved. But overall sentiment is still positive, just with some nuance.

8. "" jumei : visiting the beauty queen URL $ baba $ jmei"" – This seems like an unrelated tweet about a personal matter involving BABA.

9. "" rt AT_USER $ yhoo $ baba $ wfm $ nus $ csod $ ann fib charts URL"" – No specific factors mentioned, so it's neutral.

10. "" rt AT_USER $ baba back to ' buy ' at goldman , reversing a 6 - month old rating change , says underperformance vs peers ( esp tencent $ 0700 …"" – The stock price reversal from a previous downgrade suggests investor confidence. Positive sentiment.

11. "" rt AT_USER post-earnings plays : $ baba , $ tsla , $ mcd . $ amzn . earnings next week : $ csco , $ gddy AT_USER w / AT_USER $ z & $ yelp URL"" – This is about future earnings expectations, which can indicate confidence in BABA's future performance. Positive.

12. "" AT_USER since your tweet was sent $ baba has risen 7.872 % . see your featured tweet on market parse URL"" – The positive news about the stock price increase directly supports BABA's valuation and indicates investor sentiment.

Now, compiling these thoughts: There are a mix of upgrades, corrections (some slight), and mentions of increased stock value. However, all points lean towards positive sentiment indicating investor confidence."
2015-05-09,Negative,"Alright, I need to determine the likely impact of these tweets on the stock price of BABA. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet says $baba is a buy from Edie Leung of FAIRMAPLyr. This suggests a positive outlook, but it's vague and not enough to assess overall sentiment.

2. The second tweet mentions trends in dnax, dna brands inc., dis, slv, dnax finance, etc., all related to BABA. While this could indicate some interest or stock activity, it doesn't provide clear data points for the stock price.

3. The third tweet talks about Alibaba's earnings report and mentions a rally at 8.8% plus other factors like a 16.2% decline since their IPO and -7.3%. This is confusing because the numbers seem out of context or perhaps from another company, not BABA. I'm not sure if this is related to BABA's stock.

4. The fourth tweet discusses the CEO of AlphaPage and mentions ABLN as a company. Again, this seems unrelated unless it's about their own stock performance, which isn't indicated here.

5. The fifth tweet states that Alibaba is announcing its Q2 2015 results officially. This directly mentions BABA (BABA) with a press release date of March. It's positive because it's showing confidence in the company's future and likely good news for investors.

6. The sixth tweet mentions a buy rating from Evercore ISI targeting $105, which could be a signal of optimism about BABA but not specific to its stock performance.

7. The seventh tweet by General Dynamics relates to their stock with similar wording about rising prices. This could indicate that the company is doing well and might benefit from BABA's price movement, but it's speculative without direct mention.

8. The eighth and ninth tweets both state that $baba has risen 8.063% since the tweet was sent, suggesting a current positive trend in their stock price as of now. But this could be misleading if other factors are at play or if the user hasn't been actively following BABA for some time.

Considering all these points, the main positive information comes from the fifth and eighth tweets, but they're somewhat vague. The mention of an earnings report by Alibaba aligns with a positive outlook. However, I don't have enough concrete data to make a strong judgment on the overall impact on BABA's stock price."
2015-05-10,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually.

The first tweet is ""rt AT_USER $ baba : axiom securities analysts give alibaba group holding a $ 110.00 ... : URL"". It looks like the user is mentioning that their tweet has been held by some analyst at Axiom Security, and they've given it a value of around $110. I don't see any positive or negative indicators here; it's more about information sharing rather than sentiment.

The second tweet is ""AT_USER $ baba alibaba takes 9.3 % stake in zulily URL"". This seems to be a news release where ABB is expanding into the e-commerce space by acquiring Zulu. That sounds like a positive sign for the company, indicating growth and expansion. So this tweet is likely to boost the stock.

The third tweet says, ""AT_USER since your tweet was sent $ baba has risen 8.109 % . see your featured tweet on market parse URL"". This one is more of an update or notification from ABB about a rise in their price. It's clearly showing that the stock is up by around 8%, which is positive for investors.

Looking at the fourth tweet, ""usg united states oil fund , lp news click here -> URL trending $ usg $ wfm $ esl.to $ baba usg trade ideas investing"". This seems to be about a financial product from USG, which could affect stock prices based on its performance. It doesn't provide direct information about the target company, so it's probably less relevant.

Now, combining these thoughts: The second tweet is about a positive acquisition, the third tweet confirms an increase in price, and there's another tweet mentioning a financial product that could impact USG. All of these are signals of growth, expansion, or potential earnings, which should be positive for the stock."
2015-05-11,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact on the stock price for [BABA] based on these tweets. Let me take it step by step.

First, looking at each tweet individually and see what they're saying about BABA. 

The first tweet mentions a PT group being cut by Mkm Partners to $115.00, but I'm not sure if that's positive or negative for BABA. It says ""buy rating"" which is interesting because that could mean buying the stock, so maybe it's positive.

Next, the tweet about $BABA may $89 calls seems like a price action update. Calls can influence prices sometimes, depending on market conditions, but I don't have enough context here.

Then there's a mention of BABA buying a stake in U.S. E-commerce site Zulily. That sounds like a positive sign because buying more shares usually increases investor interest and can boost stock value.

In the fourth tweet, it mentions buyout by NBL. If a company is bought out, that might indicate acquisition activity which could be good for BABA's valuation, but I'm not sure about the sentiment yet.

The fifth tweet talks about micron technology ticks up in finance and investing. That could mean strong news related to the stock, possibly good or neutral depending on specifics.

The sixth tweet mentions ZNA making weekly calls with pre-earnings straddles against GSC and BABA. This might be a micro-term affecting investor sentiment but it's unclear how that translates to stock price changes.

Now, I need to assess each tweet for positive, negative, or neutral factors. The overall trend seems to involve buying rates (positive), some calls about stock price movements, stake acquisition, potential buyout, and some financial news.

Considering these mixed signals—some positive, some speculative, it's hard to tell the overall impact. Maybe BABA is undervalued because of possible acquisitions or high valuations due to recent investments? But without more context on EBITDA or other fundamentals, I can't be certain.

So I think it's neutral because while there are some positive factors like stake acquisition and potential buyout, the speculative elements from calls and financial news could weigh it down. It might not consistently go up or down."
2015-05-12,Positive,"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a list of tweets related to the stock market and wants me to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. They've given specific instructions to extract the stock symbol from each tweet and then analyze each tweet for positive, negative factors, sentiment, and overall impact.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol. Looking through the tweets, it seems most are related to Alibaba (BABA) because several tweets mention $ baba, which is their ticker symbol. The others seem more about other companies or unrelated topics like Apple Pay or Apple Inc. So, the likely stock is BABA.

Next, for each tweet, I'll separate into positive and negative factors. Let me go through them one by one:

1. ""episode 4 with jeff smith : clip 4 ) URL on AT_USER $ yhoo and AT_USER $ baba stakes URL"" – This mentions stake buys but doesn't specify positive or negative.
2. ""forget next day delivery , alibaba rolls out three-hour delivery service for healthcare goods in china URL $ baba"" – Positive because it's a new initiative.
3. ""so after announcing plans to partner with $ baba on bringing apple pay to china , $ aapl is down 1 % . because this mkt makes sense . and bonds."" – Negative, as the stock drops.
4. ""$ baba : alibaba group holding limited ( nyse : baba ) grabbing remaining ... "" – Positive action by Alibaba.
5. ""$ baba sell this chinese junk boat ! alibaba's u . s . ipo got the company ordered out of taiwan URL"" – Negative, selling a bad product.
6. "" $ baba sell this chinese junk boat ! alibaba's u . s . ipo got the company ordered out of taiwan URL"" – Repeated negative sell statement.
7. ""AT_USER aol is a dying relic picked up on a scratch and dent sale . yahoo is primarily valued for its $ baba stake , hard to compare ."" – Negative, mentioning a bad asset.
8. ""$ baba URL"" – No info provided.
9. ""rt AT_USER $ aapl $ baba ( early a . m . news ) apple in talks with alibaba to launch apple pay in china URL"" – Positive, aligning with BABA's strategy.
10. ""$ babaURL"" – Just the stock name.
11. ""AT_USER $ baba alibaba : zulily stake highlights u . s . ambition ; ebay next ?"" – Positive about Alibaba's potential expansion.
12. ""rt AT_USER AT_USER watch the morning call express URL URL $ spx $ spy $ tlt $ aapl $ baba morningcall"" – Positive for the market.

Now, I'll assess sentiment for each tweet. For positive factors, we look at stock gains, mentions of successful partnerships, and alignment with tech trends. For negative factors, we consider declines in company performance or bad investments.

Looking through all tweets, most are either positive (like stake buys, new initiatives) or negative (declining stocks or selling bad items). The overall sentiment is a mix but leans towards positive because many tweets support BABA's strategy and partnerships with other tech companies. However, the market drop in tweet 3 and some selling statements hint at uncertainty, which could be seen as negative.

But considering most are supportive of Alibaba and their broader tech sector, it leans slightly positive despite some minor negatives. So, overall sentiment is leaning towards [Positive]."
2015-05-13,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out how these tweets are affecting the stock price of BABA. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol, which is BABA. From the tweets provided, I see mentions like ""baba"", ""mu"", and ""lnkd"". So that's BABA, MSFT, PFF, and LNKD. But since we're focusing on BABA, those other stocks might not be as relevant unless they influence the overall market.

The first tweet says, ""AT_USER since your tweet was sent $ baba has risen 7.802 % . see your featured tweet on market parse URL."" It's a positive statement about BABA rising by 7.8%, which suggests good news for investors. But I should check other tweets to see if there are any conflicting information.

The second tweet repeats the same sentiment, reinforcing that BABA is up. It's just reiterating the 7.8% increase.

Third tweet mentions cloud computing partnering with Alibaba in Dubai but doesn't specifically mention anything about BABA. It talks about stock prices and companies like MSFT,googl,AZD,AMZN. No direct info on BABA here, so maybe not affecting it much.

The fourth tweet is a retweet of the first one, just saying ""rt AT_USER ... alibaba announces partnership with disney."" Again, no mention of BABA or any specific stocks, so probably doesn't impact BABA's price.

Fifth tweet is another retweet about the same partnership announcement. No new info on BABA either.

Sixth tweet mentions $dis and $baba URL, which could mean that BABA stock has a specific URL being parsed, but without context, it's unclear how this affects anything.

Seventh tweet talks about Alipay having over 800 million users coming to Walmart. It doesn't mention BABA or any of the other stocks mentioned before. Maybe this is about the broader market effect on consumers, which could affect stock prices indirectly, but I'm not sure it's a direct factor for BABA.

Eighth tweet mentions that baba alibaba group holding ltd. has 52 weeks low activity, suggesting lower traffic or interest. Again, no mention of BABA itself. It might be about the overall market sentiment or other companies, but not directly impacting BABA unless there's a correlation.

So, putting it all together: The first two tweets are positive with a significant increase in BABA. The others either repeat this positive info or talk about unrelated topics. They don't provide conflicting information and aren't negative or neutral. There's no mention of any negative news, so the overall sentiment seems positive."
2015-05-14,Positive,"Alright, let's see. The user has given me several tweets about $ baba and wants me to determine their likely impact on the stock price using [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, I need to parse each tweet. I'll extract the stock symbol from each one. 

Looking at the first tweet: "" signaled twitter en $ baba - URL URL"". The URL doesn't seem relevant here, so maybe it's just a link and not part of the stock information.

Next tweet is also about $ baba but in another language: "" $ baba buying on dipbuybuybuy"". I see that this mentions a trading strategy with dipbuybuybuy. That sounds like a positive action because it's indicating interest or participation, which could drive price up.

Then there are two more tweets starting with AT_USER. Both mention that $ baba has risen 1.410 % and make predictions about the stock. Since both say the same thing, they reinforce each other positively. 

The next tweet is "" rt AT_USER deals of the day : $ baba announces strategic investment in yto express URL"". This explicitly says that $ baba is announcing a strategic investment, which is good news for investors because it's a major company action.

Another tweet just mentions $ baba without any positive action: ""$ baba $usage $hnr $ nflx $baba tradeideas stock"". It looks like it's listing various stock prices and trends but no specific indication of buying or selling. 

Following that, two more tweets about billionaires with a lot of money mentioned: "" stocks of the billionaires URL billgates warrenbuffett carlosslim ..."". This sounds speculative as it's related to a controversial topic, which might lead to uncertainty in stock price.

The last tweet is "" $ baba - alibaba group announces strategic investment in yto express URL"". Similar to tweet 5, this indicates an investment, which could be positive. 

Now, putting this together: tweets 2 and 6 mention trading strategies with other companies, which can indicate interest. The ones starting with AT_USER are very positive about $ baba's performance. Tweets 3,7,8,10 talk about strategic investments or listing various stocks, which are generally considered positive signals. 

However, some tweets like 4 and 12 don't provide specific action but just statements without details. Since there is a clear trend of positive mentions and mentions of strategic investments, it seems the overall sentiment is positive.

So, I'll conclude that the stock is likely to be [Positive]."
2015-05-15,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of BABA (Beta Technologies). Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet mentions a possible breakout in the $BABA chart and suggests waiting for higher volume. This could mean that there's some interest or momentum, which might be positive.
2. The second tweet talks about trending with various stock prices but focuses on hnsn, hansen medical inc., etc. It doesn't mention any specific movements or news related to BABA, so maybe it's neutral.
3. Another tweet by moe_the_gyp mentions eliminating a 10 million share for Dan Loeb and relates to Alibaba swapping brands. This could be negative if there are rumors about changes in company leadership.
4. The fourth tweet says $CNET didn't break the $2 mark, which might imply that their stock is undervalued. If it's undervalued, that's positive because investors would buy more.
5. The fifth tweet talks about AML (Andrea Michaelian), not breaking the $2 mark, but suggests a take-over and considers APLP (Apple Inc.) as part of that. This could be seen positively if there are rumors of收购活动.
6. The sixth tweet mentions the stock closing above 48, which is a bullish sign for some. It also talks about Facebook buying some shares at $80, suggesting they might buy BABA. This seems positive.
7. Another tweet from RT@USER mentions BABA's group holdings and a quote link. It doesn't specify any news, so it's probably neutral or negative if there are no relevant updates.
8. The seventh tweet discusses an explosion about to occur soon, leading to bullish momentum indicators like opening up. This could be very positive because chaos usually boosts stock prices.
9. The last tweet mentions a trade at $94 and selling at $81 in the first quarter, which is a downturn for the company. Investors might be concerned about the profitability of that trade, so this could be negative.

Now, combining these thoughts: There are positive tweets about potential increases, undervalued stocks, undervalued tech companies, take-over rumors, a planned acquisition, and a potential negative price drop. The mix is a bit confusing because some tweets are contradictory. However, the overall sentiment seems mixed but leans towards positive due to the speculative elements like undervaluation and possible future gains from take-overs or explosions.

I think it's a positive overall sentiment because while there are some negatives, the positives like undervalued stocks and potential expansion activities dominate. Investors might be cautiously optimistic about BABA's future."
2015-05-16,Positive,"Alright, I need to determine the impact on the future stock price based on the given tweets for a company. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the tweets, none have an explicit stock symbol except the first one, which is not clear. The second tweet mentions ""baba alibaba group holding ltd .,"" so that's the stock I should focus on: BABA.

Next, I'll go through each tweet to separate positive and negative factors.

1. **aep american elec pwr co . , inc . message board posts click here -> URL trending $ aep $ fslr $ baba $ xle aep …**
   - The user mentions ""message board"" which could be news or analysis. I don't see any positive or negative factors mentioned, so this might be neutral.

2. **baba alibaba group holding ltd . short sales click here -> URL trending $ baba $ vrx $ bidu $ csx baba pennystocks …**
   - The tweet has ""short sales,"" which could indicate investor interest but without a clear positive or negative tone, it's likely neutral.

3. **$ baba - hedge fund dumps alibaba URL**
   - This seems like an announcement of a strategic move by a hedge fund to dump AlphaUnit. Such moves can be seen as short-term gains for the stock, so this is probably positive.

4. **rt AT_USER eye of the tiger , baby ! $ goog $ pcln $ twtr $ fb $ aapl $ ebay $ gm $ dust $ baba URL URL**
   - The user mentions ""eye of the tiger,"" which could be a metaphorical sign, and a long position in APT (which is AlphaUnit). This seems like speculative buying, but it's vague. I'll assume this is positive.

5. **nflx netflix , inc . stock message board click here -> URL trending $ nflx $ vxx $ hpq $ baba nflx tradeideas stocks**
   - Netflix is a large company; the user mentions trading shares. This could be an indication of investor interest, so this is positive.

6. **baba alibaba group holding ltd . eod data click here -> URL trending $ baba $ itb $ vti $ mmrf baba nasdaq stocks**
   - ""EOD data"" suggests data release or earnings, which can indicate future performance. However, without explicit sentiment, it's considered neutral.

7. **baba alibaba group holding ltd . short sales click here -> URL trending $ baba $ hal $ data $ googl baba stocks …**
   - Similar to tweet 2 with short sales; moderate positive effect due to potential gains.

8. **mvg mag silver corp . prev close click here -> URL trending $ mvg $ ibb $ vltc $ baba mvg investing finance**
   - No explicit factors mentioned, so this is likely neutral.

Now, combining all these, the tweet from the hedge fund (3) and short selling activity (7) both indicate potential positive movements. However, there's also speculative news in tweet 4 about APT stock, which could be a short-term effect but not sure about sentiment. The other tweets are less conclusive.

Since most positive factors point towards BABA's strength and speculative buys, I'm leaning towards positive impact."
2015-05-17,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. So, I've been given six tweets, each with some information about different stocks. My task is to look at each one, identify the target stock symbol, break down each tweet into positive or negative factors, assess the sentiment based on those factors, and then combine everything to see if there's a general positive, neutral, or negative impact.

First, I need to extract the stock symbols from each tweet. Let me go through them one by one.

1. The first tweet is ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . e . p . s . click here -> URL trending $ baba $ son $ gld $ edc baba trade ideas stocks."" Hmm, this looks like it's related to BABA stock because I see 'baba' mentioned multiple times. So the target stock here is likely BABA.

2. The second tweet says ""mrnj metatron inc . bid size click here -> URL trending $ mrnj $ uup $ ewz $ baba mrnj … URL."" Okay, so this seems to be related to MRN (or maybe MRJ or another acronym), but I don't recognize the other words like UUP or EWZ. Maybe that's a typo. But regardless, it mentions BABA since 'baba' is in the URL again.

3. The third tweet: ""qld proshares ultra qqq fund bid click here -> URL trending $ qld $ fold $ bbby $ baba qld investing trade ideas."" Again, I see 'bbby,' which might be a typo or incorrect. But with 'baba' in the URL, it's likely BABA.

4. The fourth tweet is ""xlb energy select sector spdr last price click here -> URL trending $ xlb $ itc $ avk $ baba xlb pennystocks stock."" XLB seems to be an exchange rate or some other variable, but 'baba' is in the URL again.

5. The fifth tweet: ""akba akebia therapeutics , inc . volume click here -> URL trending $ akba $ mck $ evhc $ baba akba investing stocks."" This mentions AKBA (or maybe AKBA) and AKEBI, but 'baba' is in the URL.

6. The sixth tweet: ""rt AT_USER glw corning , inc . eod data click here -> URL trending $ glw $ nugt $ baba $ hnsn glw stock trade ideas."" Here, I see GLW and BABA as well. So this seems related to GLW stock.

Wait a minute, so each tweet is discussing different stocks: BABA, MRN, QLT, XLB, AKBA, and GLW. But the user mentioned ""a given company,"" which might mean that all these are related to the same company? Or maybe it's just six different companies in their tweets? Hmm.

But the output requires a single conclusion about the stock price of a given company. So perhaps I need to pick one company from this list and analyze its impact based on all six tweets.

Looking back at the initial instructions, each tweet is for a different stock. But maybe I'm supposed to consider that there's only one stock mentioned in the context of predicting the future price. Or perhaps the user provided multiple related stocks, but they want me to pick one and see how all these tweets affect its trend.

Wait, no, let me check again. The first tweet is about BABA, the second MRN (maybe a typo for BABA?), third QLT, fourth XLB, fifth AKBA, sixth GLW. So it's multiple stocks mentioned in different tweets.

I think maybe I need to look at each of these stocks individually and see their trends, but that seems complicated since there are six different stocks. Alternatively, perhaps the user provided all the information for a specific stock across these tweets, but from the way they're written, it's unclear which company is being referred to beyond BABA.

Wait, actually, looking back at the initial problem statement: ""Analyze the provided tweets to determine their likely impact on the future stock price of a given company."" So there must be one specific company whose stock these tweets are about. But in the first tweet, it's BABA, and then others. Maybe all these tweets are about different stocks but related to some company? Or perhaps they're all for the same company.

Alternatively, maybe the user meant that each tweet is about a different company related to a common theme or sector, but without more context, I can't tell which one to focus on.

Wait, looking again: Each tweet seems to be discussing a different stock. So perhaps it's six separate stocks, and the overall impact of all these tweets would affect multiple companies. But since the user is asking for the impact on ""a given company,"" maybe that company could be any of these six. However, without knowing which one, it's hard to assess.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that all six are about BABA, but some of them might have conflicting or conflicting information. For example, MRN and XLB are not related to BABA as far as I can tell. Maybe the user made a typo in mentioning MRN? Or it's an oversight.

Wait, looking again at the first tweet: It says ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . e . p . s . click here -> URL trending $ baba $ son $ gld $ edc baba trade ideas stocks."" So that's BABA. The second tweet mentions MRN (maybe MTR, but it doesn't seem relevant), UUP, EWZ—probably a typo or irrelevant. Then QLT, which might be another company.

Fourth is XLB and Penny stocks. AKBA could be related to energy companies. GLW and nugn seems like another stock.

So perhaps all these tweets are about different companies but the user wants me to focus on one of them, maybe BABA, because it's mentioned in all six? Or perhaps they're not all about BABA. Hmm.

I think I might need to pick a specific company. Let's assume that each tweet is referring to a separate stock related to a common sector or industry, but without knowing the exact context, it's challenging. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in listing multiple stocks and only intended for me to look at BABA since it's mentioned multiple times.

But the output requirement says to conclude with ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"" based on all six tweets. So perhaps I need to treat each tweet as contributing to the overall sentiment of a specific stock, but without knowing which one, this is tricky.

Wait, maybe all these tweets are about BABA despite mentioning other companies in the URLs. Let me check again:

1. BABA
2. Maybe MTR or similar.
3. QLT, possibly another company.
4. XLB and Penny stocks.
5. AKBA, perhaps a different energy stock.
6. GLW.

Alternatively, perhaps all these tweets are about the same company, but the URLs don't seem to indicate that. It's possible that each tweet is about a different company but relates to a common theme or sector.

Given this ambiguity, maybe I should focus on BABA since it's mentioned in multiple tweets and analyze its impact based on those related factors. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended all six to be part of a list for a specific stock.

Wait, looking back at the original problem statement: ""Analyze the provided tweets to determine their likely impact on the future stock price of a given company."" So it's about one company across multiple tweets. But in the first tweet, BABA is mentioned, and then other companies are mentioned elsewhere. Maybe all these tweets are for different stocks related to a common sector.

Alternatively, perhaps it's intended that each tweet is about a specific stock, but without more context, I can't know which one.

Given this uncertainty, maybe I should proceed by considering each tweet as contributing factors to the overall impact of BABA or another company. Since the user wants an answer based on these tweets, I'll assume that all are related to BABA despite some mention of other companies in the URLs.

Let me try that approach.

So, let's take BABA as the stock and analyze each tweet:

1. First tweet: Discusses trends for BABA.
2. Second tweet: Maybe MTR (maybe a different stock) but perhaps unrelated.
3. Third tweet: QLT, maybe another company.
4. Fourth tweet: XLB, Penny stocks—but XLB is a derivative security; Penny could be related to a different stock.
5. Fifth tweet: AKBA—energy-related.
6. Sixth tweet: GLW and nugn.

Wait, perhaps some of these are about BABA despite the mention in other words. For example:

1. First tweet: Discusses BABA's performance trends.
2. Second tweet: Maybe BABA is mentioned elsewhere?
3. Third tweet: Possibly a different stock or unrelated.
4. Fourth tweet: Possibly related to BABA but not directly.

Hmm, this is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants me to consider each of these tweets as factors for BABA's performance and see if they support an overall positive trend.

Let me proceed under the assumption that all these are about a specific company—maybe BABA—and analyze their impact based on given information.

So, without knowing which one is being referred to, perhaps I'll take BABA at face value since it's mentioned in multiple tweets. Let me check:

1. First tweet: Discusses trends for BABA.
2. Second tweet: Maybe MTR or something else.
3. Third tweet: QLT.
4. Fourth tweet: XLB and Penny stocks—maybe not directly related to BABA, but perhaps a different company's performance affecting BABA indirectly?
5. Fifth tweet: AKBA—maybe unrelated.
6. Sixth tweet: GLW.

Alternatively, maybe the user meant all these tweets are about BABA despite some mention of other companies in the URLs.

Wait, looking again at the fourth tweet: ""XLB penny stocks""—if XLB is a derivative security, it might impact BAAA's derivatives or options trading, but perhaps not directly. Similarly, Penny could be related to a different stock.

Given this confusion, perhaps I should proceed by considering each tweet as an indicator of trends for BABA and see if they all support a positive trend. Alternatively, maybe the user intended only one company across these tweets, so let me focus on that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look at each company individually but without knowing which one is referred to, this might not be feasible. So I think I need to take BABA as the main stock and see if all the given tweets support a positive trend for its price.

Let me proceed accordingly:

1. First tweet: Discusses trends for BABA—probably positive.
2. Second tweet: Maybe MTR or another unrelated company. Since it doesn't mention BABA, maybe negative? Or neutral?
3. Third tweet: QLT—maybe related to energy or something else. Could be either positive or negative.
4. Fourth tweet: XLB and Penny stocks—maybe related to derivatives but not directly affecting BABA. If they're good for derivatives, it might help BAAA's position in derivatives, which could indirectly affect BABA if there are connections.
5. Fifth tweet: AKBA—energy companies. Maybe positive or negative based on market conditions.
6. Sixth tweet: GLW and nugn—maybe unrelated.

Given that, perhaps the tweets about XLB (a derivative) and penny stocks might be positive for derivatives, which could benefit BAAA if they can use these to speculate or hedge. Similarly, AKBA's energy stocks could impact BAAA if there are energy-related strategies in place.

However, without knowing the exact context of each tweet, it's difficult to assign a specific sentiment. So maybe I should look at the information given about each company:

- BABA: Discusses trends for 14 weeks, shows price movement from $25 to $30.
- MTR: No mention of BABA or any relation—probably neutral.
- QLT: Discusses stock performance.
- XLB: Discusses derivatives and prices.
- Penny stocks: Maybe derivatives as well.

So, perhaps the tweets about BABA (first tweet) is positive, the ones about other companies like MTR, QLT, XLB, penny are either positive or neutral. So if the trends for BABA show upward movement over a month, that's a good sign.

However, since multiple tweets mention unrelated companies, I'm not sure how much weight they have on BABA's stock price.

Alternatively, perhaps each tweet is referring to different companies, but all connected to energy or derivatives—so it's hard to tell the overall trend for one company.

Wait, given that the user asked about a given company and provided six tweets, perhaps some are related. Let me read them again:

1. Discusses trends for BABA.
2. MTR: Maybe unrelated.
3. QLT: Probably unrelated.
4. XLB (derivative) and Penny stocks (maybe derivatives).
5. AKBA: Energy companies.
6. GLW: Maybe another energy company.

So, perhaps BABA is being discussed in the first tweet as positive, while other tweets about MTR, QLT, penny are either neutral or negative but don't directly relate to BABA.

In that case, if the trends for BABA are positive over a month, it could be an indicator of a positive overall market trend. But since some tweets are about unrelated companies, their sentiment doesn't directly impact BABA's performance.

Alternatively, perhaps BABA is also being discussed in other tweets, but I don't see them mentioned. So without specific information on all six tweets affecting the same company, it's hard to conclude a positive overall trend for BABA based solely on these tweets.

Therefore, perhaps the best approach is to state that while certain trends and mentions indicate potential for positive movements (like BABA's price increasing over time), other tweets about unrelated companies do not provide enough information to confirm a specific sentiment on BABA. Therefore, it might be difficult to determine an overall positive trend based solely on these six tweets.

Alternatively, perhaps the first tweet is the only one related to BABA, and if its trends show upward movement, that's a good sign. But without more information about other related tweets or context, it's speculative.

In conclusion, given that some of the provided tweets are discussing unrelated companies and others are specific but not directly tied to BABA, I can't conclusively determine a positive trend for BABA based solely on these six tweets. There might be other factors at play, such as macroeconomic trends or industry developments, that could either support or hinder the stock's performance.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The user asked about a given company and provided six tweets, each discussing different aspects of it. Let me look again:

1. First tweet: Discusses BABA's price over 14 weeks—positive trend.
2. Second tweet: MTR or other unrelated company.
3. Third tweet: QLT (maybe energy or another unrelated company).
4. Fourth tweet: XLB and Penny stocks—possibly derivatives, which could be positive if the market is in a good state.
5. Fifth tweet: AKBA—energy companies, perhaps positive for BAAA's position.
6. Sixth tweet: GLW—energy companies, possibly related.

So, if I look at these, the only mention of BABA is in the first tweet. The other tweets are about different sectors or unrelated companies. Therefore, without specific information about how each of these companies affects BAAA, it's hard to see a trend for BABA.

Given that, perhaps the only positive trend visible from these tweets is the one on BABA itself—its price increasing over time. But since it's not clear whether the other tweets' sentiment aligns with BABA's performance, I can't make a definitive conclusion about its overall movement.

Alternatively, maybe some of these tweets are part of a broader analysis or report that could provide context, but without more information on how they're correlated to BAAA, I can't assess their impact.

In summary, the first tweet shows BABA has seen an increase in price over 14 weeks, which is positive. The other tweets mention unrelated companies, so it's unclear if those are contributing factors or not. Therefore, I can only conclude that BABA's own performance shows upward trends but can't be certain of the overall movement based on these tweets alone."
2015-05-18,Negative,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze the impact of these tweets on a company's stock price. The user provided some tweets and wants me to determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative for their stock. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at each tweet one by one. 

1. The first tweet is about ""baba"" which seems like a stock name. It mentions fetching company info and some currencies. Not sure what's going on here—maybe just information? That doesn't ring a bell for stock sentiment.
   
2. Second tweet says ""$ baba sell buys bita the best chna."" This sounds like someone is selling their baba stock or maybe buying it. If there's a direct mention of selling, that could be negative because selling might indicate concerns about growth or profitability.

3. Third tweet mentions ""baba alibaba group holding ltd"" with some currencies and volume info. It seems like another information-only tweet without specific business updates.

4. Fourth tweet is about ""fastest growing & most profitable new companies are asset-free connection platforms."" So, the company is expected to be doing well since they're in a sector that's expanding. This could mean positive because they might see increased demand or lower competition.

5. Fifth tweet talks about ""erx direxion daily energy bull 3x shares bid click here"" with a URL. It mentions an energy stock being bought, which could indicate a potential move in the market—maybe positive if people are watching energy prices for their investments.

6. Sixth tweet is about the fake-goods lawsuit against Alibaba and includes some information about it. This seems like bad news because a big company facing such issues might lower investor confidence or reduce shares. Negative sentiment likely here.

7. Seventh tweet mentions ""top 4 signs the stock is a scam."" If they're signaling something is wrong, this could directly impact the stock negatively as investors would be wary of such situations.

8. Eighth tweet says ""alibaba is being sued by alibaba owner for fakes ... again."" Another lawsuit announcement, likely further negative news affecting their stock.

9. Ninth tweet has a bunch of stock symbols and metrics about sentiment. The numbers might indicate positive trends in some areas but if others are negative or unrelated, it could be mixed, leading to an overall negative impact.

10. Tenth tweet talks about diversified holdings for 52 weeks with low click-through rates. This seems like poor news because lower traffic could mean declining interest, which is a red flag against growth potential—negative sentiment.

Now, summarizing the impacts: tweets 4 and 7 point to positive growth expectations, while 6 and 8 are about serious legal issues. Tweets 9 and 10 concern future demand. However, tweet 2 might indicate sell pressure but it's more of a general trend without specific details on baba.

Considering all these factors—good news from 4 and 7, bad news from 6, 8, 9, 10, and some neutral from the others—I think overall sentiment is negative. The company faces several significant issues that could negatively impact their performance."
2015-05-19,Missing,File not found
2015-05-20,Neutral,"Okay, I need to figure out how to determine the impact on the stock price of baba based on the provided tweets. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually.

The first tweet mentions a URL trending and several exchange rates for BABA. This seems like just a normal market update, so probably not too influential.

Second tweet has multiple dollar signs and slashes without specific info. It's vague, but maybe it's indicating some trading activity or user engagement.

Third tweet talks about games being on, but then mentions ""r / g here."" I'm not sure what that refers to. Maybe it's unrelated or confusing.

Fourth tweet is about Yahoo stock relative to BABA and mentions tax fears. This seems like a serious news event related to financials. If investors fear taxes going up, that could affect the stock price negatively.

Fifth tweet talks about a callbot adding a block and mentioning price movements. It says traders are ""wow how they manipulate!"" The mention of manipulating suggests possible manipulation, which is generally seen as negative for stock prices.

Sixth tweet just adds a new comment on BABA without details. It might indicate some trading activity, but not much specific info to drive the price up or down.

Seventh and eighth tweets have links and mentions of $baba being at a certain price. They talk about the stock's performance—positive trend but seem uncertain if it will pull back.

Putting this together: There are both positive and negative elements. The tax-related news is significant, and some manipulation suggests potential negative impact. However, the overall trend in the last tweet is upward with a small callblock move. It's mixed; some factors support a slight increase, but others add uncertainty."
2015-05-21,Positive,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. The user provided a set of tweets and wants me to analyze them step by step.

First, let's list out the steps they outlined: identify the target stock from the tweets, then analyze each tweet for positive or negative factors, assess sentiment, and combine those into an overall sentiment summary. They even gave examples on how to process the tweets, so I'll follow that structure.

Looking at the tweets:

1. The first tweet mentions investing in $bzun IPO but it's mostly just a URL without specific stock symbols.
2. Second tweet talks about ""outperform"" with Bernstein as a target, which seems positive.
3. Third tweet is a quote from Bernstein about their IPO performance.
4. Fourth tweet lists several tech stocks: alibaba, ebay, baba, etc., indicating coverage of these companies.
5. Fifth tweet mentions needing to run and suggests AAPL for ABBVYY.
6. Sixth tweet repeats ""jotaibi 61"" with various stock names in a list. Doesn't seem like a news event here.
7. Seventh tweet is about $baba's IPO, open at 90.92, high at 94.77, suggesting ongoing news.
8. Eighth tweet discusses Alibaba shares being cheap and mentions several other stocks: alibaba, ebay, baba. Again, stock coverage.
9. Ninth tweet refers to risks for alibaba, yhoo, amzn if Bernstein thinks they'll do well but mentions a Bernsteins lay them down? Not sure about that.
10. Tenth tweet talks about the S&P 500, Dalai network, ual stock index, etc., not specific stocks.
11. Eleventh tweet says baba has gone up by 6.99%, which is positive news.
12. Twelfth tweet mentions Bernstein as a target with $120 price on mobile monetization growth for Alibaba.
13. Thirteenth tweet refers to volume weighted average (VWA) since the IPO, suggesting potential resistance if VWA continues.
14. Fourteenth tweet starts Bernsteins initiating Alibaba at 120 per share.

So the target stock isn't directly given in any of these tweets, so I need to make an educated guess based on the context. From the content, mentions of Alibaba, ABBVYY (which is AAPL), and other tech companies like baba suggest that baba might be a company or perhaps part of Alibaba's portfolio.

Now, analyzing each tweet:

1. First tweet: No specific stock symbol.
2. Second: Positive target from Bernstein but no stock mentioned.
3. Third: Quote from Bernstein about their IPO performance.
4. Fourth: Coverage of several tech stocks.
5. Fifth: Suggesting buy ABBVYY for Alibaba's APEX share.
6. Sixth: No relevant info.
7. Seventh: mentions $baba IPO but no specific stock symbol.
8. Eighth: Coverage of Alibaba and other companies.
9. Ninth: Bernsteins concern about alibaba, yhoo, amzn risks if they perform well.
10. Tenth: S&P 500 etc., not relevant.
11. Eleventh: Positive news on baba's price movement.
12. Twelfth: Bernstein target with $120 per share.
13. Thirteenth: VWA since IPO suggests potential for resistance.
14. Fourteenth: Bernsteins initiating at 120 per share.

Overall, the tweets mention the company in coverage (like ABBVYY), targets or mentions of other tech companies via Bernstein, which can be positive or negative depending on the perspective. The most impactful ones seem to be the mentions of ABBVYY, Bernstein's targets, and baba's IPO prices. However, without knowing if these are good or bad news for baba, it's hard to determine sentiment.

Considering that some tweets are about potential resistance (like volume weighted average) and others are about price movements, which can be either positive or negative in the broader market but might have a local impact on specific stocks.

Given the context of ABBVYY being mentioned, Bernstein as a target for shares, and baba's IPO performance, it's possible these are positive signals that could push stock prices up. However, without knowing the exact sentiment from each tweet, it's challenging to be certain.

So, I think the overall impact is likely Positive because of mentions of potential resistance and Bernstein targets, which can indicate confidence in the company or market."
2015-05-22,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to figure out their impact on a company's stock price. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions several stocks and has some metrics, but nothing specific about the target stock.
2. The second tweet talks about eog resources and eod's filing, which might relate to a company's news or regulatory changes.
3. Third tweet mentions boja and baba, possibly related to another company.
4. Fourth tweet is about cboe and other companies, which could be about market trends or stock performance.
5. Fifth tweet discusses bosocial going back to the user account, maybe indicating user sentiment.
6. Sixth tweet introduces Alibaba's comeback, suggesting a positive reaction from users.
7. Seventh tweet mentions baba reaching a high level but details are unclear.
8. Eighth tweet is aboutVisit Hai Vai pharmaceuticals, which might relate to their financial health.
9. Ninth tweet mentions shak and shack, possibly related to the stock's performance or trends.
10. Tenth tweet discusses wmt and wal-mart, again, something specific but not clearly tied to a target company.

The main ones that touch on a specific company are tweets 2 through 10. Looking at tweet 6 about Alibaba's comeback, it might indicate user satisfaction or positive news. But it's also speculative because the user account can be misleading. Similarly, tweet 7 mentions baba reaching a high but details aren't clear.

Considering overall sentiment based on these tweets, there seems to be some optimism from the comeback and the stock being discussed in higher terms. However, without concrete information about the target company, it's hard to make a definite conclusion. It might not outweigh other factors like recent earnings reports or broader market trends. So, leaning towards a Neutral stance."
2015-05-23,Neutral,"Alright, I need to determine how the given tweets affect the future stock price of a company. The user has provided four tweets and wants me to analyze them step by step.

First, looking at each tweet:

1. ""smm - via : topedigiworks : $ baba alibaba URL … … digitalmarketing strategist socialmedia … URL""

This tweet mentions ""topedigiworks"" which I recognize as a company known for developing AI-driven solutions and AI-powered software. The mention of digital marketing strategies and social media presence might indicate that the author is involved in the tech sector, possibly related to AI or data analytics.

2. ""smm - via : topedigiworks : $ baba alibaba URL … … digitalmarketing strategist socialmedia … URL""

Similar to the first tweet, it again refers to ""topedigiworks."" The same context as the first one might be repeating information or possibly indicating a deeper engagement with the company in the tech field.

3. ""smm - via : topedigiworks : $ baba alibaba URL … … digitalmarketing strategist socialmedia … URL""

Again, this tweet is consistent with the previous ones, focusing on ""topedigiworks."" The term ""digital"" might suggest the use of AI in online platforms or services.

4. ""smm - via : topedigiworks : $ baba alibaba URL … … digitalmarketing strategist socialmedia … URL""

This one is the same as the first three tweets, just restating a similar point about ""topedigiworks."" It doesn't provide any new information beyond what's already mentioned.

Now, considering all these tweets are focused on ""topedigiworks,"" which seems to be a tech-related company involved in AI and data analytics. The posts might include detailed information about their strategic marketing efforts or social media presence that could influence investor sentiment towards the stock.

If ""topedigiworks"" is a reputable company with strong financials, positive news about their technology could boost investor confidence. On the other hand, if there's negative news related to AI (like a loss in revenue from data usage), it could hurt the stock price.

However, since each tweet is repeating similar content without providing any specific analysis or quote, I can't determine the actual impact on the stock price. The lack of context makes it difficult to assess whether the tweets are positive, neutral, or negative.

Therefore, based solely on the provided information, I cannot conclude whether these tweets positively, neutrally, or negatively affect the stock price of ""topedigiworks."" More detailed analysis would be needed to make an accurate assessment."
2015-05-24,Neutral,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how these tweets are going to affect the stock price of HPQ, which is ticker symbol $hpq. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol $hpq, that's not something I can access directly. But the user has provided a list of tweets, so maybe those can help. Each tweet seems to be about various stocks and topics like market analysis, different companies, etc.

But wait, all these tweets seem to be listing out multiple stocks in the same query: $hpq, t, abev, bac, intc, etc. That's a lot of stocks for just one tweet. Hmm, maybe that's part of the query parameter? Or is it a mistake?

Wait, no, looking back at the initial instruction, I see that each tweet has its own target stock and topic. So perhaps each line represents a different company with their own analysis or update.

Let me count how many tweets are there: 11 lines in total. Each line starts with ""rt AT_USER [ video ] weekend us market analysis"" followed by various stock codes. That doesn't seem right because it's repeating the same set of stocks every time, which might be a mistake or perhaps HPQ isn't even part of that query.

Wait, maybe all these are related to different stocks? Or perhaps this is about multiple topics being analyzed on one day?

Hmm, I'm getting confused. Maybe each tweet is just about its own stock. But the user didn't specify that. The initial instruction says ""the likely impact on the future stock price of a given company,"" so maybe HPQ isn't among these tweets.

But then how do we analyze it? Since none of the tweets are about $hpq, this is confusing. Maybe the user intended to provide specific stocks but made an error. Or perhaps all these are part of a market analysis or stock pick list for other companies.

Wait, looking back at the output requirement: you need to conclude with a single line about [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. But if none of the tweets mention HPQ, then how can we assess its impact? Maybe it's irrelevant because none are related to HPQ.

Alternatively, maybe all these are part of an external query and not specific to HPQ. So without knowing what each tweet is about, I can't determine its effect on HPQ.

But since the user provided this as a task, perhaps they just want me to analyze based on what's given, even if it doesn't directly affect HPQ. Maybe all these are about other stocks or topics.

Alternatively, maybe there was an error in copying the tweets. But regardless, I need to provide an answer as per the initial instructions.

I think the best approach is to state that with no information on the impact of these tweets on $hpq, it's impossible to determine the sentiment. However, since all the provided tweets don't mention HPQ, they can't influence its price.

But wait, maybe the user forgot to include HPQ in one of the lines. Alternatively, perhaps this is a trick question where HPQ isn't part of the analysis, so there's no data available.

In any case, based on what I have, without knowing if any of these tweets are about $hpq or how they affect it, I can't make an accurate prediction. So maybe the answer should be [Neutral] because there's no information to influence that stock's price.

Alternatively, perhaps all these tweets are part of a different analysis, and HPQ isn't mentioned, so again, [Neutral] is appropriate.

I think that's the best conclusion I can draw from the given data. Without any information on $hpq or its relationship with these tweets, it's impossible to assess the sentiment impact."
2015-05-25,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of BABA. 

Looking at the first tweet, it just mentions some stock symbols and URLs without any positive or negative keywords. It's more about providing information rather than giving a clear opinion. So, I'm leaning towards this as [Neutral].

The second tweet adds more info but still doesn't state whether the stock is up or down. So again, [Neutral] makes sense here.

Third tweet talks about holding BABA and mentions some ETFs, which are investment vehicles. This shows that people are considering buying but don't necessarily express a sentiment yet. It's [Neutral].

The fourth tweet points out that scrapiron is the end of September 2015, which might indicate an upcoming event that could impact stock prices, especially in the tech or financial sectors where scrapiron was mentioned. While there's some news, it doesn't specify if this will be positive or negative for BABA. So I'll consider this [Neutral].

Fifth tweet mentions JPMorgan Chase and talks about investing. This is a company well-known in finance, but without context on how BABA relates to them, the sentiment is uncertain. It could go either way.

Sixth tweet talks about penny stocks moving quickly, which might suggest that demand for cheaper or more innovative assets is rising. This could affect BABA, so it's possible this could have a positive impact, leading me to [Neutral] again but maybe leaning towards positive due to the tech sector's current trends.

Seventh tweet mentions psec proshares and Ultra QQQ fund. These are investment funds, so they might indicate market interest or sentiment, possibly positive if BABA is performing well there.

Eighth tweet focuses on Treasury yields and dividend payments for TMV stock. While these are financial metrics, without knowing how they affect BABA, it's hard to gauge the impact directly.

Putting it all together, while some tweets do suggest potential events affecting stock performance (like scrapiron or tech sectors), others don't express clear sentiment. The overall sentiment might be a mix of positive and neutral, but leaning more towards [Neutral] as the most accurate since it's based on less specific information."
2015-05-26,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the company in question. Let me break down each tweet and see what they're saying.

First, I need to extract the stock symbol from each tweet. That seems straightforward since the symbols are right there at the end of some lines. For example, ""sltd shares company info URL"" means the stock is sltd. Then, for the next one, it's $soxl and sox... which probably refers to silver trust stock.

I remember that from before when I did this analysis. Each tweet gives different factors and their sentiments towards the stock. The first step was identifying each positive or negative factor in each tweet. For instance, ""sltd shares company info URL"" might be a positive because it's providing information about the company.

Next, assessing sentiment by looking at how each tweet affects investor confidence. If all the tweets are encouraging and positive, that would probably be a positive overall impact on the stock price. But if there's any negative or contradictory information, that could tip it to neutral or negative.

Looking through the tweets, I see some mentions of silver trust stocks, bull markets, semiconductor companies, investments, earnings reports, and cryptocurrency prices. Silver has been rising recently due to economic factors, so maybe that suggests positive trends for the company. BULL 3X shares might mean strong expectations from investors.

The user is involved a lot in these tweets, with repeated mentions of $baba. That could indicate engagement or confidence among investors who follow the user. The mention of bull stocks and investments might suggest they think the stock is undervalued.

There's also some talking about semiconductors, which are often booming sectors. If the company is in a good position for that sector, that would be positive. Also, mentions of cryptocurrency could mean a mix of trends, but I'm not sure if that's positive or negative unless it affects the stock.

Some tweets just have links and no information, which might be neutral. Others talk about expanding their ecosystem to connect various technologies, which is positive for growth potential. The mention of an IP ozzuput could indicate a mix of expectations.

Putting this all together: Positive factors like semiconductors, bull stocks, investments, and crypto seem to be in the tweets. But there are a few negative points about silver stocks or lack of information that might pull it down. However, considering the overall trend of tech and semiconductor companies, which are strong sectors, and the user's consistent engagement, the positive aspects outweigh any negatives.

I think most investors would see the company as performing well in their market expectations for semiconductors and the potential expansion they're doing. So, I'm leaning towards a positive impact."
2015-05-27,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided a set of tweets and asked for an assessment using ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"".

First, I'll need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet: ""$ aapl $ baba : alibaba group holding and facebook inc . brands are gaining on ..."". It seems like the stock in question is ABBV (Alibaba Group), so I should focus on their sentiment towards ABBV.

Next, each tweet is separate with factors mentioned. I'll go through them one by one. 

1. The first tweet talks about Facebook's brand performance and mentions Apple gaining. While it's not explicitly positive or negative towards ABBV itself, it might influence other investors.
2. The second tweet includes a lot of stock ticker symbols but doesn't mention the target stock ABBV, so I can skip this one.
3. Third tweet discusses investing in AT_USER's stocks, which isn't related to ABBV, so no impact here.
4. Fourth tweet is about buy orders on Vuzi and Insy, which could be affecting other stocks, not directly ABBV.
5. Fifth tweet talks about stock performance on TBOT (Twquirrel) and ETFs, again unrelated.
6. Sixth tweet mentions ABBV's investment message, which might influence the sentiment towards them but doesn't specify the action.
7. The seventh tweet seems to be a news announcement from Apple about investing in Facebook, so it could affect investor sentiment towards ABBV or related stocks.
8. Eighth tweet is about SPXU stock using ultrapro short S&P 500, which is unrelated.
9. Ninth tweet mentions DJIA and some ETFs, not relevant.

Now, focusing on the relevant tweets for ABBV: The fourth and sixth are tangential, but the seventh talks about investing in Facebook, which could have positive or negative effects depending on market sentiment. However, since it's a news announcement from Apple, it might indicate broader market conditions that could impact ABBV.

Putting this together, I think the tweet from July 25th (the one with ""cash is a knight"") discusses investing in Facebook but doesn't specify positive or negative actions towards ABBV. The sixth tweet talks about investment messages, which can have mixed effects. Without specific data on sentiment shifts due to these tweets, it's hard to classify as clearly positive, negative, or neutral.

So, considering the limited information and the fact that none of the tweets directly mention ABBV but touch on Facebook, I might lean towards a neutral assessment because without clear positive or negative statements, there's uncertainty in the overall sentiment."
2015-05-28,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on BABA's stock price. First, I need to look at each tweet individually and break them down into positive and negative factors.

Starting with the first tweet: ""placements financiers - forex : $ baba alibaba url"". It seems like it's about a financial company called PlacementsFinancers holding Alpha Balances, which is based in China. The mention of forex might not directly relate to BABA, so I think this could be considered neutral or maybe negative because it doesn't seem related to the stock.

Moving on to tweet 2: ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . eod data URL $ baba $ hznp $ fxe $ ffn.to baba stock invest"". This one mentions a company called BABA Group Holding Ltd. They are investing in some funds, which is a significant action that could influence investor sentiment, especially if they think the company is undervalued. That might lean towards positive.

Next tweet 3: ""gg goldcorp , inc . yield URL $ gg $ googl $ uvxy $ baba gg investing tradeideas"". They're talking about Gold Corp with a yield of 15%, but this seems unrelated to BABA stock. Maybe the yield is just additional info, so I'll consider it neutral.

Tweet 4: ""nutt direxion daily gold miners bull 3x shares bid URL $ nutt $ baba $ baba $ vti nutt invest stockmarket"". They're buying 3xshares from Nutt Directusion as part of the daily gold mining segment. That's a direct investment action, which is positive because it shows they're taking an active position in the company.

Tweet 5: ""$ ssys startin to rally off bottom $ fb $ yy $ hpq $ fsi $ z $ box $ dis $ jblu $ mbly $ msft $ nflx $ cmg $ baba $ zu $ mu $ f $ gm $ ba $ sune $ rtn $ ddd $ gpro $ baba"". This tweet is talking about a rally off the bottom for SNSY, FB, YYY, HPQ, FSI, Z, Box, DIS, JBLU, MBLY, MSFT, NFLX, CMG, BABA, ZU, MU, F, GM, BA, SUNE, RTN, DD, GPRO. These are all tech and financial companies, not related to BABA. So this tweet is a bit of a mix but seems like a positive indicator across different sectors. Maybe overall positive.

Tweet 6: ""vwo vanguard emerging markets vipers prev close URL $ vwo $ plug $ baba $ hedj vwo tradeideas finance"". They're looking at the performance of VVW stock as part of the VVW index. This could indicate market sentiment towards certain assets, but without specific info on BABA's performance, it's hard to assess. Maybe slight negative if they think VVW is undervalued.

Tweet 7: ""vwesx vanguard long-term corporate fund exchange URL $ vwesx $ gld $ xlf $ baba vwesx stocks stockmarket"". Similar to tweet 3, this seems to be about a Vanguard Fund, but again unrelated to BABA. So neutral or maybe positive if they're investing in the fund for BABA.

Now, compiling these thoughts: Some tweets are directly related to BABA (tweets 4 and possibly others), while others don't touch on the stock at all. Positive tweets include tweet 2 about investment actions and tweet 5 about a rally. Negative could be any unrelated tweets or those that don't provide much info. Neutral would be tweets without clear sentiment.

Looking at the overall, there are significant positive actions like investing in BABA (tweet 4) and SNSY (tweet 5), but some unrelated tweets could make it uncertain. I think there's enough positive activity for a positive sentiment."
2015-05-29,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of BABA stock. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. It seems like many of them mention ""baba alibaba group holding ltd."" and ""baba finance nasdaq,"" so I think that's the stock we're looking at here. So the target is BABA.

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. Let me go through them one by one.

1. The first tweet has ""$ baba $ cmg $ uso $ xlb baba nasdaq stocks"". That mentions CMG, USO, XLB, and BABA. CMG is a ETF, so that might be mixed in with other assets. USO could mean something positive or neutral? XLB doesn't ring a bell as a strong positive factor.

2. The second tweet says ""$ baba $ cslt $ jnug $ uwti baba stockmarket stocks"". CSM is a crypto exchange, which can fluctuate and sometimes be negative because of regulatory issues. JHN (or JNUG) is a ETF I'm less familiar with; maybe neutral? UWT is another crypto-related ETF, possibly mixed.

3. The third tweet: ""$ hpq $ baba $ clf $ aks $ tsm $ kgc $ orcl $ spy $ qqq URL"". HPQ is part of the SPY (S&P 500), which is an index, so that's positive because it's tracking major market movement. CLF and AKS could be ETFs, but I'm not sure if they're generally positive. TSM is a stock on the NYSE, possibly mixed or maybe positive? KGC is a cryptocurrency; crypto can be volatile. ORCL is Oracle, which I think has strong fundamentals. SQ is another index from SPY.

4. The fourth tweet: ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . day low URL $ baba $ xhb $ xly $ ewz baba finance nasdaq"". It says it's a day low, so maybe indicating potential buying pressure or fear. XHB and XYL could be futures or ETFs; EFW is another ETF I'm less sure about.

5. The fifth tweet compares $ twtr vs. $ baba vs. ... etc., across nine measures. That seems more complex and not specific to BABA, so maybe less relevant for the target stock's sentiment alone.

6. Similarly, the sixth tweet is a comparison between $ twtr vs. other stocks, again not about BABA.

7. The seventh tweet mentions ""the end of the honeymoon"" as a sign that BABA might be down. That seems like a clear negative indicator because it suggests potential selling pressure or fear among investors.

Looking at all these, I see that the first tweet has some mixed factors but includes CMG and USO which are not major trends for a stock's performance. The third tweet is positive with HPQ (SPY) and ORCL, which could drive prices. The seventh tweet adds a strong negative outlook suggesting BABA might be down.

Considering all these tweets together, especially the seventh one which clearly mentions the end of the honeymoon, it suggests that the market is worried about BABA and may cause short-term drops. While there are mixed factors in others, this particular tweet has a clear negative impact."
2015-05-30,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out the user's query. So, they provided some tweets about a stock and asked me to analyze their impact on the stock price. The output should be either Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

First, I need to see what each tweet is saying. Let me list them out:

1. ""xom exxon mobil corp . p / e ratio URL $ xom $ baba $ swks $ iwm xom stocks nasdaq""
2. ""eem ishares msci emerging markets ideas URL $ eem $ fb $ ^ esm 15 $ baba eem share invest""
3. ""cien ciena corp . p / e ratio URL $ cien $ pwrd $ rusl $ baba cien stock stock""
4. ""odfl old dominion freight line , inc . dividend URL $ odfl $ baba $ fxa $ intc odfl stocks pennystocks""

Okay, so each tweet seems to be related to a company: XOM, EEM, CEN, and ODFL.

Now, the process is to identify the target stock. The first tweet mentions ""xom exxon mobil corp . p / e ratio URL $ xom $ baba $ swks $ iwm xom stocks nasdaq."" So, XOM is the target stock symbol here.

Next, I need to parse each tweet for positive and negative factors. Let's go through them one by one.

1. For ""xom exxon mobil corp . p / e ratio URL $ xom $ baba $ swks $ iwm xom stocks nasdaq"":
   - Positive factors: p/e ratio, NASDAQ, XOM.
   - Negative factors: The URL part might not be relevant unless it's a typo or irrelevant. So likely positive.

2. ""eem ishares msci emerging markets ideas URL $ eem $ fb $ ^ esm 15 $ baba eem share invest"":
   - Positive: EEM (EMF), MSCI, ideas.
   - Negative: Maybe the 15%? Not sure. It's a stock symbol.
   
3. ""cien ciena corp . p / e ratio URL $ cien $ pwrd $ rusl $ baba cien stock stock"":
   - Positive: p/e ratio, CEN, CINTA.
   - Negative: The URL could be a typo or irrelevant.

4. ""odfl old dominion freight line , inc . dividend URL $ odfl $ baba $ fxa $ intc odfl stocks pennystocks"":
   - Positive: dividend, ODFL.
   - Negative: No obvious negatives here. It seems positive.

Now, I need to assess sentiment for each tweet. The overall effect on the stock would depend on how many tweets are positive or negative and their relative strength.

Looking at XOM:
- Positive factors include p/e ratio, NASDAQ, which is a good sign.
- EEM: Maybe downgraded by investors, so some negative.
- CEN: p/e ratio again; unclear.
- ODFL: Dividend, but not sure about its impact yet.

So overall, the positives (p/e, NASDAQ, dividend) outweigh the negatives. But I'm not entirely certain because sometimes stock performance isn't solely determined by a few factors.

Considering the multiple positive points and one possible negative like EEM, I lean towards a Positive overall sentiment for XOM."
2015-05-31,Negative,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided a set of tweets and wants an analysis on their likely impact on a stock's future price. They've given specific instructions: identify the stock symbol, analyze each tweet into positive and negative factors, assess sentiment, and then summarize overall sentiment as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

First, I need to extract the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the tweets, there are some mentions of BABA (short for Bank of America), like in tweet 4 where it's called ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . ex-div date URL $ baba $ smh $ tna $ swrf baba share nasdaq."" So, the target stock is BABA.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one. Let me list them out and see if any other stocks are mentioned except for BABA. Tweets 1 mentions nwbo, but that's a different company, so probably not relevant unless they're related to BABA, which I don't think is the case here.

Tweet 2 talks about AT_USER xli industrialist. That doesn't seem directly related. 

Tweet 3 discusses back and fill this week with institutions, focusing on stocks trading money under companies like SPY and QQQ. Again, no mention of BABA except in tweet 4 where it's mentioned as ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . ex-div date URL $ baba $ smh $ tna $ swrf baba share nasdaq."" So the only relevant stock here is BABA.

Tweet 4 talks about Yahoo and short sales, mentioning ""ex-div date"" which could be related to dividends or stock splits. That doesn't seem directly related to BABA.

Tweet 5 refers to BABA shares rose the most in a year, but I need more context unless it's part of a trend.

Tweet 6 is about DAKT and DJALU for trade ideas, so again, no direct link to BABA.

Tweet 7 mentions _hyg short sales. Short sales can indicate investor sentiment, potentially positive or negative depending on the intent.

So, focusing on tweet 4 where it specifically mentions BABA, ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . ex-div date URL $ baba $ smh $ tna $ swrf baba share nasdaq,"" seems like a direct mention. This suggests that investors are concerned about BABA's financials or upcoming events related to it.

In this case, since the tweet is discussing ""rose the most in a year"" and mentions short sales, which can be seen as a negative sign because short selling is often associated with concerns about lack of confidence in security prices. It might indicate uncertainty about BABA's performance or future prospects.

Putting it all together, while some positive points are mentioned (like the rise in BABA shares), the mention of short sales and lack of clarity on future events makes me lean towards a negative sentiment overall."
2015-06-01,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the company based on the given criteria. Let me start by breaking down each tweet and understanding what information they're conveying.

Looking at tweet 1, it mentions a US dollar exchange rate affecting gold prices and several ETFs including financials. This could influence investor sentiment regarding global markets and related sectors like finance or energy. But without specific context on the company's performance, it's hard to tell if this is positive, neutral, or negative.

Tweet 2 talks about cryptocurrency exchanges like fxi and gpro, which are known for their volatility. They might impact trading volumes but don't directly mention the company itself. This could lead some investors to trade cryptocurrencies, which may not be favorable for a stock price unless the company is in that sector.

Tweet 3 discusses Alibaba's mobile payments service winning in China, which affects their revenue and market position. This could boost their financials, potentially positively affecting the stock price. However, it's also a positive aspect rather than negative.

Tweet 4 mentions a weekly call for BABA, which seems like a specific event related to the stock trading activity. While this might affect trading volume and liquidity, it doesn't provide direct information about market performance or company performance.

Finally, tweet 5 talks about ocr solutions, which is known for financial services. Their earnings could impact stock prices depending on the company's product line and profitability. This could either be a positive sign if they're doing well or a negative if they're struggling.

Putting this together, some tweets are about market trends affecting ETFs and cryptocurrencies, while others are specific to BABA trading activity or ocr solutions. Without more context on how these tweets relate to the company's actual performance, it's challenging to assess a clear overall sentiment. There could be elements of positive (like mobile payments and earnings reports) that might balance out negative impacts from crypto or ETFs. So, I think the overall impact is neutral."
2015-06-02,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a given company. The user provided five tweets and an example output. Let me break this down step by step.

First, each tweet seems to be related to different factors or events connected to a specific stock symbol. But since the target stock isn't specified here, I'll have to make some assumptions based on the words in the tweets. Looking at the first tweet: ""xli industrials select sector spdr change URL $ xli $ baba $ ea $ ung xli nasdaq stocks."" It mentions xli, which could be Xly Industries or something related.

The second tweet is about BABA, with sentiment ""-1"". The third includes BABA, TSLA, YGE, and others. The fourth tweet talks about GMCR, which I know is a financial services company, and EEM stock. The fifth mentions BABA again but also TAobao and something about auctioning off bad debt.

I'm not sure which stock symbol is the target here because each tweet could be referring to different stocks. Maybe they're all related, or perhaps it's a typo. Since I don't have the actual company name, I'll proceed with making educated guesses based on the words mentioned.

For the first tweet, ""xli industrials select sector spdr change URL..."" It might relate to the S&P 500, as SPDR is a stock quote for the S&P 500 ETF. So if xli is part of that sector, it could be Xly Industries or similar.

The second tweet has a sentiment of ""-1"", so it's probably negative. The third includes BABA (BAC), TSLA (TELLA, maybe), YGE (Youngstown Engineering), and others. These are financials, so if the target stock is one of these, perhaps a negative sentiment from this tweet would indicate a potential negative impact.

The fourth tweet discusses GMCR, which I believe is a financial services company. If there's a negative news about them, it could affect the stock price negatively. The fifth mentions BABA again but also talks about B2Gold (TAobao), though TAobao isn't a financial company unless they're part of a different sector.

I'm not entirely sure how all these tweets are connected without knowing the target stock. But based on negative sentiments in multiple tweets, especially BABA and GMCR, it might be a mixed sentiment overall, but leaning towards Negative because there's conflicting information or multiple factors that could impact the stock."
2015-06-03,Neutral,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to analyze the impact of some tweets on a company's stock price and determine whether it's positive, neutral, or negative. They provided two specific tweets to examine.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet: ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . e . p . s . URL $ baba $ swks $ hod.to $ euo baba stockmarket stock"". The stock symbol here is 'baba', so that's our target stock.

Now, I need to parse each tweet and extract positive or negative factors. Let me look at the first tweet: It mentions ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . e . p . s . URL $ baba $ swks $ hod.to $ euo baba stockmarket stock"". There doesn't seem to be any positive or negative content here, so it's likely neutral.

I should also check if there are multiple tweets provided. The user only gave one tweet, so I'll focus on that first one.

Since this is the only relevant tweet, and there's no additional information about factors or sentiment, I can't assess much beyond what's in this single tweet. It just looks like a stock ticker with various symbols but doesn't mention any positive or negative content impacting the stock.

Therefore, based solely on this tweet, I can't determine if it has a positive, negative, or neutral impact on the stock price because there's no context or information provided about how the user is holding the stock or any other factors affecting it."
2015-06-04,Negative,"Okay, so I have to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price for a given company. The user provided two tweets and wants me to determine if they'll impact positively, neutrally, or negatively on their future stock price.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . quotes URL $ baba $ fxe $ fxy $ aapl baba stocks share."" Hmm, this seems like some stock symbols and maybe an address. I'm not sure what's going on here. It mentions BABA and ALBB (BABA is Beta for Apple, ALBB could be Alpha bucking). The quotes are from different exchanges? Maybe the company is holding a company or something. Not sure if that tells me anything about the stock's performance yet.

Next tweet: ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . quotes URL $ baba $ fxe $ fxy $ aapl baba stocks share."" Wait, this looks identical to the first one. It seems like the same text is being repeated here. I don't see any new information or updates from the company here.

So, both tweets are the same content. They just repeat each other. Since there's no positive news or negative events mentioned about the stock or its performance, it doesn't look like this will affect the stock price positively or negatively. It might be a test tweet to check if I can recognize repetitive text quickly. So, probably, neither positive nor negative impact.

Therefore, my conclusion is that these tweets have no significant effect on the stock price."
2015-06-05,Missing,File not found
2015-06-06,Neutral,"Okay, I need to figure out how the given tweets affect the stock price of BABA and GOOG. Let me start by breaking down each tweet.

The first tweet is ""rt AT_USER why $ fb $ baba $ goog and $ msft would want $ twtr and would all benefit strategically . URL"". It's using Twitter handles in a way that implies enthusiasm for investing, especially related to companies like BABA and GOOG. The mention of strategic benefits suggests they see these stocks as desirable but not sure about their overall performance. This is positive because it indicates investors are optimistic about future growth.

The second tweet says ""3,500 % gains in 8 months & more stock picks on the way ! subscribe here to get them early : URL $ segi $ baba $ swet"". This seems to be promoting further gains and encouraging subscriptions for more picks. It's also using positive keywords like ""more"" and ""early"", which might indicate that the market sees potential for growth but not necessarily a guaranteed positive outcome.

Both tweets are encouraging investors to follow their accounts and look ahead, which can create buzz and anticipation in the stock market. They don't present any specific negative information or concerns, just vague promises of better positions or higher prices.

Combining these thoughts, I think both tweets contribute to building anticipation without indicating a clear positive outcome for the stocks. The lack of specific predictions about the direction of their price movements is what might be neutralizing the potential for a positive impact."
2015-06-07,Missing,File not found
2015-06-08,Negative,"Okay, so I need to determine the impact on the future stock price of the given company based on the tweets provided. Let's start by breaking down the process step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock from each tweet. It seems like the common stock symbols are BABA and MSFT. The user hasn't specified which one, but since they're both mentioned, I think it might be about their performance relative to each other or a broader market segment.

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate the factors into positive and negative. Let me go through each tweet one by one:

1. ""AT_USER $ baba your tweet has been featured on market parse , for iphone . URL"" – This seems like an unrelated tweet about internet services, so probably not affecting BABA or MSFT directly.

2. ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . bid size URL $ baba $ ibb $ vxx $ ibb baba nasdaq pennystocks"" – The words here are ""ibb,"" which stands for Investopedia, and ""vxx"" is the stock ticker for VIX (Volatility Index). Since this mentions VIX, it's likely related to market sentiment or volatility. However, VIX tends to go up when there's fear, so maybe a positive impact on VIX could be negative for some stocks.

3. ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . last trade URL $ baba $ jdst $ ief $ ual baba finance investing"" – This tweet includes ""finance"" and ""investing,"" which might relate to the company's financial news. If they're positive, it could be a good sign for MSFT. But if negative, maybe not.

4. ""rt rt rt rt rt $ msft 120 mints $ spy $ qqq $ aapl $ googl $ goog $ twtr $ fb $ baba $ pcln $ tsla $ bidu $ amzn $ msft $ ddd … … URL"" – This is a series of ""rt rt..."" repeated many times, which probably means the tweet isn't engaging with specific information. It doesn't mention any stock performance or positive/negative factors related to BABA or MSFT.

5. ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . summary URL $ baba $ giii $ pdl.to $ slv baba tradeideas share"" – Here, it mentions ""giiit"" which I'm not familiar with, but the mention of ""share"" might indicate a financial statement or news about trading. If positive, maybe it's good for BABA stock.

6. ""rt AT_USER this is alibaba's biggest push yet to take on amazon in the cloud : URL $ baba $ amzn URL"" – The user is comparing Alipay (BABA) with Amazon (AMZN), specifically focusing on the cloud segment. If there's a positive move, it could benefit MSFT as well.

7. ""f ford motor co . news URL $ f $ dba $ baba $ xon f stocks nasdaq"" – This mentions Ford Motor Co., which is related to the automotive industry. A positive news about F would likely be good for MSFT since automakers are part of the broader tech and consumer staple sectors.

8. ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . ask size URL $ baba $ edz $ boivf $ ssys baba stock stock"" – The user is asking for information, which doesn't indicate any positive or negative sentiment regarding BABA's performance.

Now, I'll assess each tweet's impact:

1. Unrelated to BABA/MSFT.
2. VIX related; likely a mix of factors affecting market volatility, possibly both positive and negative.
3. Finance-related, so maybe good for MSFT but could be mixed.
4. No specific info on stocks.
5. ""share"" indicates trading activity, which can affect stock price if there's news about performance.
6. Cloud segment move from Amazon; this is a strategic move that could improve visibility in the market, possibly positive for MSFT.
7. Ford-related news; favorable for MSFT as part of automotive or tech sectors.
8. No specific info on stocks.

Considering these, the main positive factors seem to come from points 6, 7, and potentially point 5 if it's about trading sentiment. However, point 2 involves VIX which tends to move in opposite directions, making it hard to say for sure. Point 3 is vague but could be positive or negative.

Overall, the strongest positive factors are the cloud move (point 6), Ford news (point 7), and the trading activity related to MSFT (points 5). The negative points are from point 2 with VIX and point 4 which doesn't mention stocks. So there's a mix of both strong and mixed sentiment.

Considering all these, I think the overall sentiment is mixed but leaning towards positive because several relevant factors are pointing in that direction."
2015-06-09,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their likely impact on the stock price of a company called BABA (baba). Let me go through each tweet step by step.

Starting with the first tweet: ""AT_USER $ baba alibaba's ma courts u . s . businesses , aims for $ 1t / year in gmv URL."" It mentions a revenue target, which is positive because it shows growth. That usually boosts investor confidence and can be seen as good news.

The second tweet isn't clear about the content. The user says ""diggingplatinum : rt ihnewsdesk : baba alibaba group holding ltd . company info URL $ baba $ erx … URL."" I don't have enough details to assess this one. It might relate to BABA's financials, but without more context, it's hard to tell.

Third tweet: ""tcn.to tricon capital group inc . p / e ratio URL $ tcn.to $ expe $ baba $ ppch tcn.to stockmarket nasdaq."" They mention the P/E ratio of TCN, which is a valuation metric. However, without knowing how this affects BABA directly, it's unclear if this is positive or negative.

Fourth tweet: ""rt AT_USER rt AT_USER : hpnn hop-on , inc . p / e ratio URL $ hpnn $ frifx $ baba $ sltd hpnn nasdaq pennysto …."" Again, similar to the previous ones, mentions another company's P/E ratio. Not enough info about BABA here.

Fifth tweet: ""lock lifelock , inc . change URL $ lock $ baba $ dxj $ lulu lock investing stockmarket."" This seems like a negative news event related to LIF (Lock) which could impact BABA if they're partners or competitors, but the overall sentiment is mixed without specifics.

Sixth tweet: ""$ baba's bounce at $ 86.12 is exactly where you'd like to see it . when resistance becomes support . spx."" It talks about a stock moving up and being in support area. This suggests that BABA might gain momentum, which can be positive but the overall sentiment isn't clear without more context.

Seventh tweet: ""rt AT_USER AT_USER $ baba floor of nyse URL."" Mentioning BABA's stock performance relative to NYSE floor could indicate recent price action affecting investor sentiment positively or negatively. It's a direct move in stock price, which can affect the market.

Eighth tweet: ""most active options : $ fb dropping satellite plan , $ baba us growth , mu downgrade , $ bac , $ aapl music AT_USER URL."" This seems to mention BABA being down (mu) and others doing well. It's volatile and could go either way, so it's hard to assess the overall sentiment.

Ninth tweet: ""$ aapl 127 @ 0.90 cents $ spy $ qqq $ aapl $ googl $ goog $ twtr $ fb $ baba $ pcln $ tsla $ bidu $ amzn $ msft $ ddd URL."" BABA's price is mentioned, which can influence the overall market or company performance. It could be positive if the stock gains, but it's also speculative.

Tenth tweet: ""AT_USER your tweet about $ baba had a sentiment of 5 and was featured on market parse . URL"" This seems like a general statement without specific information on BABA's financials or performance. It might be seen as neutral unless there's context linking the sentiment score to BABA's stock.

Eleventh tweet: ""$ ua $ baba serious hammer candles."" ""Serious hammer candles"" are bullish events where a company sees sustained positive earnings, which can boost confidence and likely increase BABA's stock price positively.

Twelfth tweet: ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . market cap URL $ baba $ t $ yoku $ cat baba investing share."" Mentioning the company's valuation could affect investor sentiment if it suggests a strong potential for growth or profitability, but without specifics, it's speculative.

Thirteenth tweet: ""alexmcena : alexmcena : alexmcena : ihnasdaqomx : vnq vanguard reit vipers prev close URL $ vnq $ russ $ baba $ qcom vnq fi …"" Multiple mentions of VVN and VIF. This could relate to sector trends or ETFs, which might have an impact on BABA's stock price but again, without context, it's hard to assess.

Fourteenth tweet: ""$ baba nice closing . but not to break 88 $ $ spy $ qqq $ aapl $ googl $ goog $ twtr $ fb $ baba $ pcln $ tsla $bidu $ amzn $ msft URL."" BABA is mentioned again near a target price of 88. If the stock reaches this price, it could be seen as good news.

Fifteenth tweet: ""alibaba group holding ltd partners with indian logistics solution provider - $ baba - URL URL"" This indicates a partnership which can sometimes lead to joint ventures or increased market share, potentially positive for BABA if they're part of a larger company. However, partnerships often depend on other factors like demand and profitability.

Now, summarizing the tweets: Some mention positive trends (like revenue targets, stock price movements), others are speculative or indicate negative news (like P/E ratios going up). There's a couple of tweets suggesting that BABA is about to reach a target price. The overall sentiment isn't clear because many tweets are either very vague or pointing to other companies. However, the presence of tweets like ""serious hammer candles"" and mentions of stock prices suggest possible positive impacts, but without context, it's speculative.

Given all this, I think the overall sentiment is neutral, as while there are some positive indicators, many tweets don't directly relate to BABA's performance or lack sufficient information. Speculative news and other company trends might balance things out, leading to aneutral conclusion."
2015-06-10,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of BABA. Let me break down each tweet and see what they're suggesting.

Starting with the first tweet: ""alibaba group holding ’ s ' buy ’ rating reaffirmed at hsbc $ baba URL."" It seems like a positive statement about their ratings, which might boost investor confidence. I'll note that as Positive.

Next, ""why this $ baba bull is lowering his price target : URL URL."" It mentions lowering the price target but uses a bull market context. While it's reducing expectations, it doesn't necessarily mean the stock is undervalued, so maybe a mix of factors here—Neutral might make sense.

The third tweet: ""jack ma says key to AT_USER success in u . s . and rest of globe is in small businesses $ baba URL with bonnie cao."" Positive about their success with small businesses. That's another positive point, so adding that on top of the previous Positive would keep it as Positive.

The fourth tweet: ""ungs us natural gas corp . prev close URL $ ungs $ apol $ axp $ baba $ ungs stockmarket."" It looks like a company news update. If they're saying something about energy prices or another sector, that could have an impact on their financials and stock price. Not sure yet.

The fifth tweet: ""tiger management top trades on q1 $ cdk $ xhr $ eqc $ mas $ fnf $ baba $ jd $ alny $ bx $ lng $ act $ gild URL."" Positive mentions of a company's performance in the first quarter. This could indicate that their stock is doing well, so another Positive.

The sixth tweet: ""top 5 business-to-consumer e-commerce platforms in china URL $ baba $ jd $ vips .. $ dang absent"" It seems like an update on market trends, maybe consumer spending. E-commerce platforms are often a driver of consumer spending, so this could be positive for BABA as they're likely expanding into more market segments.

The seventh tweet: ""rt AT_USER jdst direxion daily junior gold miners index bear 3x shares financials URL $ jdst $ xly $ baba $ avgo jdst …"" A negative outlook on the gold miners index but mentioning financials. Gold is a hedge, so if there's concern about its price, it could affect stock prices. But I'm not sure enough to say positive or neutral here.

The eighth tweet: ""so $ baba is selling at 18x revenue ( ! ) ... that's cute ."" It mentions a high valuation multiple for their earnings. This might suggest investors are expecting more growth or higher revenues, which could lead to buying up shares. This seems like it adds to the stock's value.

The ninth tweet: ""lulu lululemon athletica ask size URL $ lulu $ ppch $ baba $ hrb lulu pennystocks share"" They're talking about a brand, possibly in the athletic industry, but I'm not sure how this would directly impact BABA. Maybe indirectly if they have a product line that's a competitor.

The tenth tweet: ""AT_USER $ baba your tweet has been featured on market parse , for iphone . URL"" A link request indicating engagement with a company's tweets regarding their stock performance. This could imply positive attention, which might boost the stock price. So another Positive here.

The eleventh tweet: ""ge general electric co . last trade URL $ ge $ baba $ aapl $ idcc ge stockmarket share URL"" They're mentioning the stock market and EDP's stock. If GEC is a competitor or part of the same industry, this could affect BABA if there are cross- correlations in the business sector.

The twelfth tweet: ""rt AT_USER jack ma wishes alibaba never went public URL by AT_USER $ baba URL"" Positive about their future goals. If they're working on going public, investors might be encouraged to buy more shares, which is a good sign for BABA. So that's another Positive.

Now, compiling all these thoughts: Many tweets are positive in terms of ratings, outlooks, or brand mentions. The only negative-looking tweet was the seventh one about gold miners, but it didn't seem too strong. Overall, with more than half the tweets being positive and some neutral (the fifth one), I think the stock is likely to be positive."
2015-06-11,Negative,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of BABA. 

First, I need to identify which stock is mentioned in all the tweets. Looking through each tweet, I see that some of them mention $baba, so I'll focus on those. The first tweet says ""$ baba is the king of all frustrating stocks"", which suggests it's doing well but sometimes people feel the price goes up then down. 

Next, I need to break down each relevant tweet into positive and negative factors. For example, the second tweet mentions Aapl, $aapl, $fb, etc., so those are separate. Each of these could have their own factors affecting them. But since all tweets mention BABA, maybe they're related or part of a larger context.

Looking at each tweet:

1. The first tweet talks about how $baba is performing, going up then down. It mentions bulls being excited and market participants getting upset, which can sometimes lead to selling pressure on stocks.
2. The second tweet lists multiple options like Aapl, $fb, etc., so each of these could be affected by various factors.
3. The third tweet says the shot hits the bird that pokes its head out, which is a common meme or trend, implying some reaction from other markets.
4. This one updates financials for $xhb and mentions other companies like $ibm and $hjoe. These could be influenced by news about BABA's stock price changes.
5. Another tweet from Thursday about gold mining in NEV, which is unrelated to BABA.
6. The sixth tweet talks about cjtf shares in pennystocks, again unrelated.
7. The seventh tweet mentions HD and FDX, which are different stocks.
8. The eighth tweet says Aapl's $baba stock is declining after a price target cut. This sounds like a specific event that could impact BABA.
9. The ninth tweet mentions $baba being updated from 136 to 124 with a buy decision, suggesting a change in investor sentiment.

So, the main focus here seems to be on $baba's stock prices and related financial companies. 

Now, looking at sentiment:

- In the first tweet, BABA is up for a while before going back down.
- The ninth tweet says it was cut from 136 to 124, which could indicate that investors might have decided not to buy as much anymore, leading to selling pressure or concern about price levels.

Other factors like Aapl and Hjoe are mentioned, but since the main analysis is about BABA, I should focus on those. However, mentions of other companies don't necessarily add sentiment directly unless they relate.

The overall sentiment seems mixed because while BABA does go up then down (positive action), it also loses some value after a price cut. This could lead to selling pressure or concern for future prices. 

So combining these factors—some upward movement but also downward swings, and a significant price drop—the sentiment leans toward a negative impact on the stock."
2015-06-12,Neutral,"Alright, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me take it step by step.

First, I'll go through each tweet and extract the key information. Each tweet is about some stock or financial term. For example, ""Yahoo inc . could face $ 11 a share hit from adverse tax ruling"" mentions Yahoo with a positive quote but points to an upcoming tax issue.

I think the first thing is to identify the target stock. Looking at the tweets, I see some mention of stocks like YHOO, TASR, WUB, etc., but there's no direct symbol given. Maybe the user meant to refer to a specific company? Hmm, perhaps I should focus on each tweet individually and see if they relate to the same company or not.

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate into positive and negative factors. For example, in the first tweet, ""could face $ 11 a share hit from adverse tax ruling"" is both positive (hit) and maybe neutral? The URL mentions capstone, so it's related to Yahoo.

Wait, but without knowing which company each tweet is about, it's hard to assess the impact. If all tweets are unrelated or about different companies, I can't connect them. But looking at the list again, I see YHOO in multiple tweets (tweets 1-3,4,5,6). TASR and WUB as well.

Each tweet seems to be about a company's financial performance or policy issues affecting it. For example, tweet 2 talks about TASC and PENS stocks, while tweet 1 is about Yahoo with tax implications. I need to see if these relate to the same company.

If they don't all relate to the same company, how can I assess the overall impact? Maybe the user intended to ask about a specific stock but provided a list without context on which one to focus on. Without that info, it's impossible to determine the sentiment accurately. Alternatively, perhaps all tweets are about the same company but different aspects of their performance or policy changes.

Given this ambiguity, I might have made an incorrect assumption. If they're all about different companies, then each tweet needs individual analysis. However, since the user provided a list, and without context on which stock, it's tricky.

But wait, looking again at the tweets, some mention YHOO like tweet 1, 4,5,6. TASR in tweet 2, WUB in tweet3. So maybe they're all about YHOO? But then I need to see if each relates to YHOO's performance or policy.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is testing an analysis tool and has a list without context on which company it's referring to. In that case, each tweet would be treated separately, but that might not make sense because they're all about different stocks.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should proceed by assuming each tweet relates to a specific stock, perhaps YHOO since it appears in multiple tweets. Let me try that approach.

So, for YHOO:
1. Could face $11 share hit from tax ruling
4. Has lower P/E ratio (P/E = 275; I've read that high P/E can indicate overvalued stocks)
6. Other related companies like TASC

Other tweets relate to other sectors or different stocks but don't directly impact YHOO.

In that case, each tweet about YHOO would need evaluation. For instance, tweet1 mentions tax implications and a potential negative event (capstone), which could lead to a negative sentiment if investors expect worse outcomes. Tweet4 talks about the P/E ratio of YHOO being higher than expected, which might cause some fear but isn't extreme enough for a quick sell.

So overall, maybe it's neutral because while there's some fear from tax issues and stock performance, they're not enough to tip it significantly positive or negative.

Alternatively, if all tweets are about the same company, perhaps I need more context. But given the list, I think focusing on YHOO makes sense with multiple relevant tweets."
2015-06-13,Missing,File not found
2015-06-14,Positive,"Okay, so I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the future stock price of the company based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. The first tweet mentions ""ivv s & p 500 ishares day low URL $ ivv $ mxwl $ cvc $ baba ivv stockmarket investiwm russell 2000 ishares prev close …"", so I think the target stock here might be IVV. The second tweet refers to ""nflx $ baba"", which looks like it's about NFLX, possibly related to NFL football teams. The third tweet says ""alibaba group holding ltd . investor opinions URL $ baba"" suggesting a BABA stock. The fourth tweet mentions ""mbly baba"" and talks about trading ideas.

Next, I'll analyze each tweet for Positive and Negative factors. 

For the first tweet: It mentions IVV's day low, which is positive because lower prices often indicate growth potential. Also, it links to Russell 2000 index performance, which adds another layer of positive info. So, this tweet seems to have both positive factors.

The second tweet is about NFLX and BABA. NFLX might be a football team stock, so I'm not sure if that's positive or negative on its own. BABA could be a business stock, but without specific information about the company, it's hard to tell. However, since it doesn't mention anything negative right now, maybe it's neutral.

The third tweet talks about alibaba group holding and investor opinions. This suggests they're interested in trading or evaluating stocks, which might indicate positive sentiment if people are interested in BABA for trading purposes.

The fourth tweet is about NFLX again and mentions trading ideas. Similar to the second tweet, without more context on the stock itself, it's hard to assess definitively as positive or negative, just possibly neutral.

Putting this all together, the first tweet has strong positives, the others are somewhat mixed but maybe leaning towards a positive outlook. So overall, the sentiment is probably [Positive]."
2015-06-15,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of BABA. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at the list, it seems like BABA is consistently mentioned. The first tweet mentions ""(rt AT_USER alibaba aiming to become equivalent of hbo and netflix URL $ baba URL)"", so that's a clear mention of BABA.

Next, I need to analyze each tweet in terms of positive and negative factors. Let's go through them one by one:

1. **""rt AT_USER alibaba aiming to become the equivalent of hbo and netflix URL $ baba URL""**: This directly mentions BABA, so that's a strong positive factor.

2. **""large tech : growth chart ➡ URL $ avgo $ twtr $ ajd $ fb $ bd$ ... $""**: It talks about tech stocks with a focus on their growth trends. BABA is a tech-related stock, and the mention of growth might be positive.

3. **""stock in play : $ aapl $ fb $ twtr $ aal $ gpro $ baba $ dang $ mbly $ fold $ ll $ trak $ blue $ hqcl $ rdhl $ uvxy $ esi $ idra $ amba $ nem $ mu$"": Multiple large tech companies are mentioned, including BABA. This is good because it shows the company's position in the market.

4. **""abbv abbvie inc . p / e ratio URL $ abbv $ baba $ f $ date abbv stock investing""**: BABA is mentioned here along with ABBV. BABA is a dividend-paying stock, which might be seen as positive for investors.

5. **""rt AT_USER new video "" stocks & market outlook - 6/13 / 2015 "" URL $ aapl $ fb $ twtr $ baba $ nflx $ amzn $ googl $ tsla $ gpro""**: This tweet offers a news feed on the stock market, focusing on upcoming sectors like APPL, FB, NFLX, AMZN, etc. It's introducing new information about the market.

6. **""this $ baba news is pretty big longer term , might be the catalyst needed to get the stock moving higher""**: The sentiment here seems positive because it's suggesting that BABA could drive a bigger move in the future. This indicates a potential positive impact.

7. **""equities currently tagged highearnings by the closingbell community : $ aapl $ act $ baba $ biib $ ea URL""**: Again, mentions of BABA and other stocks. Positive because it's talking about earnings trends.

8. **""rt AT_USER $ baba $ nflx reuters : alibaba to launch netflix-like video streaming service in two months URL""**: This tweet links BABA to a new service they plan to launch. If they launch something similar, it could be positive for their market position and stock price.

9. **""baba alibaba group holding ltd . filings URL $ baba $ amgn $ eght $ bgnn baba investing stock""**: They've filed with the SEC, which is good news for BABA's stock price.

10. **""rt AT_USER yahoo may be next in line for ceo change URL $ baba $ yhoo""**: There's a suggestion that Yahoo might change their CEO role soon, which could affect their financial performance and hence BABA's stock price.

11. **""baba alibaba group holding ltd . current price URL $ baba $ spxl $ fnma $ ugaz baba investing finance""**: The stock is priced, which is a neutral factor because it doesn't directly impact the price but gives context.

12. **""rt AT_USER alibaba just announced a new netflix-like service URL $ baba""**: Another announcement about launching a similar service, reinforcing positive expectations for BABA's future performance.

13. **""baba alibaba group holding ltd . yield URL $ baba $ adt $ ego $ bona baba invest tradeideas""**: Positive because it suggests potential growth opportunities or increased interest from investors.

14. **""wow : $ baba bonked by four big brokerages . our AT_USER on alibaba URL""**: This tweet is a bit confusing. It says that four big brokerages have mentioned BABA, which could be positive news about their positions in the market. But I'm not entirely sure how impactful this is.

15. **""marissa mayer will determine her fate ! URL $ yhoo $ baba merger ipo money bigbusiness""**: This tweet seems to hint that there might be a merger or IPO planned, which could impact BABA's stock price negatively if it affects the company's financials or investor sentiment.

16. **""alphabeta to launch netflix-like video streaming service in two months URL $ nflx $ baba URL""**: Another announcement about BABA's new product. This is a strong positive factor because it directly relates to future earnings and stock price movements.

Now, looking at the overall impact:

- Positive factors include mentions of other tech companies, growth trends, potential future products, and earnings reports.
- Neutral factors are the filing with SEC and potentially some financial announcements.
- Negative factors might be if the market reacts negatively to these announcements or if there's significant news that could decrease BABA's stock.

However, given the positive mentions of new services, upcoming markets, earnings trends, and potential future moves, it seems like the overall sentiment is positive. The negative tweets seem less prominent compared to the positive ones."
2015-06-16,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided a list of tweets and specified a target stock symbol, but it's not listed here. Hmm, maybe I can infer which stock based on the tweets.

Looking at tweet 1: ""except for $ twtr $ baba $ amzn , most of stocks should be up or move sideways."" This seems to indicate that many stocks are expected to go up or stay stable. The words like 'up' and 'sideways' suggest a positive outlook.

Tweet 2 mentions ""$ url $ baba $ nflx"", but I don't know what these abbreviations stand for, so this tweet is unclear without context.

Tweet 3 says ""$ baba is rated buy, 24.2% upside by wall street analysts based on average ratings / targets."" This definitely shows a positive vote from analysts and mentions an upward movement, which is strong.

Tweet 4 has URLs like $ baba $ cybr $ mrtx $ dal $ baba investing stock. Again, not sure what these abbreviations mean here.

Tweet 5: ""$ adxs advaxis inc . chart URL $ adxs $ xoma $ baba $ aapl ... "". No context on the target stock is given from this tweet.

Tweet 6 just mentions that there was no reaction in $ baba to the news and still thinks long-term prospects are good. This suggests uncertainty, which might be neutral or negative.

Tweet 7 has several links with 'bank of america' and other companies, but again, without context on the target stock, it's hard to assess.

Tweet 8 repeats some links from tweet 7, so same issue as tweet 7.

Tweets 9-12 don't provide context either. It seems like a lot of tweets are about analysts or financial metrics without specific information about the target stock.

Considering tweet 3 mentions an upvote and expected upside percentage, it's strongly positive. However, other tweets lack context, making their impact ambiguous. But since tweet 3 is the most informative and shows clear upward movement from analysts, I think it gives the strongest indication of a positive trend."
2015-06-17,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided a list of eight tweets and an output requirement where I have to conclude with ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"". 

First, I'll start by identifying the target stock from each tweet. It looks like all the tweets mention ""baba"" in some form. Specifically, in tweet 1, it's under Armours; in tweet 2, Oracle Corporation; in tweet 3, VelocityShares; and others mention alibaba group.

Next, I need to extract Positive and Negative factors from each tweet. Let me go through them one by one:

1. ""ua under Armour , inc . bid size URL $ ua $ baba $ mnkd $ jnk ua stockmarket nasdaq"" – I see a lot of ""$ baba"", which is a strong word, so that's probably positive.
2. ""orcl oracle corp . last trade URL $ orcl $ mnk $ baba $ agn orcl stockmarket share"" – again, lots of ""$ baba"".
3. ""ugaz velocityshares 3x long natural gas etn p / e ratio URL $ ugaz $ sds $ baba $ dia ugaz stock finance"" – mentions ""$ baba"".
4. ""rt AT_USER alibaba invests in israeli venture firm $ baba $ kyth $ uvxy $ bidu baba investing nasdaq"" – has ""$ baba"".
5. ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . dividend URL $ baba $ kyth $ uvxy $ bidu baba investing nasdaq"" – has ""$ baba"".
6. ""rt AT_USER baba alibaba group holding ltd . change URL $ baba $ xpp $ rare $ eltp baba pennystocks trade ideas"" – again, ""$ baba"".
7. ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . filings URL $ baba $ fwdg $ jd $ amed baba share share"" – same pattern.
8. ""$ baba 86.50 86.30 86.07 1/3 a piece next weeks 88 calls onwatch take 2"" – this looks like a stock price update with numbers, which is positive.

Looking at the factors, all tweets mention or include ""$ baba"" in some way. This indicates strong positive sentiment. The target stocks mentioned are under Armours (positive), Oracle Corporation (neutral?), VelocityShares (maybe negative if they're financial services but I'm not sure) – wait, actually, velocity is a technology stock, so maybe it's more neutral.

However, the user didn't mention the target stock for all of these. They might be referring to different companies based on context. But without knowing which company ""baba"" refers to, it's hard to assess whether it's positive or negative. For example, if it was Oracle, a large tech company, that would be positive, but if it was a financial stock like VelocityShares, it could be mixed.

Given the information I have, all tweets are selling ""$ baba"". The stock prices and companies mentioned give some context: under Armours is a clothing brand (positive), Oracle is a tech giant (neutral maybe, depending on current market). So, without knowing which company ""baba"" stands for, it's tricky. But the price changes show positive info, suggesting potential gains.

I'm leaning towards [Neutral] because while there are some positive mentions of ""$ baba"", I don't have enough information about the actual companies. More context is needed to decide if it's definitely positive or neutral."
2015-06-18,Positive,"Alright, let me tackle this step by step. The user has given me ten tweets related to stock prices and asked me to determine their likely impact on a company's future stock price with a single tag: [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative].

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. It seems like BABA is recurring in these tweets, so that's my focus.

Looking at each tweet:

1. ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . yield URL $ baba $ xbi $ dis $ hgu.to baba nasdaq investing"" - This mentions BABA as a holding company with various investments. It doesn't specify the stock symbol but likely refers to BABA's stock.

2. ""psid positiveid corp . current price URL $ psid $ baba $ g.to $ _spy psid invest stockmarket"" - Again, BABA is here too.

3. ""rt AT_USER hedge funds build big positions in alibaba URL $ amzn $ baba"" - This ties into Alibaba and mentions hedge funds buying shares of BABA.

4. ""our penny stock pick on $ mjmj closed up 80 % today ! big news : URL $ segi $ baba $ swet"" - Clearly mentions BABA with a strong increase in value, which is positive for the stock price.

5. ""$ ebay $ baba : is it a good time to invest in ebay ? : "" - The user is asking about investing in eBay, not specifically mentioning BABA here.

6. ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . bid size URL $ baba $ nem $ hznp $ aem baba stockmarket nasdaq"" - Again, BABA is mentioned with other stocks like NEM and AEM.

7. ""our pick on $ ppch is now up 543 % for our subscribers ! big news : URL $ segi $ baba $ swet"" - Again, BABA's positive change in value.

8. ""rt AT_USER fslr first solar inc . stock message board URL $ fslr $ cop $ baba $ gmcr fslr investing nasdaq"" - BABA is mentioned in a different context but still relevant.

9. ""strong buy . buy , hold , or sell $ baba ? ? ? AT_USER"" - The user is asking about BABA, which might influence the stock price positively if they're saying to buy.

10. ""a few names i'm considering leaps on - $ twtr , $ cy , $ wday , $ yndx , $ baba , $ cree."" - Again, mentioning BABA but in a different context.

Now, compiling the factors and sentiment:

- The user is consistently asking about investing in companies related to BABA (e.g., Alibaba, eBay, Sunarac). This indicates they're interested in buying their stock.
- Statements 4,7,9 mention significant gains on BABA stocks.
- Statements 1,3,6,8 are directly referring to BABA's investments or performance without asking about investing.
- Statement 5 is a query about eBay.

The majority of the tweets suggest that the user is considering buying BABA. Statements like ""closed up 80%"" in statement 4 and others with positive changes indicate strong growth expectations. The user's questions are indicative of a buy intent.

Therefore, combining these factors—positive mentions, queries about investing, and general interest in BABA—it seems likely that the stock is poised for positive growth."
2015-06-19,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether these tweets are positive, negative, or neutral in their impact on stock prices for the company based on the given example. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, let's recall how to approach this. From the provided example, it seems that each tweet is analyzed separately, separating positive and negative factors, assessing sentiment from each factor, and then combining them to decide the overall impact. The user mentioned four tweets, so I'll process each one individually.

Looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER morgan stanley bets big on alibaba-backed insurer URL $ baba $ ms"". The user mentions Morgan Stanley investing in an alibaba-backed insurer, which seems like a positive signal for the company. That would likely boost their stock price.

Second tweet: ""vxx wells fargo & co . change URL $ vxx $ baa $ baba $ xlb vxx invest invest"". The mention of wells fargo and their changes indicates some investment activity. The word ""invest"" is used multiple times, suggesting that investors are interested in the company's performance or growth potential.

Third tweet: ""nwbo northwest biotherapeutics , inc . 52wk high URL $ nwbo $ fb $ cat $ baba $ nwbo finance investing"". Here, nwbo is mentioned with their financial status and investment activity. The phrase ""52wk high"" might be a typo or misinterpretation, but assuming it means significant growth, this could be a positive factor.

Fourth tweet: ""alibaba group holding ltd ( nyse : baba ) finance-business values $ 40 billion URL $ baba"". The company is listed on the NYSE with a market capitalization of $40 billion. This suggests that investors are optimistic about their size and growth potential, which could positively influence the stock price.

Fifth tweet: ""aal american airlines group inc . stock message board URL $ aal $ slv $ sedg $ baba aal investing tradeideas"". The mention of American Airlines is in the message but not directly linked to the company's investment. It's unclear whether this indicates positive or negative sentiment about the stock.

Sixth tweet: ""cde coeur d alene mines corp . last trade URL $ cde $ vustx $ baba $ mu cde trade ideas finance"". The mention of coeur d Alene and their stock trading could indicate investor interest, which might be seen as positive. However, it's not specific to the company in question.

Seventh tweet: ""nvo nxp semiconductor n . v . current price URL $ nvo $ ugaz $ baba $ slb nvo pennystocks pennystocks"". This looks like a typo with pennystocks repeated at the end. It might be that this is an investment offer or a stock listing, which could positively impact the company's stock.

Eighth tweet: ""AT_USER $ baba is now covered in the mg25 . a few great investors are holding . URL"". The user mentions covering the stock on mg25 and indicating some investors are interested. This suggests that there is interest from potential buyers, which can be positive.

Ninth tweet: ""AT_USER a lot of great investors take interest in $ baba on market guru URL"". Again, the mention of market gurus and investors taking interest indicates sentiment towards the stock being favorable, possibly positive.

After evaluating each tweet, most are pointing towards positive factors like investor coverage, investment activity, growth mentions, or high market capitalization. The only minor negative point is in the fifth tweet about American Airlines, but it's likely a typo and not indicative of sentiment. Overall, the trend seems to be positive."
2015-06-20,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to determine whether each tweet affects the stock price positively, neutrally, or negatively for Acme Technology Corp., based on the given tweets. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. **First Tweet**: ""acm aecom technology corp . bid URL $ acm $ admd $ baba $ lppi acm stock nasdaq""  
   The user is looking to buy (bid) the stock at ACME. This indicates a potential positive action, which could imply increased interest or momentum in the stock. So this tweet seems positive.

2. **Second Tweet**: ""diggingplatinum : rt danrocks 4 : admd advanced medical isotope corp . ask URL $ admd $ baba $ mas … URL""  
   The user is asking a question about something called ""danrocks."" Since it's a fictional entity and not related to Acme, I don't have enough context to assess the sentiment. This tweet seems neutral.

3. **Third Tweet**: ""equities currently oversold by the closingbell community : $ twtr $ aal $ baba $ bac $ kate … URL""  
   The term ""oversold"" suggests that the market is overvalued, meaning investors are selling to prevent further price increase. This could be negative news, so this tweet indicates a potential negative impact.

4. **Fourth Tweet**: ""rt AT_USER xlf industrials select sector spdr last trade URL $ xlf $ baba $ jdst $ hl xlf investing nasd … http …""  
   The user is selling shares of XLF (XEL) and investing in various sectors, including industrials and tech. Since there's an active buying intent from investors, this could indicate a positive trend. However, it might not be a huge shift yet.

5. **Fifth Tweet**: ""mnst monster beverage corp . 52wk low URL $ mnst $ nem $ baba $ slnn mnst investing nasdaq""  
   The user is selling (mnst) and indicating the company has 52 weeks of low performance. This could mean overselling or potential issues with the company's fundamentals, which might be negative.

Now, let me consider each tweet's overall impact on Acme:

- **First Tweet**: Positive buy.
- **Second Tweet**: Neutral about a fictional entity.
- **Third Tweet**: Negative due to oversoldness.
- **Fourth Tweet**: Positive from investors.
- **Fifth Tweet**: Negative because of low 52-week performance.

Considering the overall sentiment, some are positive (buying and investor interest), while others are negative. It's hard to say for sure without more context on Acme's recent performance or other factors. But based on the provided information, there's a mix."
2015-06-21,Positive,"Alright, I need to determine the likely impact on the stock price of the given company based on the provided tweets. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Hmm, looking at the first tweet: ""mjmj maryjane group , inc . message board posts URL $ mjmj $ eem $ gale $ baba mjmj finance pennystocks"". The company mentioned here is Pennystocks. 

Moving on to the second tweet: ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . market cap URL $ baba $ vdsi $ vbinx $ acor baba invest stockmarket"". This points out BABA as the target, which I've heard about before.

Third tweet: ""aa alcoa , inc . dividend URL $ aa $ baba $ _aks $ blta aa stocks investing"". Here, AA is mentioned with a dividend. 

Fourth tweet: ""rt AT_USER baba alibaba group holding ltd . dividend URL $ baba $ wmih $ slv $ bidu baba stockmarket nasdaq"". Another mention of BABA's dividend.

Fifth tweet: ""scss select comfort corp . summary URL $ scss $ btal $ baba $ aeo scss investing finance"". Includes a different company, Select Comfort, not related to the target stocks yet.

Sixth tweet: ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . tick URL $ baba $ vt $ z $ kbe baba invest finance"". Again, focusing on BABA.

Seventh tweet: ""xlf industrials select sector spdr shares URL $ xlf $ ahs $ baba $ aria xlf invest tradeideas"". Discussing an industrialist company, XLF.

Now, I need to analyze each relevant tweet. 

1. The first tweet doesn't mention any factors, just URLs and mentions BABA but not in the stock market context.
2. Second tweet talks about a market cap for BABA. This could indicate interest or activity related to the stock.
3. Third tweet discusses dividends from AA, which has historically had strong performance relative to its price.
4. Fourth tweet is similar, mentioning dividend growth for BABA.
5-7: These are unrelated companies, so they don't affect the target stocks.

Considering BABA's history, I know it has a strong positive track record with significant dividends and a solid financial foundation. The tweets related to BABA mention their stock market activities, which can influence investor sentiment positively. Therefore, the overall sentiment is likely positive."
2015-06-22,Neutral,"Alright, so I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on TBLA's stock price future. Let me start by breaking down what each tweet is saying.

Looking at the first tweet: ""rgwm $ baba is in trouble if it can't hold 85 tomorrow . no resistance until 83 . remember the chinese exchange is ... URL"". Hmm, that's a bit vague. It mentions holding 85 and referencing China's exchanges, but without specific details on what they're talking about. The term ""hold"" could mean different things depending on context. I don't have enough information to assess this tweet confidently.

The second tweet: ""rt AT_USER tsla tesla motors inc . change URL $ tsla $ ivv $ baba $ hyg tsla invest stock"". This looks like it's updating the prices for TSLA, IVV, BABA, and HYG. These are all ETFs or ETF-like instruments on the market. If a company is involved in these stocks, their price movements can be significant. But without knowing what these tweets are about—like why they're changing prices—it's hard to assess impact.

I'm not sure if I'm interpreting this correctly. Maybe the second tweet is more of an announcement or update related to something else. The first one seems less actionable unless there's a specific event mentioned, like a company issue or news that affects its performance.

Given the lack of concrete information from these tweets, it's challenging to determine their impact on TBLA. I might have to make a neutral assessment since I don't know enough about the underlying factors influencing TBLA."
2015-06-23,Missing,File not found
2015-06-24,Negative,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative for the stock price of a company. Let me start by breaking down what each step entails based on the provided information.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. That means looking for keywords like ""googl"", ""bib"", ""wfc"", etc., since those seem to be company names or symbols. From the tweets:

1. The first tweet mentions ""googl gopro , inc . company info URL $ googl $.avgo $ baba $ ll googl stock finance."" It seems to be about the company's finances and stock information, so maybe it's looking at financials.
2. The second tweet has ""bib proshares ultra nasdaq biotechnology news URL $ bib $.gs $ sqqq $ baba $ bib investing tradeideas."" This looks like a biotech news article with investing sections.
3. ""rt AT_USER avav avocet mining shares URL $ avav $ baba $ vti $ fit avav pennystocks stockmarket."" This one is about mining stocks, which are speculative or defensive.
4. The fourth tweet mentions ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . news URL $ baba $.wynn $ baba $.pll baba nasdaq pennystocks."" Here, there's a mention of Alibaba Group's news and penny stocks.
5. ""rt AT_USER alibaba's sale of u . s . online shopping site 11 main highlights the company's challenges."" This seems like a financial statement because it talks about the company selling something. It's also mentioning Alibaba's challenges, which might indicate negative sentiment if the stock is performing poorly due to the company's performance.
6. Lastly, ""wfc wells fargo & co . % change URL $ wfc $.baba $ cote $ mdcn wfc share stock."" This tweet mentions wells fargo and their stock performance percentage.

Now, I need to analyze each tweet step by step. For each, I'll separate positive and negative factors. Positive could be things like strong earnings, success of Alibaba's product, positive news about penny stocks. Negative might include challenges the company faces or poor investment sentiment.

1. The first tweet is about financials and stock info. It doesn't mention anything bad, just a company's details.
2. The second mentions biotech news but nothing overtly negative.
3. This one talks about mining, which is speculative. If it's going up, it might indicate positive news; down would be negative, but the context isn't clear without more info.
4. The tweet from Alibaba Group about penny stocks and their performance could affect the stock. Penny stocks are often seen as defensive, so if there's good news, it could be positive.
5. This tweet is about Alibaba's challenges. If they're facing problems or if their revenue is down, it might lead to negative sentiment because investors would lose confidence.
6. The wells fargo tweet mentions stock performance but doesn't provide specific information on the company itself.

Putting this together: The fifth tweet seems negative due to Alibaba's financial challenges. It could be affecting other companies in the same industry negatively. The first tweet is neutral about a company, just providing info. The second is neutral towards biotech news. The third is speculative; without context, it's hard to say if it's positive or negative. The fourth mentions penny stocks; since they can be seen as defensive, if Alibaba Group has good news about their stock performance, it could tip the balance positively for pennys.

So overall, considering all tweets, the main issues seem to be around Alibaba and its financials in the fifth tweet, which might lead to negative sentiment. The others are either neutral or speculative."
2015-06-25,Positive,"Okay, I need to figure out how the given tweets affect the stock price of a target company and determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Starting with alibaba’s new bank for ""little guys"" URL baba. That looks like the S&P 500 index (SPX). Next, gmcr $baba $drop $fxe is GMCR's stock on the NYSE at $baba. Smh $mmm $baba $baa.to smh would be SMH on the TAQ. Uri $uri $baba $tur is URU on the NYSE. Nothing doing with momentum trading, which might affect investor sentiment. Inside alibaba another URL baba again S&P 500. Wpc exchange WPC on TIA. Ebay's PayPal as a partner for alibaba or amazon.

Now, I'll analyze each tweet individually:

1. alibaba’s new bank: The stock is part of the S&P 500, so it's a significant component. Positive impact on the index, which likely benefits the company's performance.

2. gmcr investing posts a message with $gmcr $baba $drop $fxe. GMCR might be a rival or competitor to alibaba, but both are tech companies. It could either boost or hinder GMCR's stock depending on expectations about future performance.

3. smh and smm stocks: These seem like they could either increase or decrease based on their specific sectors or regions. I don't have enough info here.

4. uri trading ideas: This might indicate interest in the company, which can sometimes signal positive developments but also depend on other factors.

5. momentum trading discussions with several keywords: Momentum trading suggests investors are focused on this aspect of the stock, which could lead to more attention and possibly better price movement if they trade based on it.

6. inside alibaba's main URL baba again S&P 500, reinforcing positive sentiment.

7. wpc stocks: They might be rising due to market expansion or interest, so a positive outlook here.

8. ebay's PayPal is a partner for alibaba. If PayPal is a financial intermediary, it could support alibaba's business growth, which might have benefits for the stock.

Considering all these tweets, they seem to collectively indicate a positive sentiment around various aspects of the companies involved. The S&P 500 is up, other sector stocks may be undervalued or overvalued depending on their specific sectors. Momentum trading could lead to increased interest and trade volume, possibly improving prices. Overall, without more context, it's leaning towards a positive impact."
2015-06-26,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First tweet: ""amag amag pharmaceuticals , inc . ideas URL $ amag $ cree $ baba $ cfp.to amag share invest"". Hmm, this looks like some kind of URL manipulation. It seems like it's hiding the stock ticker. I think it might be related to a company called Amag or something similar, but without more context, it's hard to tell what that could mean. Maybe it's not relevant to the stock.

Second tweet: ""nflx netflix , inc . 52wk low URL $ nflx $ baba $ gevo $ gild nflx pennystocks stockmarket"". Again, there are URLs here with symbols like ""nflx"" and ""baba"", which I recognize as company names. It seems like it's a website or blog post listing NFLX (Netflix) shares and other investments. The mention of ""52wk low"" makes me think about a low stock price for the past 52 weeks, possibly due to earnings reports or other factors. If there are warnings about upcoming earnings, that could indicate a negative impact on the stock price.

Since the first tweet is not related to the company and the second one points towards some investment-related news with warnings about future earnings, I'm leaning towards a Negative sentiment overall."
2015-06-27,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given tweets are positive, neutral, or negative for the stock price impact. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbols in the tweets: baba and pennystocks. These could be companies that the user is monitoring, but without knowing their actual stock names or the context of these specific words, I might have to make some assumptions.

Starting with the first tweet: ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . dividend URL $ baba $ slw $ chk $ tqqq baba pennystocks stockmarket"". The tweet mentions ""baba"", which is a popular stock symbol. It also lists various stocks like slw, chk, and tqqq, along with some URLs related to those companies. I'm not sure what the dividends are about here, but since it's mentioning several companies, maybe it's indicating a broad range of holdings or transactions.

The second tweet is: ""hds hd supply holdings , inc . financials URL $ hds $ baba $ payx $ feye hds finance stocks"". This one also lists multiple companies with different symbols and mentions ""financials"" as the field. It seems to focus on a specific company called HDS or something similar.

Now, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. In the first tweet, there's no explicit mention of good news or bad news. It just lists holdings and URLs, so maybe it's neutral in that aspect. For the second tweet, ""financials"" is mentioned, which might suggest potential risks because financials could be a sector that does well or poorly.

Next step is to assess sentiment. The first tweet doesn't directly indicate positive or negative action, but since it lists multiple companies and mentions dividends, it might indicate a diversified portfolio. However, without knowing if these are gains or losses, it's hard to say for sure. 

The second tweet specifically points out ""financials"", which can be volatile. If financials perform well, the sentiment could be positive; otherwise, negative.

Considering both tweets together, they list multiple companies but mention a specific sector in one. This suggests that there might be some active interest or activity in those sectors, which is often a sign of cautious optimism. However, financial performance can take any form, so it's uncertain if this impacts the stock price positively or negatively.

Putting it all together, without more context on what these stocks actually do, it's challenging to determine the exact impact. But given that they focus on ""financials"" and list multiple companies, it might hint at some activity in a sector that can influence the overall market. However, I'm leaning towards a neutral stance because without explicit information about positive or negative news from these entities alone, it's hard to conclude definitively."
2015-06-28,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how these tweets affect BABA's stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, each tweet is an independent factor. Starting with the first one: ""interactive chart -> URL $ baba revenue is growing . URL"". This seems like a positive sign because it mentions that BABA has good revenue growth and provides links to URLs which are related to stock information. That's a strong indicator of positive sentiment.

Next, tweet number 2: ""googl google inc . - class a ask URL $ googl $ wmih $ baba $ ziop googl share share"". This is looking like a promotion for Google shares and mentions BABA as something to consider in their strategy. Since it's about Google's performance, which could positively influence BABA if they are related companies or strategies that BABA could benefit from.

The third tweet: ""$ appf appfolio inc URL $ tna $ vdsi $ mu $ gbgm tna $ trip $ yy $ v $ tsla trip $ ua $ baba $ abx $ fdx ua $ tsla $ jnj $ fdx $ s"". This looks like an offer to buy shares from TSLA (Tesla), which is a major tech company. If there are positive signals about Tesla's performance, it might boost BABA if they are in the same industry or have overlapping growth potential.

Lastly, tweet 4: ""$ appf appfolio inc URL $ iyr $ baba $ amba $ bcrx iyr nasdaq investing $ ief $ midd $ ewy $ tasr ief $ gld $ tsla $ swks $ di"". Similar to the third tweet, this is about purchasing shares from TSLA again. Positive news about Tesla could positively impact BABA if they are in the tech sector or have a strategic relationship.

Putting it all together: The first tweet is strong positive for BABA's revenue. The second tweet is promoting Google, which might provide some benefit but not sure how specific to BABA. The third and fourth tweets offer shares from Tesla, another major company, suggesting positive sentiment about Tesla. These signals, while spread out, indicate that there are positive aspects related to various sectors affecting BABA.

I think the overall impact is mixed because one tweet is very specific (Tesla) which might be a strong factor but others are more general or not directly tied. However, given how stock markets react when multiple positives come in, especially from companies in tech and similar industries, it's likely the overall sentiment is positive."
2015-06-29,Negative,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how the given tweets affect the stock price of a company. The user has provided four tweets and wants me to determine if they are positive, neutral, or negative about their impact on the stock.

First, let me look at each tweet individually to see what they're saying. 

1. ""erx direxion daily energy bear 3x shares dividend URL $ erx $ baba $ xly $ m erx invest finance"" – This seems like a mix of company names and mentions of the stock symbols. It doesn't specify if it's positive or negative, so I might not get much from this one.

2. ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . volume URL $ baba $ admd $ bidu $ csun baba pennystocks stocksbarc . l barclays ex-div …"" – Again, multiple stock symbols and mentions of trading volumes. No clear sentiment here either; it's just a bunch of information.

3. ""rt AT_USER options news : $ bac , $ fb , $ baba . earnings activity : $ apol , $ payx , $ apol . AT_USER w / AT_USER scott : $ vix URL"" – This tweet mentions the earnings of BABA and others, including a mention of VIX. The ""earnings activity"" section is interesting because it's looking ahead to future performance. Positive words like ""earnings activity"" suggest that investors might be optimistic about future results.

4. ""rt AT_USER notable opening imbalances : $ bac -1.1 m , $ c - 184k , $ baba - 234k , $ twtr - 222k , $ ge - 147k , $ f - 108k , $ v - 52k , $ hd - 48k , $ t - …"" – This one talks about significant negative movements in multiple stocks, specifically BABA and others. It's a clear indication that these stocks are underperforming relative to the market.

Now, considering all four tweets together: the third tweet is positive because it's talking about earnings, which can boost stock prices, especially if management is optimistic. The fourth tweet is negative because it's showing declining trends in several companies, which usually affects investor confidence and could lead to downward moves.

So putting it all together, there are two positive factors and some negative ones. But the overall impact seems more on the negative side due to the significant declines mentioned."
2015-06-30,Positive,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets about the given stocks and determine their impact on their future stock prices. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I see that each tweet is about a different company: shop shopify, alibaba group chairman jack ma, dxj wisdom tree, and centene corp. My task is to figure out if each one positively, neutrally, or negatively affects their stock price based on the provided tweets.

Starting with the first tweet: ""shop shopify , inc . current price URL $ shop $ xlf $ ew $ baba shop nasdaq investing."" This seems like a generic message asking about the current prices and not providing any specific information. Since it's just informational, it doesn't directly relate to stock performance. So, I think this tweet is neutral because it's more of an announcement than anything that affects investment sentiment.

Moving on to the second tweet: ""rt AT_USER alibaba group chairman jack ma , alibaba's grand ambitions in us and china ( video ) URL $ baba alibaba."" This one mentions Jack Ma, who was a significant figure in Alibaba. He seems like a positive person, especially in the tech sector. His influence is often seen as a catalyst for growth. Also, the mention of video shows he's been involved in more initiatives, which could be positive. However, I don't see any negative indicators here; it's just about his actions and possibly some stock movements. So this seems like a strong positive factor.

Third tweet: ""dxj wisdom tree japan hedged equity ex-div date URL $ dxj $ pzoo $ bidu $ baba dxj finance share."" This one is about hedge funds or financial shares in Japan, specifically from dxj wisdom tree. Hedge funds can be risky because of potential losses, but the mention of hedging suggests that they might have been involved in risk management or asset management. However, without specific data on performance or any positive indicators related to the stock price, it's hard to say if this is a strong positive or negative factor. It could be neutral.

Fourth tweet: ""cnc centene corp . ask URL $ cnc $ baba $ baba $ mbly cnc nasdaq stockmarket."" This seems like another generic announcement about a company asking something. No specific information about the stock's performance, so I think this is just another informational tweet without any positive or negative cues.

Putting it all together: The second tweet has a strong, positive tone due to Jack Ma and his involvement in Alibaba, which can boost the tech sector. However, the other tweets are either generic, unrelated, or speculative with limited information. So overall, the impact seems mostly positive from the positive tweet."
2015-07-01,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company and then classify them as positive, neutral, or negative. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually.

First tweet: ""nicohof 1 : ihnasdaqomx : dmrc digimarc corp . short sales URL $ dmrc $ fxb $ intc $ baba dmrc fin … URL"". This one seems to be providing links but doesn't provide any specific information or context. It mentions some stock symbols and URLs, which are likely pointing to different stocks, but without details on how they affect the price, it's hard to assess sentiment.

Second tweet: ""stocks in play miércoles 01 de julio $ aapl $ fb $ twtr $ aal $ gpro $ baba $ fit $ mu $ xiv $ uvxy $ juno $ sgnl $ cisg $ alrm $ tvix $ mbi $ bioc $ fcau $ cb"". This tweet seems to be indicating that stocks are in the ""playing"" phase of some sort, possibly implying a lack of confidence or uncertainty. The mention of multiple companies involved might suggest investors are cautious and perhaps disheartened, which would lean towards negative sentiment.

Third tweet: ""dnrg dow chemical co . day low URL $ dnrg $ drrx $ abirlanuvo.in $ baba dnrg stocks pennystocks"". Here, it's mentioning stock prices of specific companies. The fact that the price of dnrg is at a low and mentions its stock holdings with pennystocks could indicate potential for buy interest or a change in investor views. However, without context on how this affects the overall market or company performance, it's challenging to pin down the sentiment.

Fourth tweet: ""rt AT_USER actives on open @ cboe : $ aapl $ amd $ twtr $ bac $ jpm $ fb $ baba"". This one is about Twitter user activity at the CBOE (Chicago Board Options Exchange) and specific stock prices. The mention of AT_USER active could suggest more investor interest or followability, which might be seen as positive by some. However, it's also possible that this relates to trading decisions without concrete data on the company's performance.

Fifth tweet: "" tsla tesla motors inc . current price URL $ tsla $ baba $ wmih $ rdsh tsla pennystocks stocks"". Similar to previous ones, this is listing stock names and their prices. The mention of TSLA (Tesla) being at a higher price compared to other companies could indicate increased demand or interest, which might be seen as positive but without specifics on the company's health.

Considering all these tweets, some mention specific stocks with prices or links, others talk about stock holdings and sentiment indicators like price levels. Combining these gives mixed signals—some suggest uncertainty or low confidence (negative), while others show increased activity or interest in specific sectors (positive). Without a clear dominant view from one of the trends, it's hard to assign a single sentiment category. However, perhaps leaning towards negative due to the lack of direct info on company performance."
2015-07-02,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for a company. The user has provided two tweets, so I'll go through each step carefully.

First, the goal is to extract the stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at tweet 1: ""$ suti has now seen 400 % gains in the past 2 weeks ! special update : URL $ segi $ baba $ swet"". Hmm, it doesn't seem to mention a specific stock here. Maybe ""suti"" refers to a company, but without more context, it's hard to identify. I might skip this tweet for now since the stock symbol isn't clear.

Next, tweet 2: ""rt AT_USER baba alibaba group holding ltd . last trade URL $ baba $ vxx $ mmm $ hlf baba tradeideas nasdaq"". This seems relevant because it mentions ""baba"", which is a well-known ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) for the S&P 500. That gives me some context—maybe it's related to S&P 500 stocks.

Now, focusing on tweet 2: It talks about ""baba"" holding ltd., which I think refers to a company or entity. The term ""last trade URL $ baba ..."" suggests that the tweet is updating the last exchange-traded fund's URL for baba. This could mean something like they're providing real-time information about their holdings in various ETFs.

So, combining both tweets, it seems like tweet 1 might be a promotional or announcement tweet related to a stock, and tweet 2 provides direct information about a specific ETF (baba) that the user is holding. The main action here is a mention of gains for baba and updates on their holdings in other ETFs.

The user's instructions say I need to identify the stock symbol from each tweet. For tweet 1, since it mentions ""baba,"" which is an ETF, but not a specific stock unless they're referring to a company named SUTI or something else. But without more information, I can't get the exact stock. So maybe this tweet is just a general announcement about gains, and I should note that.

For tweet 2, ""baba"" is clear—it's the ETF symbol. It mentions ""last trade URL $ baba ... nasdaq,"" which indicates that this ETF has a price compared to NASDAQ.

Now, assessing sentiment: The first tweet talks about 400% gains in the past two weeks for something unspecified—maybe a rise in stock prices or performance of another ETF? If it's just a general announcement without more context, I can't be certain if it's positive or negative. It could be neutral since it's speculative and doesn't provide specific information.

However, tweet 2 is very direct about the holdings in baba, an ETF that presumably tracks the S&P 500. If there are gains mentioned in this tweet, it might signal confidence in the sector or company, which can positively affect stock prices. Additionally, mentioning NASDAQ could indicate a broader market movement.

Putting it together: The first tweet is speculative without specific info on impact, and tweet 2 provides direct information about baba's holdings and past performance. Both suggest potential positive sentiment for the stock or ETFs mentioned."
2015-07-03,Negative,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact on the stock price for these tweets about the company. Let me break down what I need to do step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at each tweet, they all mention ""baba"" and ""gm"", which are often stock ticker symbols. So it's likely that baba is the company we're analyzing here.

Next, for each tweet, I have to separate them into Positive (P) and Negative (N) factors. Then evaluate how each tweet influences investor sentiment. 

Let me go through each tweet one by one.

**Tweet 1:**
- It mentions various stock symbols like i wish you guys an ... $ mdin $ slnn $ cote $ fb $ gbsn $ aryc $ aapl $ twtr $ spy $ goog $ mjmj $ mdcn $ auri $ baba $ f gm nflx URL. It seems to list some stocks and links, which might indicate support or positive information.
- The content is informational, so not sure if it's positive or negative yet.

**Tweet 2:**
- Talks about covs covisint corp., bid URL, mck, ma, baba, stocks investing. This tweet seems to mention multiple companies and invest in them. It might be selling shares (卖出) as a strategy.
- The use of words like ""covs,"" ""mck,"" etc., could indicate support but the actual action is selling.

**Tweet 3:**
- Involves leahanneta, glen . l, bxo.to, baba, xle, glen . l share finance realizes ... URL. It mentions a blog or article and sells shares.
- The language here includes ""realizes"" which might suggest selling. The mention of ""baba"" as a stock makes me think this is selling.

Now, assessing sentiment for each tweet:

1. **Tweet 1**: It lists stocks but doesn't specify positive or negative intent. The links might be relevant to the company, suggesting some positive info. But since it's just informational and not explicit, it's hard to say definitively.
2. **Tweet 2**: Clearly mentions selling shares, which is a strong negative action from the seller. The use of ""invest"" might imply they're against buying.
3. **Tweet 3**: Also sells shares, similar to tweet 2. It suggests that selling more shares will help in the stock's price.

Considering all tweets, two are selling positions and one is just informational. Each tweet shows a clear intent to sell. So overall sentiment seems negative because multiple sellers are selling shares."
2015-07-04,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on BABA's stock price. Let me take it step by step.

First, looking at each tweet individually to identify positive and negative factors. Then, evaluate how each tweet affects investor sentiment. After that, combine all the information to determine if the overall effect is positive, neutral, or negative for BABA.

Starting with the first tweet: ""baba bank of america corp . e . p . s . url $ baba $ cvx $ jnj $ cde baba stocks financebac bce , inc . bid size …"". Hmm, it mentions ""finance"" and ""pennystocks,"" which I think are related to BABA. It looks like BABA is highlighted as a financial company. The sentiment seems positive since they're discussing their stock.

Second tweet: ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . stock message board url $ baba $ ntap $ cnxt $ ea baba pennystocks share"". This one also mentions finance and pennystocks, similar to the first. It's a financial statement or analysis suggesting BABA is in shape. Positive sentiment again.

Third tweet: ""iff intl flavors & fragrances day low url $ iff $ gdxj $ rmbs $ baba iff share finance"". They mention something about flavors, which could be related to their products. But I don't see immediate signs of positive or negative. It seems a bit vague and not strongly opinionated.

Fourth tweet: ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . day high url $ baba $ morl $ rio $ vltc baba finance pennystocks"". Again, mentioning BABA in financial statements about their stock performance. High performance is positive.

Fifth tweet: ""rt AT_USER five minute trades - $ aapl $ fb $ googl $ goog $ gpro $ ibb $ lnkd $ qqq $ spy $ twtr $ v $ tsla $ nflx $ baba $ amzn - url"". This one mentions other technology stocks but ends with BABA (AmZN) and includes ""fifth minute trades."" Not much else, just a trade mention. The mention of their stock makes it seem like they're performing well.

Sixth tweet: ""grh greenhunter energy , inc . ideas url $ grh $ derm $ ief $ baba grh pennystocks share"". This tweet is more focused on greenhunter energy's ideas, but also mentions BABA. Positive sentiment about their stock.

Now, combining all these tweets, the majority of them are positive about BABA either in financial statements or trade mentions. The third tweet has some vague terms but doesn't contradict earlier sentiments. So overall, it seems like a positive trend."
2015-07-05,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. The user has given four tweets and asked for an analysis of their likely effect on future stock prices, with options [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative].

First, I need to understand each tweet individually. Starting with the first one: ""rt audrealford : twitter stock buzz : $ eurusd $ baba $ spy $ fb $ hum ( 02:30 pm ) stocks finance stockmarket stockpic … URL"". This seems like a buzz about various stocks, including BABA, which is a company I know. The user mentions $ baba and other ETFs or indices, so this tweet is likely related to financial markets. With the market often being positive these days, especially around earnings reports and events, but given that it's 02:30 pm, maybe it's a late morning event? Not sure if this is positive or negative yet.

The second tweet: ""rt AT_USER baba alibaba group holding ltd . 52wk high URL $ baba $ xiu.to $ aig $ vltc baba trade ideas investing"". This mentions BABA and XLIU, which are ETFs. The user says it's a 52-week high. High could indicate strong momentum or earnings, so this might be positive. It also talks about BABA being in group holdings, but unless there's info on performance, it's hard to say.

Third tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ btu peabody energy corp URL $ amgn $ baba $ fv $ tvix stocks $ adro $ feye $ phm . v $ dxj nasdaq share $ b …"". This is about PEYU from Peabody Energy and BABA. It mentions the NYSE volume (dvda), which can indicate investor sentiment—volume is usually a sign of confidence or lack thereof. If it's high, maybe positive; if low, negative. BABA is an ETF, so its performance could be tied to the market.

Fourth tweet: ""vxx ipath s & p 500 vix short-term futures etn chart URL $ vxx $ xiv $ baba $ baba vxx nasdaq pennystocks"". VXX is another ETF. The user mentions the S&P 500 and short-term futures, which could be an indicator of overall market trends or sector performance.

Now, compiling this: The tweets are about various stocks and indices related to BABA, Peabody Energy, and the S&P 500. The time frame is around midday, so it might not yet reflect current events like earnings or economic indicators. High volume in some ETFs suggests strong demand, which could be positive. But without specific details on each company's performance, it's challenging to gauge a clear trend.

Considering all the factors—each tweet touches on BABA and related companies, with some mentioning other sectors like energy and financial indices. The volume is high for some ETFs, which might indicate increased investor interest or confidence. However, since these are multiple tweets from different angles without specific context, it's hard to synthesize a clear overall sentiment.

I'm leaning towards [Neutral] because while the markets have been generally positive in recent weeks, this information doesn't provide strong enough indicators for a definitive conclusion. It could be a mix of positive and negative factors depending on individual company performance."
2015-07-06,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price of BABA. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually.

The first tweet is ""$ baba double bottom to the penny."" Hmm, ""double bottom"" sounds like a technical term in stock charts. From what I remember, a double bottom happens when a stock reaches two different low points before rising again. So if it's a double bottom, that usually indicates some form of support or expectation for a price reversal. When things look poised on their way up, investors might feel bullish because they’re seeing signs that the trend is likely to change.

So putting this together: The user mentions a ""double bottom,"" which suggests the stock is about to rebound. That would mean positive news, so I’d lean towards a Positive sentiment here."
2015-07-07,Neutral,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to analyze tweets about a stock and determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative in impact on the stock price. They've provided four tweets with details like company names, quotes, URLs, and other factors.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""gc kinross gold corp . quotes URL $ kgc $ mjmj $ baba $ gg kgc invest investing"". Hmm, the word 'kinross' seems significant here. The next tweet is similar with 'barrowick'. Then the third has 'baba alibaba group holding ltd.' and the fourth mentions 'siri', but I'm not sure if that's relevant yet.

Once I have each stock symbol, I'll check their stock ticker symbols on a marketplaces like Yahoo Finance. The second tweet refers to ABX, which is an ETF. Third is BABA, known as Alibaba. Fourth mentions SIRI, which might be part of a Twitter account or a company name.

Now, for the analysis part. For each tweet, I need to identify positive and negative factors. Let's go through them one by one.

1. The first tweet has quotes from Kinross, Mjmj, BABA, and GGC investing. These are all financial companies or ETFs related to gold or energy. They don't mention any positive aspects like good news or earnings, so I think this is neutral.
2. The second tweet talks about ABX, which is an ETF for energy stocks, trading on various exchanges. No specific market outlook here; it's more of a financial statement update.
3. Third tweet mentions BABA (Alibaba), a tech company with major investments. This seems positive because Alibaba is in the tech sector and has strong growth potential.
4. Fourth tweet discusses SIRI, but I'm not sure about its relevance without context. It could be part of a positive story or unrelated.

Now, assessing sentiment for each tweet: For tweets 1-3, they don't indicate any favorable sentiment, so I'll mark them as [Neutral]. The fourth tweet mentions SIRI and no specific info on stock performance, so also [Neutral].

Overall, the impact seems neutral because none of the tweets show positive or negative indicators that would affect investor confidence. They're just providing financial data without predicting future stock changes.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Do any of these tweets suggest news about the company? The first tweet has quotes and a list of companies, which doesn't indicate specific info on a particular stock. Similarly, the third tweet is about BABA, which is a large company, so positive sentiment makes sense there.

I should probably separate each tweet into their components: stock symbol, other factors, then assess their impact. So in this case, only one tweet (BABA) would have a positive factor. The rest are neutral because they're not discussing specific stocks or providing positive outlooks.

So overall, the sentiment is [Neutral] since none of the tweets provide strong enough information to tip the balance towards positive or negative."
2015-07-08,Missing,File not found
2015-07-09,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided some tweets related to a stock symbol and wants an analysis of their impact on future stock prices. They want the conclusion in terms of [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative].

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet, it mentions ""baba URL,"" which seems like the stock code for BABA, a company involved in agricultural science. The next few tweets mention things like ""claytrader : * * $ baba video chart 07-09- 15 * * URL,"" and others with ""baba"" in them.

Now, breaking down each tweet:

1. The first tweet is just a placeholder, so I can't get the stock symbol from this one.
2. ""appf appfolio inc URL $ fb $ googl $ lnkd $ twtr $ aapl $ sne $ msft $ ko $ sina $ amzn $ baba ko p … URL"" seems to be multiple URLs but doesn't provide any immediate information about BABA.
3. The tweet mentions ""claytrader : * * $ baba video chart 07-09- 15 * * URL,"" which probably talks about some stock charts, maybe related to BABA on July 9th.
4. The fourth tweet says ""alibaba jumps on china rebound ; stocks surge as oil spikes URL $ baba."" This is more positive because Alibaba did well due to China's economic recovery and rising oil prices.
5. The fifth tweet is an announcement: ""rt thestreet : $ baba news ---> alibaba exec taken into custody !"" This seems negative because it mentions taking an employee, which could be bad news for confidence.
6. The sixth tweet asks if BABA stock is nearing another bottom, which is speculative and ambiguous.

Putting this together, most of the tweets are positive except the third and fifth ones. However, the fourth tweet adds more context from Alibaba's performance. So overall, some positive factors but there's a negative note in the fifth tweet."
2015-07-10,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to figure out their impact on the stock price of BABA. Let's go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock, which is BABA. Now, for each tweet, I should separate them into positive and negative factors. I remember that ""factor"" here refers to things like news about the company or industry trends affecting their performance.

Starting with the first tweet: ""itb ishares dow jones u . s . home construction financials URL $ itb $ iwm $ baba $ ulta itb stock invest."" It mentions Dow Jones, home construction, and financials. The term ""home construction"" might be a factor because it's related to real estate, which can impact the real estate sector. I'll mark this as positive.

Second tweet: ""happy friday ! $ baba $ aapl $ nflx stocks looking promising among the pre-market greenery . $ lc stock 2q loans # expected today ( my opinion )."" This seems encouraging, mentioning stocks like APle x and NFLX which are tech companies. A positive market outlook ahead of earnings is usually good for investors. I'll note this as positive.

Third tweet: ""rt AT_USER former tencent employees detained in bribery probe URL $ tcehy $ baba $ tctzd."" The mention of former Tencent employees is a potential negative because they were involved in a bribery matter, which could harm BABA if there's evidence against them. So this will be marked as negative.

Fourth tweet: ""$ xlb percent change updated thursday , july 9 , 2015 7:06 : 56 pm $ smn $ baba $ amgn $ pvsp URL."" The date is pretty far back, but the stock price update on the 9th might indicate a recent event affecting BABA. Without specific info, it's hard to assess, so I'll note this as neutral.

Fifth tweet: ""hou.to horizons betapro nymex crude oil bull plus etf dividend URL $ hou.to $ fslr $ baba $ panw hou.to stockmarket …"" The mention of crude oil and dividends suggests a positive outlook on energy and income, which is generally good for companies. So this will be positive.

Sixth tweet: ""i am bullish on $ baba with a target price of $ 84.16 on vetr ! URL."" This clearly states a strong bullish opinion with a specific target price. A direct statement from the user about their outlook is very indicative of positive sentiment. Positive here makes sense.

Seventh tweet: ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . quotes URL $ baba $ scmp $ aapl $ uup baba stocks stockmarket."" The company BABA's ownership and quotes indicate they are doing well in the stock market. This is another positive indicator, so I'll mark it as positive.

Eighth tweet: ""bib proshares ultra nasdaq biotechnology tick URL $ bib $ ugaz $ baba $ cmg bib pennystocks invest."" Proshares' update on Biotechnology could affect BABA if there are trends or news in that sector. Without specifics, but given the stock ticker, it might be an indicator of positive developments. So positive.

Ninth tweet: ""$ baba shorts happy again , it's shorts dog . "" The phrase about shorts and being a dog is a bit playful and less likely to impact the stock directly. It's more about investor behavior than actual performance. So neutral here.

Tenth tweet: ""rt AT_USER alibaba vp reportedly under investigation $ baba URL."" This clearly states that Alpha Therapeutics (the VP of BABA) is under investigation, which is a serious news affecting their reputation and stock price. This will be marked as negative.

After evaluating each tweet, I see a mix of positive and negative factors. The main positive tweets are the second, fourth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth. But then the negative ones are first, third, fifth, ninth, and tenth. Without specific trends or indicators in between, it's tricky to determine a clear overall sentiment.

However, BABA is mentioned multiple times with positive statements, especially in the fourth tweet which gives a target price. The other negatives might balance out the positives slightly. But I think the majority of the information points towards a bullish tone."
2015-07-11,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price. I'm not too familiar with financial analysis, but I'll take it step by step.

First, each tweet is about a company: xiu.to shares, glf, tpac, and dbo powershares. I need to extract the stock symbol from each. For example, the first tweet mentions ""goog $ baba"", so the stock is Gold issued BABA. The second is GLF (General Linear Corporation), third is TPAC, fourth is DBO. Wait, but for a company like DBO, it's better to check their official symbols because sometimes they might switch symbols around.

Next, I need to break down each tweet into factors. Positive factors are things that boost the stock, like good news or positive trends. Negative factors are bad news, like earnings reports, earnings calls, or any negative information. Then, I have to assess how these factors influence investor sentiment, whether it's up, neutral, or down.

Looking at the first tweet: ""xiu.to ishares cdn s & p / tsx 60 index fund day high URL $ xiu.to $ goog $ baba $ fsrbx xiu.to tradeideas stock."" This mentions a cdn s&p index fund and FB (Google Finance), so the factors are positive. The sentiment here is probably positive because it's sharing good investments.

Second tweet: ""glf gulfmark offshore , inc . ask URL $ glf $ jnug $ baba $ invn glf finance share."" This mentions GLF, a financial services company, and shares in BABA (Bengsay Bank). The factors here are positive because it's a share offer. Sentiment is positive.

Third tweet: ""tpac trans-pacific aerospace co . inc . day high URL $ tpac $ jdst $ iwm $ baba tpac invest share."" TPA, aerospace company, so the factor is positive. Also shares in BABA are mentioned, which reinforces a positive outlook.

Fourth tweet: ""dbo powershares db multi-sector commodity trust oil fund current price URL $ dbo $ fb $ baba $ mgm dbo finance …"" DBO's factors include power shares and oil-based trusts, both of which are positive. Shares in BABA are mentioned again.

So each tweet is pointing towards a positive outlook for the stock. The fact that they're all sharing investments from good companies like Google, GLF, TPA, and DBO makes it seem like the market thinks these companies will perform well. Investors might be buying more of these stocks or hearing about opportunities, which would increase sentiment positively."
2015-07-12,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to determine the impact on the stock price of baba. I'm given several tweets and need to analyze them step by step.

First, I'll look for the target stock symbol in the tweets. Scanning through each tweet, I see ""baba"" mentioned in a couple of them. The first tweet has multiple $ symbols before ""baba,"" which likely refers to a stock ticker. So, my target is baba.

Next, I need to break down each tweet's factors and sentiment. Let me go one by one.

1. The first tweet starts with ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . ideas URL $. It seems like the user is adding some unrelated info. Not much can be extracted from this one.
   
2. The second tweet mentions a lot about $ baba and talks about being happy to hear thoughts. It's using $ baba in context, so that's clear it's referring to baba. The word ""be happy"" suggests positive sentiment.

3. The third tweet is ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . tick URL $. Again, similar to the first one, just more info. No major factors here.

4. The fourth tweet talks about ""epam epam systems , inc . % change URL $ epam $ twtr $ celg $ baba epam stockmarket share."" Here, it mentions a company named epam and their performance relative to baba. If the market is up for epam, it might influence investor sentiment towards baba.

5. The fifth tweet mentions ""polgarstocks : yinn direxion daily china bull 3x shares ex-div date URL $ yinn $ baba $ axll $ av … URL."" It seems like polgar stocks are performing well, especially as the title says ""bull"" with a 3x return. The mention of a share price increase and ex-div date might suggest positive news about baba's stock.

6. The sixth tweet refers to ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . eod data URL $. Again, not much extraction here, just more info.

Now, I'll assess the sentiment for each relevant tweet:

- **Tweet 2**: Positive because it expresses happiness and seems focused on baba.
- **Tweet 4**: If epam is up, but without knowing their actual stock performance relative to baba, it's ambiguous. Maybe neutral if no significant info or positive.
- **Tweet 5**: Strongly positive due to the bull market from polgar stocks.

Since tweet 2 is clearly positive and tweet 5 supports that sentiment with good news about epam, which could positively impact baba. However, tweet 4 introduces another company but doesn't provide enough information about their performance relative to baba.

Overall, the strongest indicators are tweets 2 and 5. They directly mention baba's stock or related companies' performance. Therefore, the overall sentiment is positive."
2015-07-13,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on a company's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the stock symbols mentioned in each tweet because they seem to be the target stocks. 

Looking at tweet 1: It mentions ""shopify inc"", which seems like it could be a tech company related to products or software. Then there are a bunch of other URL strings with dollar signs and abbreviations. Hmm, that might not be a standard stock symbol I recognize, so maybe it's an alternative identifier or something else entirely.

Next tweet 2 starts with ""today most active option $ aapl"" – wait, Aapl is the ticker symbol for Apple Inc., but there are other symbols like ""fb"", which is Facebook. The rest of the text seems like it could be listing other options and companies, possibly related to options trading. Again, without knowing the exact stock, it's a bit confusing.

The third tweet is ""$ baba"" – Baba is an acronym I've heard before in financial contexts, often referring to BlackRock, which is a large investment company. So that seems like another potential target stock.

Now, each tweet needs to be broken down into positive and negative factors. For each tweet, I'll separate the words related to the stock symbols from other elements. 

For tweet 1: The word ""shopify inc"" might be part of an industry or a company, but without knowing the exact product, it's hard to assess the impact on the stock. The other parts seem like just URLs with dummy data and numbers.

Tweet 2 is more about options trading, which involves investor sentiment towards the stock. If people are actively looking for options, that could imply positive sentiment because they might be seeking opportunities or want to trade. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if this is a bullish or bearish signal.

Tweet 3 is directly pointing at Baba, the BlackRock symbol. As of my knowledge cutoff in July 2023, I don't have information on their stock performance, but historically, companies can fluctuate. Since the word ""baba"" could be an acronym for a specific company or sector, it's hard to assess without more data.

Putting this together, tweet 1 is about a tech product, which isn't directly linked to the stock. Tweet 2 is a trading platform that might affect sentiment but not necessarily the stock price. Tweet 3 is pointing at a different entity entirely. 

Given that, none of these tweets provide concrete information about the target stocks. They either discuss unrelated products or options trading platforms, which aren't typically the direct indicators of a company's performance on the market.

Therefore, it's difficult to determine whether any of these tweets have a positive, neutral, or negative impact on their respective stock prices without more context or specific data points."
2015-07-14,Negative,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and figure out how they'll impact the stock price for a given company. Let's see, the user provided three tweets, and each seems to mention someone moving large amounts of money or something related to their holdings. 

First, looking at tweet 1: It mentions ""baba"" which I know is a mutual fund investment vehicle. The tweet says George Soros' holdings in BABA returned -2.2% in Q2. That's a decrease, so that seems like bad news for him. Maybe it affects other investors or the company as well.

Tweet 2 is about Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., and they're under fire due to Jack Ma's financial troubles. I remember Jack Ma was involved in something big, maybe an investment. If his company is on the brink of collapse, that could hurt their stock price too.

Tweet 3 lists a bunch of stocks: TWTR, BABA, Aapl, FB, Twtr, Nflx, Googl, TSLA, Amzn, Pcln, Prmtx, Fold, Scmp, Fv, etc. It seems like they're all investments or something related to financials. Maybe the sentiment here is positive because people are focusing on these stocks.

But wait, tweet 1 specifically mentions BABA's performance and maybe also links to ""tradeideas,"" which could be a broader market effect. However, tweet 3 lists other stocks that might represent different sectors or companies within the tech or investment space.

I think the main factors here are the decreases in portfolio holdings and possibly some stock movements. But since tweet 2 is more about a company's financial health, it might have a stronger negative impact than just the portfolio performance. The overall trend seems to be that investors are worried, especially with BABA down and maybe other stocks being affected.

So putting it together, I'm leaning towards a negative impact because both mentions of decreased holdings and possibly some market concerns could cause investors to sell their stock or cut spending. But then again, the broader list in tweet 3 might suggest some positive sentiment about tech companies or investment vehicles.

I think the final conclusion is a mix of factors but leans toward a neutral or slightly negative overall effect because of the specific portfolio performance and some broader market reactions."
2015-07-15,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of BABA (Baba) company and determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . short sales URL $ baba $ jnj $ tsla $ tna baba stock stockmarket"". It seems like this is a website listing BABA's shares and some other companies with their stock symbols. I don't see any positive or negative information here, just the current price changes. So maybe it doesn't have much impact.

Next tweet: ""brk / b berkshire Hathaway , inc . prev close URL $ brk / b $ vwesx $ algn $ baba brk / b invest invest"". This one mentions a Berkshire Hathaway, which is a big company in the tech sector. The words ""prev close"" and some symbols suggest it's about stock trading activity or maybe market data. But nothing directly related to BABA itself.

Third tweet: ""fuertes bajas en el sector tech chino $ yoku -7,08 % $ qihu -5,14 % $ bidu -2,73 % $ baba -1,4 % $ sina -6,54 %"". This looks like a chart or market analysis showing the performance of BABA against other sectors in China. The numbers indicate negative percentages for BABA and others, which could suggest that BABA is underperforming compared to those companies. That might influence investor sentiment negatively.

Fourth tweet: ""$ twtr twitter inc URL $ mtls $ xly $ baba $ cbyl mtls pennystocks $ mck $ any $ caf $ agq mck $ pg $ amgn $ prkr $ bns.to"". This seems like the stock price changes for TWTR, XLY, BABA, etc. The ""mtls"" and ""pennystocks"" in the URL could be a typo or error, so I'm not sure what that means. Maybe it's just general market news.

Fifth tweet: ""swks skyworks solutions inc . short sales URL $ swks $ sso $ baba $ dia swks stocks investing"". Similar to the first tweet, this is about a company listing its shares and some financial metrics. No direct info on BABA.

Sixth tweet: ""alibaba from a new angle : big data crm URL $ baba"". This suggests that BABA has switched their focus or approach entirely, mentioning big data. That could indicate a shift in strategy which might be positive for the company, but it's vague and not giving specific numbers.

Seventh tweet: ""$ twtr twitter inc URL $ baba $ aapl $ fb $ twtr $ nflx $ googl $ tsla $ amzn $ pcln 4thofjuly wheat $ vrx.to $ vltc $ rgbp ylena"". This is another list of stock symbols, including Apple and Amazon. The mentions of tech companies might indicate that the market is focusing on those sectors, which could have some effect but isn't specific to BABA.

Eighth tweet: ""$ gyst up 10.71 % with ask moving up ! check this one out : URL $ segi $ baba $ swet"". The word ""gyst"" might be a typo for ""gap,"" and it says BABA has gone up by 10.71%. It also mentions the ask moving up, which could indicate better pricing or favorable news about the company's shares.

Now, putting this all together. The first tweet doesn't give any info on BABA. The third tweet shows a market analysis for BABA against other tech companies in China, suggesting that it's not performing as expected there. The eighth tweet gives some positive news about BABA increasing by 10.71%, which could boost its stock price. But I'm not sure how much weight that has on the overall sentiment because it's just a small piece of the puzzle.

Other tweets are either about other companies or market data without specific info on BABA. So, the positive tweet might have some short-term effect, but the overall impact is unclear. The third tweet suggests uncertainty but also mentions specific negative numbers for BABA compared to others in that sector, which could lead people to worry. However, if it's a short-term analysis, maybe not enough data.

Considering all these factors, while there are some positive points about BABA increasing by 10%, the other tweets indicate uncertainty or market conditions affecting investor sentiment negatively. So, despite the slight improvement, the overall sentiment might be negative because of the broader market concerns."
2015-07-16,Neutral,"Alright, I'm looking at these tweets and trying to figure out how they affect the stock price of BABA. Let's go through each tweet step by step.

The first tweet mentions a double bottom on daily trading. That could mean the stock is stable or has some signs of being bought back. But I don't have much info, so I'm not sure yet.

The second tweet talks about a Twitter sale via AT_USER. I know Twitter has had issues with stock buybacks recently, but it's speculative how that would affect BABA. Not enough details to say for sure.

Looking at the third tweet, it mentions an airline group raising expectations of a future sale. That sounds like good news because if they sell their shares, they'll reduce their debt and potentially free up cash, which could be invested elsewhere. But again, I'm not certain about BABA's current situation.

The fourth tweet is from RT on Twitter, listing various stocks including BABA. No specific info here; it just shows the company's stock in multiple platforms. Not much to analyze yet.

Fifth tweet also lists stocks, including BABA. Same as above—no specifics or trends, just presence of BABA in the list.

Sixth tweet talks about stocks in play on Friday July 16, 2015. It mentions APL, FB, TWTR, etc., but without any predictions or future movements, I don't think this affects current stock performance positively.

Seventh tweet mentions ex-divide date for HYG. Ex-div should mean the company is about to pay a dividend, which might give investors hope in the market but doesn't directly impact stock price unless they're looking for dividends.

Eighth tweet says it's a black sheep story. Black sheep companies are those that don't fit into the company model of other large-cap firms. However, if BABA has had issues with them before, this could affect their fundamentals and potentially trade higher or lower based on their history.

Ninth tweet is about FOUT, but the text isn't clear enough for me to determine its impact on BABA's stock. It might be a niche topic unrelated to BABA.

Tenth tweet discusses buying more shares with significant assets and restructuring. This could indicate positive sentiment as investors might feel more confident in the stock or see it undervalued. The mention of restructured finances shows confidence, which is a good sign for a positive outlook on BABA.

Putting this all together: Some tweets talk about BABA's performance, others are speculative but not giving clear trends, and one tweet does show positive actions from investors regarding their shares. However, there's also uncertainty around stock buybacks or dividend changes. With mixed signals of investor sentiment and some speculative info, it seems like the overall impact isn't heavily positive."
2015-07-17,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets about a company's stock price impact on their future price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, each tweet is supposed to be for a specific stock symbol. The user provided all the necessary information, so I can start processing each one individually.

1. **rt AT_USER orb trades - $ iwm $ spy $ qqq $ dia $ baba $ aapl $ fb $ twtr $ nflx $ googl $ tsla $ amzn $ bidu $ pcln $ lnkd - URL**
   - The user mentionsorb trading and several stocks, including spy (Spy), baba (BA), twtr (TWTR), etc. Spy is known for tracking the S&P 500, so this is likely a positive sign of potential future gains.

2. **our penny stock picks have gained 3,600 % in 9 months ! subscribe to get our future picks : URL $ segi $ baba $ swet**
   - This tweet expresses confidence and encourages subscribers to follow for future picks. The use of percentages and a call to action (subscribe) suggests positive sentiment related to the company.

3. **open position : $ z $ lulu $ baba stocks to watch : URL**
   - Similar to the second tweet, it's encouraging to stay in the company by watching their stock positions. Positive outlook on future picks.

4. **$ baba - yahoo files registration statement for spinoff of alibaba shares URL**
   - The user mentions a registration statement related to a Yahoo spin-off of Alibaba. If this is positive news, it could indicate the potential growth or value from the acquisition. However, without knowing the specifics, it's speculative but likely positive.

5. **$ mu micron technology inc URL cl_f sheskindahot 1dradioparty yellen worldemojiday $ aapl $ bac $ fb $ spy $ ge $ baba $ g**
   - This tweet is confusing with unrelated words like sheskindahot, party, andemojiday. It's possible the user made a typo or intended different terms. The keywords include mu micron technology inc (MUTI), which relates to tech but isn't directly about the stock in question.

6. **$ mu micron technology inc URL $ aapl $ fb $ baba $ nflx $ msft $ intc $ spy $ fit $ xle $ pbr $ ugaz $ hig $ len $ agn $ bcr $ bmy $ ua**
   - Similar to tweet 5, it's using words like NFLX (now rename to TSLA) and unrelated terms. It seems there might be a mix-up in the names or keywords.

7. **$ mu micron technology inc URL toptickertweets $ aapl $ fb $ dax $ tsla $ gld $ baba $ twtr $ hum $ … URL**
   - Again, using unrelated hashtags and words like top tickertweets. It seems this is another mix-up with different companies or terms.

8. **rt AT_USER $ baba $ 80s held . needs to clear $ 82.21+ to get a higher high off a higher low & to confirm a new leg .**
   - This tweet is encouraging but unclear about the specific stock being referred to. The mention of an 80s ""held"" and future goals makes it a bit vague, which could be seen as uncertain or speculative.

9. **$ mu micron technology inc URL $ aapl $ bac $ fb $ spy $ ge $ baba $ nflx $ c $ fe $ tsla $ f $ t $ uwti $ rad $ gild $ vxx $ ua fx es_f**
   - Another mix of unrelated hashtags and company names, possibly typos. It's unclear what the tweet is about, making it hard to assess sentiment.

After reviewing all nine tweets, most focus on general tech movements (MUTI) or unrelated companies. The only clear positive statements are tweet 1 and tweet 2, which give confidence in future stock positions. The mixed usage of unrelated terms likely doesn't provide actionable information but could imply uncertainty from the user's side.

Given that the company mentioned in tweet 1 is S&P 500 ETF (SPY), a positive note about potential growth might be expected. However, without concrete details or specific indicators, it's challenging to gauge overall sentiment definitively."
2015-07-18,Negative,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze the impact of these tweets on a company's stock price. The user provided four tweets, and I need to determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative for the stock's future price.

First, looking at each tweet individually might be tricky because they don't specify which stock is being referred to. That makes it hard to tell what exactly these tweets are about. For example, the first tweet mentions $ twtr twitter inc URL, but without knowing which stock this refers to, I can't assess its impact accurately. Same with other tweets.

The user also mentioned that I should identify the target stock from each tweet, so maybe I can infer it. But since each tweet has multiple symbols like $ mtls, pennystocks, twtr, etc., it's clear it's referring to different stocks. This lack of context makes me unsure which stock is being discussed here.

Without knowing what specific stock each tweet is about, assessing the sentiment seems impossible. Investors might be discussing things unrelated to a particular company's performance or changes in trends that could affect their valuation. Without more information on the subject matter of each tweet, I can't determine if these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative for any given stock.

Therefore, it's best to conclude that without identifying the specific stock being referred to by each tweet, I cannot accurately assess the impact on its future stock price."
2015-07-19,Negative,"Okay, let's analyze these tweets to determine their impact on Tw Tracker stock.

The first tweet mentions ""camaleon 2040"" and other stocks related to Apple, Tesla, and others, all in a URL format. These are likely about future tech trends or product launches, which could be positive if they're expected good news for the company. However, without specific information on whether these companies are undervalued or if there's a particular trend mentioned, it's hard to assess definitively.

The second tweet talks about China's guidelines on internet finance and mentions several stocks. While internet finance can have various impacts depending on context, this seems like a minor event and might not directly affect the stock price much unless the guidelines are positive for the company.

The third tweet lists more financials and tech companies, similar to the first one. Again, without specifics on how these companies perform or any upcoming events, it's ambiguous whether they're expected to positively influence the stock.

The fourth tweet discusses microtechnology innovations by Muon and mentions expectations related to the 2016 election. This could be seen as speculative because it ties current political events to future tech developments, but it doesn't directly provide information about the stock performance.

Overall, each tweet refers to various sectors, some of which might have positive outlooks if they align with expected trends or if there's a signaling effect from other factors. However, without specific data on how these companies perform or any upcoming events that could positively or negatively impact their valuation, it's challenging to determine a clear overall sentiment."
2015-07-20,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of BABA (BAC). I'm not super familiar with all the stocks mentioned here, but I'll take it step by step.

First, the user has given 10 tweets, each comparing BABA to another company or a technology-related company. My task is to analyze these and decide if they're positive, neutral, or negative for BAC's stock price.

I know that sentiment analysis involves looking at factors like the tweet's content (positive or negative), investor reactions, and whether those factors lead to an increase or decrease in stock prices. So, I need to extract key points from each tweet.

Looking at the first tweet: ""$ mu micron technology inc URL $ baba $ aapl $ fb $ twtr $ nflx $ googl $ tsla $ amzn $ pcln $ prmtx $ fold $ scmp $ fv prmtx espys"". It mentions BABA compared to Mu Micron and TSLA. The word ""espys"" suggests it's related, maybe an ETF or a financial instrument that could affect stock prices.

The second tweet talks about ups, United Parcel Service (UPS) and investing. UPS is a carrier company, so if they're up, that might indicate positive sentiment as investors are seeing growth. But I'm not sure how this directly affects BAC.

Third tweet: ""aal american airlines group inc . yield $ aal $ xop $ aal $ baba aal stockmarket pennystocks"". AAL is a financial services company; a positive yield could imply good earnings or investment prospects, possibly affecting BAC's stock. However, the mention of pennystocks doesn't ring a bell.

Fourth tweet: ""smh market vectors semiconductor yield $ smh $ ung $ baba uco smh stock stock"". SMH is another tech company, and if their yield is positive, it might be seen as good investment. But I'm not sure how this ties into BAC's performance.

Fifth tweet mentions W weighed stocks (WWS), which could be related to energy or other industries. The mention of GILSA or other ETFs doesn't directly connect to BAC, but if they're undervalued, that might suggest a positive outlook.

Sixth and seventh tweets are about baba alibaba group's stock performance. The wording here suggests they're doing well, so maybe the stock is performing well, which would be positive for BAC if their market presence is strong.

Eighth tweet: ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . last trade URL $ baba $ baba $ esrx $ onty baba stocks sharebac bank of america …"". ESRX and OBNYI are financial indices; if they're strong, it might be seen as a sign of good economic conditions or growth in the broader market, which could positively affect BAC.

Ninth tweet: ""twtr twitter inc URL $ spy $ qqq $ dia $ iwm $ aapl $ tsla $ gpro $ gld $ uso $ nflx $ googl $ goog $ gdx $ dust $ jdst $ xlf $ baba"". This is a mix of tech stocks and ETFs. If Google or other tech giants are doing well, that's a positive sign for BAC.

Tenth tweet: ""$ mu micron technology inc URL $ aapl $ bac $ fb $ spy $ ge $ baba $ nflx $ c $ fe $ tsla $ f $ t $ uwti $ rad $ gild $ vxx $ ua fx holx"". Similar to the first tweet, involving multiple tech companies. If these companies are underperforming, it might be negative for BAC.

Now, I need to consider the overall impact. The presence of UPS (second tweet) and baba alibaba group's positive performance could lead investors to buy more shares, affecting BAC positively. However, other tweets mention tech stocks like Google (gld), Facebook (fb), Tesla (tsla), and Amazon (amzn). If these are undervalued or showing strong growth, it could contribute to a positive sentiment for BAC.

Other factors: TwTR's ETFs might indicate investor interest in related assets, which could drive prices. The mention of Google being up might mean that investors expect good earnings, which would be positive news for the tech sector and potentially BAC if they have a significant market presence.

But I'm also noticing some tweets with less clarity or unclear mentions, like ""espys"" and others not directly connected to BAC. If these are misdirected or irrelevant, it could lead to confusion in investor sentiment.

Considering all this, the positive factors seem like UPS, alibaba group performance, Google-related ETFs, and tech stocks. The negative factors don't seem present here. So overall, I think the positive tweets contribute more than negative ones, making BAC's stock likely positively impacted."
2015-07-21,Positive,"Alright, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of BABA. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet mentions scaling up logistics costs but talks about bidding or offering. It's speculative and might not significantly affect the stock directly.
2. The second tweet from Yahoo reports a loss but rising revenue, which is typical for any company. This could indicate mixed sentiment due to non-recurring losses.
3. BABA shares some news in China related to their group holdings, suggesting they're diversifying or investing elsewhere. That's generally positive and might boost the stock.
4. Lexi G's lithium exploration report is a bit technical but shows a potential investment opportunity. This could be seen as a strategic move for the company.
5. BABA focusing on EOD data for earnings might indicate their team is monitoring developments, which could affect investor confidence.
6. GeQ staying strong over 416% suggests investor interest in penny stocks. It's a positive indicator of strong sentiment.
7. Ashr's X-Trackers report and China fund summary are relevant to BABA's investments. These signals from other companies might support their stock price.
8. The yield from BABA's investment is mentioned, showing they have potential future growth through this project.
9. While focusing on Aapl, the tweet suggests looking into YHOO for more details. This could indicate an interest in a company that has similar business models, potentially good for the stock.

Considering all these factors: positive trends from X-Trackers and China, mixed from Yahoo's revenue report, some focus from BABA, and potential gains from their investments. There are signs of optimism, especially with positive news about BABA's activities. The overall sentiment seems to be positive."
2015-07-22,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the company based on their given symbols and the content.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking through the tweets, some mention ""baba"", others say ""alibaba"". I'm assuming that ""baba"" is the main stock we're interested in because it's more commonly known as a tech stock related to Alibaba Group, which seems like a big company.

Now, for each tweet, I should separate positive and negative factors. Let me go through them one by one:

1. alibaba strikes partnership with unilever: This looks positive because it shows collaboration, which can boost the stock.
2. silver trust summary: Positive as they are investing in gold.
3. upbeat stocks from alibaba group holding: Clear upward trend, good for investors.
4. multiple company names like yhoo, aapl, etc., indicating strong earnings or strategic partnerships.
5. AT_USER mentions a spinoff and shares price target: This is encouraging because a spin-off can lead to better returns.
6. Multiple targets from baba: Consistent updates showing confidence in the stock's value.

Looking at the factors:
- Positive tweets are 1,3,4,9,10. That's five positive points.
- Negative tweets: None. All others are positive or supportive.

Since there are more positive factors than negative ones and all positive statements are constructive, the overall sentiment is definitely positive."
2015-07-23,Negative,"Okay, I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of Apple Inc. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet mentions $ twtr and others with URLs pointing to companies like AP, BA, FB, etc., suggesting positive news about general financial companies.
2. The second tweet talks about gold prices and investing opinions, which could indicate a mix of positives from stock sentiment and negative from gold, but overall it might not be decisive yet.
3. Third tweet mentions BAA bank's fundamentals improving, which is usually good for investors as it shows management is looking better. This seems positive.
4. Fourth tweet discusses BAA and EEM, both of which are Apple's ETFs. The stock might be in a strong position with these ETFs being defensive.
5. Fifth tweet is about GS, SACHS GROUP, and their stocks, suggesting strong earnings reports would drive prices up.
6. Sixth tweet mentions CTIX and XE TO, which could be related to energy or other sectors. It's mixed but maybe a bit positive for growth companies.
7. Seventh tweet talks about BAA again, mentioning fundamentals moving forward. This seems consistent with the fourth tweet, so overall positive.
8. Eighth tweet lists HPQ, FB, BAA, and others as top sweepers. These are all big tech companies, which is good news for Apple's stock.
9. Ninth tweet is critical of logistics, saying only BAA can deliver in China or 217 countries, but doesn't mention anything negative related to Apple. It might be about the economy or market conditions affecting delivery, not necessarily Apple's performance.
10. Tenth tweet discusses PBR and petroleto (Petrobras) stock, which is a tech company. While this could be positive for petroleto but doesn't directly relate to Apple.

Looking at all these tweets, they mostly seem to focus on positive aspects of general companies or specific sectors like energy or technology. There are no negative mentions, and most are focused on improving fundamentals or delivering in certain regions, which is generally considered positive for investors. The focus on ETFs and tech stocks suggests strong performance across multiple areas.

So overall, the sentiment seems positive as everything points towards good news from various angles related to general companies and specific sectors."
2015-07-24,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze each tweet and determine their impact on the stock price of BABA (Baba Group). Let's go through each point step by step.

1. **First Tweet:** ""$ baba filled gap & struggling with it"" - This seems positive because it mentions a gap being filled, which could imply good news for investors.
2. **Second Tweet:** ""$ baba"" - Without context, this is neutral as no specific info is given.
3. **Third Tweet:** ""rt AT_USER baba alibaba group holding ltd . ask size URL $ baba $ sfm $ googl $ snss baba stockmarket tradeideas"" - This adds more information about BABA's performance from a different source, which could be positive or neutral since it's speculative.
4. **Fourth Tweet:** ""icymi : china ’ s jd , com launches u . s . mall - technode URL $ jd $ baba $ jmei $ dang $ vips"" - The mention of tech companies being launched might indicate growth, so this is positive.
5. **Fifth Tweet:** ""baba bank of america corp . exchange URL $ baba $ swks $ twtr $ xom baba stockmarket stocks"" - BABA and BOA are big companies; this is a strong indicator of potential growth.
6. **Sixth Tweet:** ""baba bank of america corp . exchange URL $ baba $ ko $ cvc $ mcd baba tradeideas investing"" - Again, mentioning BOA could be positive for investors looking to trade ideas.
7. **Seventh Tweet:** ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . ask URL $ baba $ hgu.to $ kor.to $ sltd baba stock nasdaq"" - The company being held by Alibaba might indicate a strategic move towards growth, so this is positive.
8. **Eighth Tweet:** ""alibaba group holding ltd in race with URL promotes cloud computing | junior … URL $ baba"" - This talks about promoting cloud computing, which could lead to increased revenue and stock price growth.
9. **Ninth Tweet:** ""fnma federal national mortgage current price URL $ fnma $ dxj $ baba $ amba fnma invest stocks"" - BABA's role in mortgage financials might indicate a positive outlook, especially if the Fed is supportive.
10. **Tenth Tweet:** ""scty solarcity corp . investor opinions URL $ scty $ fcx $ baba $ dwti scty share nasdaq"" - Investors sharing views on solar energy could influence market sentiment positively.

**Overall Sentiment Summary:** All tweets discuss potential growth, strategic moves, or positive developments related to BABA. Each tweet contributes to a belief that the stock is undervalued and has room for improvement. The information reinforces investor confidence in BABA's future prospects."
2015-07-25,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let's see what each tweet says.

1. The first tweet mentions EFA, cure, BABA, EA, etc., which are medical related. Not directly tied to the target stock.
2. Second is about BIIB, CSCO, BAGA, XLB. Again, unrelated.
3. Third talks about SO, BABA, AEM, BYD, SO shares on PPSXL. It's about silver and BABA stock on S&P 500 bullish. So that's a bit of info but not directly about the target stock.
4. Fourth tweet from AT_USER about CSCO, CISCOPAL, etc., so again unrelated to the target.
5. Fifth is about VZ, WITGL, which are financials. Again, unrelated.
6. Sixth mentions BABA with TQQQ. It's a forum about BABA, but not related directly.
7. Seventh is about ROYAL GOLD, Inc., about gold. Not relevant unless it's part of another stock, probably not here.
8. Eighth is AA with ALCOA, which isn't the target.
9. Ninth is FB, Facebook, with inc and high value. Also unrelated.

All tweets are either financials, medical, or unrelated to the target stock. There's no mention of the stock directly in any tweet. Therefore, I don't have enough information to assess the impact on the specific stock price. The conclusion should be neutral because there's no direct link."
2015-07-26,Missing,File not found
2015-07-27,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze the given tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The output should be one of [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, looking at the target stock symbol, it's not provided directly in the tweets. But based on the context, these tweets seem to discuss various companies, including ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) and individual stocks. Since I don't have the specific stock symbol, maybe I can infer from the words used or assume a common one like SPY for S&P 500 ETF.

Looking at each tweet:

1. The first tweet mentions several stocks: spy, aapl, fb, etc., along with some hashtags. It's just an initial list of companies.
2. The second tweet continues listing more companies and includes some company-specific terms but doesn't specify the stock symbol.
3. The third tweet also lists multiple companies and includes some ETF-related terms.

Since I can't identify a specific stock, perhaps it's a generic company or index like SPY. However, without knowing the stock name, it's tricky. Maybe I should look at the sentiment expressed in these tweets.

The first tweet is very open-ended with a lot of ""subs"" and mentions multiple companies. It doesn't specify any positive or negative actions but just lists them. So maybe this isn't affecting the stock price much.

The second tweet continues listing more companies and includes terms like ETFs (esp) which could indicate investors are looking to trade ETFs, possibly making some participants enthusiastic about these platforms. The words ""up"" and ""down"" in that tweet might suggest mixed reactions but it's not clear if there's an overall trend.

The third tweet has both ""esp"" and some ETF-related terms, similar to the second. It mentions companies like teva, ogxi, etc., again indicating some interest or speculation about these platforms. However, without specific stock names, I can't say for sure.

Since all tweets are more about discussing trends and ETFs rather than a specific stock performance, it's hard to assess the impact on a particular stock. The user might be trying to gauge whether they should invest in a company based on this information, but without knowing the exact stock symbol or market context, I can't provide a clear positive, neutral, or negative sentiment.

Therefore, maybe the conclusion is [Neutral] because it's speculative and doesn't give a clear indication of the stock's performance."
2015-07-28,Negative,"Alright, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at each tweet individually, they all mention something about the stock being ""bearish"" or saying ""target of 2045."" That immediately tells me there's some negative sentiment involved because ""bearish"" means investors are selling the stock expecting it to go lower. Each tweet is repeating the same target, which makes sense as a way to communicate confidence in the stock's future performance.

Next, I need to analyze each tweet for positive and negative factors. However, since all tweets are pointing towards bearish sentiments with the same target price set by the user or some entity, there aren't any individual reasons to be positive or negative here. It seems like these tweets are reinforcing each other through repetition, which is a common tactic in negative trading to build momentum.

Now, assessing the sentiment, they all indicate a lack of confidence in the stock's potential growth and expectation that it might not increase. That's a clear indicator of negative sentiment because investors are cautious and prefer safer positions until clearer signals come in.

Putting this together, since every tweet points in the same direction—negative sentiment with repeated targets—they contribute to building a downward trend without any positive indicators. Therefore, combining all these factors leads me to conclude that the stock is likely in a negative sentiment."
2015-07-29,Neutral,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided five tweets and wants me to determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. It seems like all the tweets mention BABA (beta) as the target stock. So, I'm focusing on the performance of BABA relative to other companies mentioned in the tweets.

Looking at tweet 1: ""invest stocks wall street on front foot despite fed jitters : wall street on front foot ... URL $ fb $ aapl $ baba $ baa"" – Wait, no, actually it says ""Aapl $ baba $ ibm."" So maybe I misread. It's invested stocks in Wall Street, despite Fed Jitters. The target is BABA.

Tweet 2: ""AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER see my last target price for $ aapl $ tsla $ baba $ gpro $ twtr on URL"" – Target here is APL, TSLA, etc.

Wait, but I'm focusing on BABA. So the main targets are BAA (which might be Alpha Business, but it's not clear), ABL (Alpha Beta Life), and maybe others like GPRO and TWTR, which don't seem relevant.

Tweet 3: ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . eod data URL $ baba $ cgra $ uvxy $ gdx baba investing finance"" – Target is BABA again. It mentions Alibaba Group Hldg Ltd., so that's a relevant point about Alibaba, which might be a competitor.

Tweet 4: ""position of alibaba group holding ltd ’ s ( nyse : baba ) stock URL $ baba"" – Again, targeting BABA. This one mentions Alpha Beta Life again, maybe indicating more investor interest in BAA or another company.

Tweet 5: ""baba bank of america corp . ex-div date URL $ baba $ ua $ slw.to $ abt baba invest nasdaq"" – Target is BABA, and mentions Bank of America. It also talks about a dividend payment (ex-div) which might influence investor sentiment positively if the company's stock price reacts accordingly.

Now, for each tweet, I need to assess factors: positive or negative.

Tweet 1: ""invest stocks wall street on front foot despite fed jitters"" – This seems positive because investing is active, but the Fed Jitters part isn't clear. Maybe a bit mixed feelings.

Tweet 2: No obvious factors mentioned about BABA itself except for other companies. Not much to assess here.

Tweet 3 and 4: Both focus on BABA or similar companies. If there's buzz around Alibaba or other competitors, that could be positive, but if it's just noise, maybe neutral.

Tweet 5: Talks about dividend payments, which is a good factor for investors looking at stock prices because it can increase earnings. So this tweet has a positive factor.

Putting it together, most tweets are either neutral or have mixed feelings, especially the one about dividends. The others don't directly relate to BABA's performance. However, since Dividend Payback Ratios are a positive factor for investors, and the sentiment from the dividend info is positive (invest nasdaq), this tweet contributes positively.

So overall, considering all factors, there's a mix of negative, neutral, and positive aspects, but the one about dividends stands out as strong. Therefore, I think the sentiment leans towards [Neutral], because while there are mixed signals, most tweets don't strongly support or oppose BABA."
2015-07-30,Neutral,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to determine the impact on the stock price based on these tweets. So, I'm looking at five tweets here, and each one seems to be from different companies related to Biotech or similar fields. 

Starting with the first tweet: ""labu direxion daily s & p biotech bull 3x shares e . p . s . URL $ labu $ n $ baba $ f labu finance invest"". Hmm, this looks like a news piece from Labu Digital. They're saying it's a ""bull"" from S&P Biotech with 3X valuation. I think that means they expect the stock to go up, which is positive.

The second tweet: ""baba bank of america corp . company info URL $ baba $ tza $ wpg $ qid baba invest"". BABA is a biotech company known for its gene therapy stuff. They're saying it's valued at T-ZA, which I believe is the stock symbol. So, this is a statement about their valuations.

Third tweet: ""$ spnc spectranetics URL $ amrs $ ndrm $ lc $ nvgn $ vltc $ mnkd $ aria $ clf $ df $ aapl $ bac $ fb $ spy $ ge $ baba $ nflx $ c $ f"". This seems like a list of companies, some of which are related to Biotech. Spectranetics and others are biotech names.

Fourth tweet: ""fbiox fidelity select biotechnology last trade URL $ fbiox $ holx $ baba $ v fbiox investing tradeideas"". FBIOX is a stock mentioned here, along with Fidelity Select. It's talking about their performance at the last trade and investing.

Fifth tweet: ""k capital is giving away an hour long 1 on 1 trading lesson - for free ! enter to win here URL $ fb $ twtr $ aapl $ goog $ baba"". This sounds like a promotional offer from K Capital, mentioning Google and S&P Biotech. They're offering trading lessons.

Now, I need to assess each tweet's impact on the stock price. The first one is a news about their valuation, which could affect investor confidence. BABA being seen as bull suggests they think it will go up, so that's positive. 

Spectranetics and others are related to Biotech, but without knowing their current performance or specific info from these tweets, I can't say much. However, the third tweet lists a few companies; maybe some of them are performing well.

FBiox is mentioned, which might be a company with strong fundamentals. The fourth tweet says they're investing in Biotech. 

The fifth tweet is promoting an opportunity for trading at K Capital's lesson. That could attract investors, possibly increasing demand and thus affecting the stock price positively.

Putting it all together: Positive from the first tweet, potentially positive from spectranetics, neutral or slightly negative if some are doing poorly, and more positive from FBiox and the trading promotion. So overall, there seems to be a mix of positive and slight uncertainty, but leaning towards positive."
2015-07-31,Positive,"Okay, I'm trying to analyze the impact of these tweets on the company's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from all the tweets. Looking at them:

1. The first tweet mentions ""pensules"" which isn't a known stock symbol. Maybe it was an abbreviation or typo.
2. The second and third tweets discuss BABA (Balanced Anions Inc.), as it's one of the names used in the comments.
3. The fourth tweet also includes BABA.

So, I'll focus on BABA for this analysis since that seems to be the main stock mentioned.

Next, each tweet needs to be evaluated for positive and negative factors. Let me go through each one:

1. ""hack purefunds ise cyber security etf quotes URL $ hack $ gmf $ spxs $ baba hack share pennystocks"" – This looks like some kind of link to BABA stock using a hashtag, which is speculative but not clear on the content.
2. ""rt AT_USER baba alibaba group holding ltd . open URL $ baba $ rtn $ _rsx $ xom baba finance stocks"" – Includes ""baba finance stocks,"" so it's talking about trading strategies or stock holdings.
3. ""baba al Alibaba group holding ltd . open URL $ baba $ rtn $ _rsx $ xom baba finance stocks"" – Same content as the second tweet, reinforcing the idea of trading BABA and related stocks.
4. ""gasfx fbr gas utility index fund dividend URL $ gasfx $ qid $ baba $ mrk gasfx stockmarket pennystocks"" – Again, this is about trading gas utility funds and mentions BABA.

Now, assessing sentiment:

Each tweet seems to be promoting trades or holdings in BABA. The terms like ""baba finance stocks,"" ""gas utility funds,"" and mentioning trading strategies are all positive indicators of investor interest and potential buy signals. They suggest that there's support from the market for BABA and its related products.

Since each tweet is indicating confidence in BABA and related stocks, without negative comments about the stock itself or its performance, it leans towards a positive sentiment overall."
2015-08-01,Neutral,"Alright, let's try to figure out the impact on the stock price based on the given tweets. So, I'm looking at three tweets here.

The first tweet is ""altr altera corp . chart URL $ altr $ baba $ col $ goog altr stocks stocks."" Hmm, okay, it looks like a company name and some keywords with symbols. But without more context, it's hard to tell what exactly this tweet is about. It mentions ""chart,"" which could be related to financial charts or performance metrics of the stock.

The second tweet starts with ""bosocial : cpxx celator pharmaceuticals inc . prev close URL $ cpxx $ aapl $ baba $ all cpxx fin … URL."" This seems like another company, specifically ""celator pharmaceuticals inc."" The word ""prev close"" makes me think about recent stock performance. It's mentioning financial details and other companies briefly. Not sure if this relates to ""baba.""

The third tweet is ""$ baba only 3days to cover shortly be warned."" This clearly mentions ""baba,"" which I know is a tech company, especially related to Alpaca Inc., which was a big tech company in the past. The phrase ""cover shortly"" makes me think of a warning or release about their financial health or some upcoming news.

Putting it all together: altr and baba are both mentioned as companies. baba seems to be a name that's being closely monitored, especially with the warning about covering something in the next three days. This could indicate that investors are paying attention to this company and might be waiting for updates before making decisions about buying or selling their stock.

Considering the factors, I'd say there's a positive aspect because baba is getting some media coverage and possibly being warned. However, without knowing if it's a good signal or just bad news, it's hard to assign much weight. But overall, the presence of these keywords suggests something meaningful about baba that could impact stock prices."
2015-08-02,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company based on the given rules. The user has provided seven tweets and an output requirement where I have to conclude with ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"". 

First, let's go through each tweet one by one.

1. ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . day low URL $ baba $ gg $ brwc $ wynn baba trade ideas stocksbac bank of america …"" – This tweet mentions the company ""bank of America,"" which is a well-known financial services company. The mention of ""trade ideas"" and ""stocksbac"" might indicate potential investment opportunities or growth areas, so this could be positive.

2. ""pbr petroleo brasileiro (petrobras) ask size URL $ pbr $ baba $ cef $ dxj pbr investing stockmarket."" – PBR is another big energy company. The tweet talks about the stock being in the stockmarket and mentions ""size,"" which could suggest growth or increasing investor interest, so this seems positive.

3. ""Our stock alerts gained over 550% this month already ! see our huge new pick coming this week : URL $ segi $ baba $ swet."" – This is very encouraging with a big jump of 550%. It looks like the tweet is promoting a new investment with promising returns, which suggests a positive outlook.

4. ""$ shak shake shack URL $ hpq $ orcl $ pcln $ jpm $ baba $ aapl $ fb $ twtr $ nflx $ googl $ tsla $ amzn $ pcln $ prmtx $ fold $ scmp $ fv."" – This tweet lists several stock prices, but it's more about providing information rather than making a decision. It might not significantly impact the stock price in terms of positive or negative.

5. ""$ baba high fundamental rating -> URL URL"" – The mention of a ""high fundamental rating"" is positive because it indicates that the company's financial health is seen as strong by investors, which can lead to more optimistic stock movements. This tweet seems to suggest that the stock might rise.

6. ""rt AT_USER baba bank of america corp . ideas URL $ baba $ ashr $ gld $ gasl baba pennystocks investing."" – Similar to tweet 2, this is about PBR and their investment interests. The mention of ""pennystocks"" could be related to growth or diversification efforts, which might be seen as positive.

7. ""rt AT_USER fcn fti consulting , inc . company info URL $ fcn $ baba $ weat $ nugt fcn pennystocks nasdaq."" – Again, this is about financial companies but more focused on consulting and their presence in the nasdaq market. It's a bit vague, so it might not be as impactful.

Now, combining all these tweets: The first three are all positive or very strong signals from investors. There are mentions of big tech companies like PBR, bank of America, etc., which can drive stock prices. Tweet 5 is also positive because of the fundamental rating, which is a good indicator for investors to buy more.

The other tweets don't seem to provide substantial information that would significantly affect the stock price positively or negatively. They might indicate interest in a company but aren't strong enough to change investor sentiment much.

So overall, considering the most positive tweets and the context, I think this company is likely going to perform well."
2015-08-03,Neutral,"Okay, let's try to figure out how to assess the impact on the stock price for the given company based on these tweets. 

First, I need to look at each tweet and extract relevant information. The target stock is ""baba"" from the first tweet. So, I'll focus on tweets that mention ""baba."" Let's go through them one by one.

1. **Tweets 1-5:** These seem to be about other companies like BABA, BRWC, HAVells, MARISSA, and ALibaba. They talk about their stock prices or plans, investments, mergers, etc. While there are mentions of ""baba,"" the information isn't directly related to its financial performance yet.

2. **Tweets 6-13:** These include tweets where people are shorting BABA with puts, indicating a potential bearish sentiment due to market reactions but not providing specific price info.

3. **Tweets 7-10:**
   - **Tweet 7:** Talks about calls and stock holdings for XLV, which is related but doesn't mention BABA's performance.
   - **Tweet 8:** Indicating short positions with puts.
   - **Tweet 9:** Mentions calls, APLX, TWTR, etc., so no direct info on BABA.
   - **Tweet 10:** Shorting with puts for BABA. Again, just sentiment without price data.

4. **Tweets 11-13:** All relate to other sectors like ICLR and CYKL, not BABA specifically.

So, all relevant tweets are about other companies, especially those in tech or financials. There's no direct information about BABA's financial performance, earnings, or upcoming news that would impact its stock price. Therefore, the sentiment is neutral as the tweets don't provide concrete data on how it might affect BABA."
2015-08-04,Missing,File not found
2015-08-05,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of BABA stock. 

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at tweet 1, it mentions ""baba"", which is the ticker symbol for BABA. So that's our focus.

Next, each tweet should be broken down into positive and negative factors. For each tweet, I'll check if there are any URLs or terms that might indicate a change in the stock or related information. 

Looking at tweet 1: ""china to set up internet police in tech firms $ baba $ tcehy"" – this doesn't seem like it's directly about BABA. Maybe a typo or irrelevant term, so probably not affecting the stock.

Tweet 2: ""$ googl google URL avaのrpとか見ぬいた RDTHN 白猫で各职 1番好きなキャラ挙げてけ $ aapl $ bac $ fb $ spy $ ge $ baba $ nk"" – This one has ""googl"" which is Google, but again, not directly related to BABA. It mentions BABA, but it's unclear what the sentiment is.

Tweet 3: ""rt wallstjesus : largest changes in open interest : fb $ aapl $ twtr $ nflx $ baba $ googl URL … URL"" – Again, seems out of context or irrelevant. No mention of BABA here.

Tweet 4: ""AT_USER get long $ baba and short $ gdx - going against both of your instincts , but thats often how the market works . "" – This is a user's post about trading BABA and GDX. It talks about their strategy, not necessarily providing news that would impact the stock price. The mention of getting long BABA might indicate some expectation or action, but without real-time data or updates, it's hard to assess.

Tweet 5: ""$ baba"" – Just a single tweet about BABA without any context or analysis related to sentiment or factors affecting its price. It seems brief and unclear in its intent.

So, summarizing the tweets:
1. Unrelated
2. Relates but unclear context
3. Out of context
4. Trading strategy and action
5. Single tweet without details

Since none of these tweets directly mention BABA's performance or provide any relevant information about it, I don't see any positive, negative, or neutral sentiment indicators pointing towards the stock price changing."
2015-08-06,Positive,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how these tweets affect BABA stock. Let's see... The user provided four tweets and wants me to determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative for the stock.

First tweet: ""jim 5011 : baba bank of america corp . change URL $ baba $ osk $ amba $ panw baba finance pennys … URL"". Hmm, this seems like a link or navigation typo. Maybe it's just trying to access BABA stock from some unrelated source. I can't really assess anything here since it's not relevant.

Second tweet: ""$ baba alanc : short are you ? lol could lose : alanc URL"". This looks like an invitation for the user to ""short are you?"" which is a common strategy in trading. It might be signaling potential trades, but it's more about action than sentiment. I'm not sure if this will affect stock performance.

Third tweet: ""$ baba $ bidu : china stocks : opportunities within a troubled market : URL"". This mentions China stocks and a troubled market. While there might be some risks or opportunities due to geopolitical issues, the tweet itself doesn't seem to have positive or negative implications on BABA's own performance. It just provides info about China.

Fourth tweet: ""alibaba inks exclusive tie-ups with global brands to sell in china : san francisco ( reuters ) - alibaba group $ baba URL"". This is talking about Alibaba tying up with global companies and selling in China, which could impact BABA's growth. It sounds like a positive signal because it indicates potential for growth, especially if BABA is part of Alibaba's strategy.

So, out of the four tweets, the fourth one gives a positive outlook from Alibaba's strategic moves in China. The other three don't seem to have significant impact on BABA unless the first tweet actually changes something."
2015-08-07,Neutral,"Alright, let's break down how I approached analyzing these tweets for their impact on the stock price of BABA, or Alibaba Group Holding Limited.

First, I started by identifying the target stock symbol from each tweet, which was all the ""baba"" strings. Then, for each tweet, I separated them into positive and negative factors. Each factor had a URL with some information about BABA, like financial details, industry trends, or upcoming events. I also noted any URLs that were related to prices, such as stock updates.

Next, I assessed the sentiment of each tweet. For example, if there was an earnings preview from Deutsche Bank, it might indicate potential growth, so that would be a positive factor. On the other hand, if a dividend announcement comes up, that would likely be negative since investors expect higher dividends.

I considered each tweet's impact on investor sentiment. If a positive event like earnings is expected, it could push the stock price higher. Conversely, if there are concerns about upcoming events or financial issues, that might lead to sell pressure and lower stock prices.

Then, I went through all the factors for each tweet and categorized them accordingly. For instance, mentions of ""hydrophi technologies group"" in some tweets suggested potential economic issues that could negatively impact BABA.

After analyzing all tweets, I noticed they were spread across various financial aspects but mostly revolved around dividends, upcoming events, or industry trends. There weren't many positive statements about earnings or growth that stood out as strong.

Considering all the factors and sentiments, most of them were neutral because they were either supporting growth or concerns without significant directionality in sentiment. The stock prices didn't show a clear upward trend; instead, the factors oscillated up and down but didn't consistently indicate buy or sell pressure.

Therefore, combining these observations, I concluded that there was no consistent positive or negative influence on BABA's stock price based on the provided tweets."
2015-08-08,Neutral,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets regarding their impact on stock price for lng shares pennystocks. 

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. The first tweet mentions ""lng cheniere energy , inc . dividend URL $ lng $ baba $ gdx $ uup lng share pennystocks."" It looks like the stock symbol is ""pennystocks"" because it's the only one in quotes after the dollar sign. 

The second tweet is ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . quotes URL $ baba $ jnj $ ko $ veev baba finance investing"". Again, focusing on the last part, the stock symbol seems to be ""baba"". Hmm, wait a minute—both tweets mention ""baba"" but different stocks. That might complicate things because it could mean they're talking about different companies. 

But since the target stock is pennystocks, I should focus there. The first tweet mentions pennystocks as part of its URL and the last word is ""pennystocks."" So, the main tweet is for ""pennystocks"". 

Now, looking at each tweet: both talks about BABA (Baba Group) holding a group and mentioning some quotes on financial instruments. But since we're focusing on pennystocks, I should see if these tweets provide any information related to their performance or sentiment regarding them.

First tweet: It mentions ""baba"" as part of their holdings but doesn't directly talk about the stock performance of pennystocks. The URL includes BABA and GDX (Goldstone Xyz) among others. 

Second tweet: Similar, just with a different BABA mention. Again, not related to pennystocks.

So, maybe these tweets are just general statements about BABA's investments without providing specific information on their stock performance or sentiment towards pennystocks. Therefore, they might not have any significant impact on the price of pennystocks.

Therefore, I don't see any positive or negative information indicating a change in sentiment about the stock price of pennystocks from these tweets."
2015-08-09,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets about a company's stock symbol and determine their impact on the future stock price. The user provided some tweets: 1. ""voted top trading group . URL related : $ bac $ chk $ csco $ c $ amat $ baba $ atvi""

Hmm, let me break this down step by step. First, I need to identify the target stock symbol. Looking at the tweets, they all end with specific stock symbols: $ bac, $ chk, $ csco, etc. So each tweet is making a recommendation about one of these stocks.

The user's process involves identifying the target stock, analyzing each tweet as positive or negative factors, assessing sentiment, and then combining them into an overall sentiment summary.

Looking at the tweets:
1. ""voted top trading group . URL related : $ bac $ chk $ csco $ c $ amat $ baba $ atvi""

Wait a minute, that's a bit confusing. The tweet doesn't specify which stock it's talking about. It seems like it's mentioning various groups but isn't clearly stating the target stock. Maybe I should assume it's about one of these stocks without more context.

Each tweet is separate, so I have to evaluate each as an independent piece of information. Since they all end with a symbol, perhaps each represents a different company? That could mean multiple factors influencing the stock price for several companies at once. 

But wait, looking closer, it's a single tweet. Maybe there are multiple symbols here, but in reality, that's probably an error or a typo because it seems like one tweet isn't making sense as multiple recommendations.

Assuming it's about ""bac"" (Borat Chemical Co., Ltd.), which is a real company. So perhaps the user is suggesting to vote on this stock for some reason. But without knowing what they're voting for, it's hard to assess sentiment.

Alternatively, maybe each symbol represents different companies, and these are independent tweets suggesting their performance. In that case, I would have multiple factors from different stocks, each with their own analysis, which could complicate the overall sentiment.

But since all the symbols are specific, like $ bac, $ chk, etc., it's possible this is a single tweet discussing several companies at once. But in reality, a tweet can only mention one thing or prompt for multiple recommendations. So perhaps there was a mistake, and maybe it's supposed to be about a single stock.

Wait, let me check again. The user provided the tweets as:

1. ""voted top trading group . URL related : $ bac $ chk $ csco $ c $ amat $ baba $ atvi""

This seems like multiple URLs are combined into one tweet. That doesn't make sense because each symbol is a separate company, and that would be multiple recommendations in one tweet, which isn't standard.

Maybe it's a typo or mistake, but for the purpose of this analysis, I need to proceed as if it's about a single stock. So perhaps the user meant to mention ""bac"" and the rest are just URLs from somewhere else, possibly unrelated. In that case, each symbol would be its own tweet.

Wait, no, the way it's written is all one line with multiple symbols separated by spaces: $ bac $ chk $ csco $ c $ amat $ baba $ atvi. That seems like a concatenated URL or something similar, but without context, it's unclear which stock it refers to.

This is confusing because it's not clear what the target stock is and how these different symbols relate to each other. Without knowing which stock it's talking about, I can't determine its impact on the market. Maybe the user meant multiple stocks but mixed up their representations?

Alternatively, perhaps ""url related"" indicates that they are pulling a URL from somewhere else, but without further information, I can't figure out what it refers to.

Since I don't have clear context or target stock, I think this tweet is incomplete or ambiguous. Therefore, it's hard to assess the sentiment because I don't know which stock the user is suggesting for voting on. Without that information, the overall sentiment analysis is unreliable.

Perhaps the user made a mistake in providing multiple symbols without specifying the target stock. If they're trying to vote on a specific stock, maybe it's missing from the input, leading me to an incomplete analysis.

In conclusion, without knowing which stock the user is referring to (from $ bac, $ chk, etc.), I can't evaluate its impact on the stock price or determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral. This tweet lacks clarity in identifying the target stock and its relation to other factors."
2015-08-10,Positive,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of the company.

First, I need to identify the target stock mentioned in each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""$ jd stock nosedives on q2 loss - URL - $ baba URL"". It seems like the stock is ""jd"" or possibly a typo, maybe it's ""jdaa""? Or wait, no, the word after loss is ""q2 loss"", but I'm not sure about that. Anyway, the mention of ""baba"" in the second tweet stands out as significant.

In the second tweet: ""$ goog $ googl $ aapl $ fb $ amzn $ dis $ rrgb $ jwn $ baba AT_USER"". Here, ""g demand for "" and several companies are mentioned. ""G demand"" suggests that the stock is being overpriced or has potential for growth, which could be positive.

The third tweet: ""$ baba"" mentions Alibaba. It says ""e-commerce giant alibaba reports earnings"", so if Alibaba's earnings beat expectations, it could positively influence the stock price.

Looking at the fourth tweet: ""$ dnr $ gmcr"". GMCR is a gaming company, and its performance isn't directly related to ""baba"".

The fifth tweet mentions ""alibaba"" again, with an upbeat note: ""alibaba $ baba stock up after chinese electronic retailer deal URL"". The deal could improve their financials or market position.

In the sixth tweet: It lists various stocks like fous, 4x2 day trading, etc., which doesn't directly mention a stock named ""baba"", so maybe it's not relevant here.

The seventh tweet talks about Alibaba and a cloud-computing push. If they're investing heavily in cloud services, that could be a positive sign for their ecosystem or revenue growth.

The eighth tweet mentions a deal on trend to strengthen traditional industries using internet power. This is likely positive because leveraging technology can enhance performance and attract more investors.

The ninth tweet discusses stock prices on deck with ""pypl"", but I'm not sure what pypl stands for here. It doesn't directly tie into ""baba"".

Putting it all together: The tweets are mostly about Alibaba, baba (which is a gaming company), goog, amzn, dis (discount) and rrgb (maybe another tech company). There's mention of earnings reports from Alibaba and a deal that could improve their business operations.

Considering all the positive mentions like earnings reports and deals, along with the potential growth from the gaming sector, it seems likely that ""baba"" is undervalued. Therefore, the stock might have a positive sentiment."
2015-08-11,Positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price of BABA. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, the target stock is BABA. Now, looking at the first tweet: ""this week in china is $ baba earnings before the open tomorrow . that and any other fuckery they pull tonight ."" Hmm, this seems like a warning or negative statement about earnings. They mention ""fuckery"" which might indicate concerns about potential issues pulling the stock down.

Next tweet two talks about Aapl, Axp, Baba, etc., seeing if they can meet their target price. The user is suggesting they watch BABA earning in the morning and mentions ""baba earning in the morning."" This seems like a positive sign for investors because it's showing they're focusing on earnings.

Third tweet is RT AT_USER about what investors bought and sold last month, mentioning several stocks including BABA and others. It's more of an informational tweet with no clear direction or news that affects stock prices.

Fourth tweet mentions Stifel upgrading Goog to buy at a P/E ratio of 850 and upgrades other companies like BABA, BQU, GPRO, etc., with a target price. This could be positive because it's showing potential for buying bigger stocks, which might improve the stock price if they perform well.

Fifth tweet talks about notable opening imbalances in BABA, TQQQ, VZ, etc., but doesn't provide specific news that would influence stock prices. It just describes movements and losses for some stocks. So this could lead to volatility but not necessarily a clear up or down trend.

Sixth tweet mentions Alibaba's earnings tomorrow, which is a positive outlook because it gives investors more reasons to buy their stock. Positive earnings usually boost the price.

Seventh tweet mentions Alba Group holding limited focusing on BABA and others. This could indicate that the company is tracking BABA closely, possibly showing support or concern for its performance.

Eighth tweet from BABA mentions headwinds ahead of earnings, suggesting that the market might face issues before earnings are declared, which could lower prices if expectations aren't met.

Now, putting it all together: The first tweet and the sixth mention earnings, but they're mixed with concerns and positive outlooks. The fourth tweet shows a strategic move to buy stocks based on their P/E ratio, which is positive. However, there's some volatility in the fifth tweet about movements. But overall, the main positive signals are from the earnings statements and the outlook for Alibaba. I think these combine in a way that the stock might be up, but with some uncertainty."
2015-08-12,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze the tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of BABA (baba). Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. **First Tweet**: Says something about what to look out for in Alibaba's earnings report. This is positive because it sets expectations and encourages investors to stay tuned.
2. **Second Tweet**: Gives specifics about earnings numbers but doesn't mention any negative factors, so the overall sentiment isn't affected much.
3. **Third Tweet**: Also just shares details without specific news or negatives.
4. **Fourth Tweet**: Lists a bunch of companies but mentions big money makers and stock symbols, which is positive information for investors.
5. **Fifth Tweet**: Says that Fit and Gpro are down more than BABA, which might indicate a negative trend in those sectors.
6. **Sixth Tweet**: Shares earnings numbers from Alibaba, which could signal growth or performance, affecting the stock.
7. **Seventh Tweet**: Highlights concerns about China's financial troubles but speculates on their eventual recovery. This is neutral because while there are fears, they're not definitive.
8. **Eighth Tweet**: Talks about a company, baba, and mentions some investors' price targets. Negative could be the selling pressure if prices go up.
9. **Ninth Tweet**: Provides information about BABA's earnings call details, which is positive for potential stock movements.
10. **Tenth Tweet**: Mentions the Chinese economic situation and the company's performance, which could push stock prices down.
11. **Eleventh Tweet**: Talks about preparing for the opening bell in China, possibly indicating an upcoming market movement.
12. **Twelfth Tweet**: Claims $baba is at its all-time low, which is negative as it might drive price drops.
13. **Thirteenth Tweet**: Looks like trading ideas, so probably not a positive tweet related to BABA's stock performance.
14. **Fourteenth Tweet**: Lists other stocks but doesn't mention anything about BABA.
15. **Fifteenth Tweet**: Mentions several stocks and sends cryptocurrency information via tweets, which is more about the market rather than BABA itself.
16. **Sixteenth Tweet**: Also lists multiple stocks, so not directly related to BABA.
17. **Seventeenth Tweet**: Talks about large open interest among certain stocks, which could indicate higher volatility or investor sentiment changes.
18. **Eighteenth Tweet**: Link doesn't provide any information relevant to BABA.
19. **Nineteenth Tweet**: Discusses some stocks but mentions $baba and others, which is positive for investors.
20. **Twentieth Tweet**: Talks about China's economic situation and $baba's performance without specific negatives or positives.
21. **Twenty-first Tweet**: Cites yuan strength as a factor in Alibaba's earnings, which might affect the stock if the currency changes are bad.
22. **Twenty-third Tweet**: Reiterates that $ spy puts can pay off for $baba shares, indicating potential buying pressure.
23. **Twenty-fourth Tweet**: Another repeat of the same positive tweet about spy puts.
24. **Twenty-fifth Tweet**: Talks about yuan strength and Alibaba's earnings, which could influence stock prices if expectations change.
25. **Twenty-sixth Tweet**: Mentions sentiment towards BABA but doesn't provide specific data or negatives.
26. **Twenty-seventh Tweet**: Lists several stocks again, not related to BABA.

After analyzing all these tweets, the key points are:

- Positive tweets include mentions of earnings, trading ideas, and big money makers.
- Negative influences are evident from the down trends in Fit and Gpro (tweets 5 and 10), China economic issues (tweets 7 and 23), and potential sentiment shifts (tweets 14, 19).
- Neutral points include the chart of baba's potential day trade (tweet 27) but lack specific negative news.

Overall, while there are some negative signals about the market, BABA's stock is likely to experience a mixed movement. The positive tweets and the trend in trades indicate possible gains, but the negative trends might pull prices down. There hasn't been an overwhelming positive signal yet."
2015-08-13,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to figure out their impact on the stock price of BABA (BABA). Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, the target stock is BABA. So I'll focus on whether these tweets affect BABA's performance or not. 

Looking at tweet 1: It mentions selling calls at $5 from spy and aapl, but it doesn't directly talk about BABA. Maybe this is unrelated.

Tweet 2 talks about giving a buy rating to BABA with an update URL. That sounds positive because buying ratings can indicate investor interest or confidence in the stock.

Tweet 3 lists multiple stocks: aapl, tsla, spy, ebio, baba, fb, amda, twtr, googl, gpro. Some of these are related to BABA, like baba and googl (which is Google). However, this tweet seems more about general sentiment rather than specifically mentioning BABA.

Tweet 4 says analysts defend alibaba post-earnings with a share close down. Alibaba might be related, but the tweet is more about a company's performance rather than directly affecting BABA.

Tweet 5 mentions reductions in stock targets on alibaba and states a buy rating. Again, this is about another company, not specifically BABA.

Tweet 6 says analysts reduced their targets on alibaba without buying. Similar to tweet 4, this is about another company's performance.

Tweet 7 refers to wall street being bullish on baba with an url pointing to jd. This seems positive because bulls would want the stock to go up.

Tweet 8 discusses qcom's QCOM and some other companies. No mention of BABA here.

Tweet 9 mentions BABA, but it just says ""baba"" instead of ""BABA."" Maybe this is a typo or oversight.

Tweet 10 gives a headline about BABA as the black sheep with no actual positive or negative info.

So, looking at these tweets, the most relevant ones are tweet 2 (positive) and tweet 7 (very positive). Tweet 6 is also somewhat positive but less so. All others either mention unrelated stocks or don't directly affect BABA's stock price.

Putting it all together: Positive factors include selling calls on spy (which could be negative for spy, but not necessarily BABA), the buy rating for baba (positive), and a lot of other positive mentions about baba. Negative is minimal, mostly related to unrelated stocks. So overall sentiment seems positive."
2015-08-14,Neutral,"Alright, let's break down how I approached analyzing the given tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of cvx.

First, I identified the target stock symbol from the tweets, which was ""cvx"". Then, I looked at each tweet one by one. Each tweet seems to be related to different sectors: finance, energy, and technology. 

For the finance-related tweet, ""cvx stock message board URL $ cvx $ gld $ slw $ baba cvx finance stock"", I noticed that it mentions stock prices of $gld (Gold), $slw (Silicon Wafer Technology), and $baba (Baba Inc.). These are all financial instruments or companies in the stock market. The mention of these stocks suggests that the tweet is likely indicating investor sentiment about the broader tech and energy sectors, which could impact cvx.

The other tweets mentioned cryptocurrencies (gld) and a mix of tech-related stocks (slw, baba), but they didn't provide direct financial context or specific indicators of positive or negative events related to cvx. They were more anecdotal or speculative.

Considering that only the finance-related tweet provided actionable information about potential movements in sectors connected to cvx, it's reasonable to infer that the sentiment could influence investor views on tech and energy companies. However, without concrete details from other tweets, it's challenging to weigh the impact as a strong positive, negative, or neutral overall."
2015-08-15,Missing,File not found
2015-08-16,Negative,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The task is to figure out if it's positive, neutral, or negative based on the given tweets.

First, looking at the tweet provided: ""get news , views & analysis for various assets under one watchlist $ btc $ baba $ yelp URL URL"". It seems like this tweet is listing some information related to different assets and mentions Yelp as a URL. 

But wait, I'm supposed to analyze how this affects the stock price of a company. However, the tweet itself doesn't mention any specific stock or the company's performance. It just talks about gathering news on various assets and including Yelp's URL.

I might be missing some context here because without knowing which company we're talking about, it's hard to assess the impact. The user hasn't provided a target stock symbol or company name in these tweets, so I can't determine how this information affects any specific stock.

Since there's no mention of the stock being mentioned in the tweet itself, and no clear link between the assets listed ($ btc $ baba) to a particular company, it's impossible to evaluate the sentiment or impact on their stock price. 

Therefore, I think the best course is to assume that this tweet doesn't provide enough information about any specific stock. Without more context, such as which stock the user is referring to or any positive/negative indicators within these tweets, it's not possible to determine the overall sentiment.

So, in conclusion, without knowing the target stock and its current performance, I can't classify this tweet as [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. It doesn't seem to directly influence any specific company's stock price."
2015-08-17,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the given company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the posts, none seem to specify a particular stock symbol right now, so maybe it's an oversight or the user hasn't provided enough context. Wait, perhaps one of the hashtags is actually part of the stock name? Let me check again.

Looking back, tweet 1 mentions ""spx"", which I know stands for S&P 500 Index, a major US market index. That might be the stock in question since it's a significant component and listed on multiple exchanges. Tweets 2 and 3 include words like ""alibaba"" and ""baba,"" which are known companies, but without more context, I can't say for sure. Similarly, tweet 4 talks about O2O meaning for the future of e-commerce, with words like ""ale_bonacina"" and ""bidu."" This seems a bit off-topic unless it's related to a specific company.

Next, I'll break down each tweet into factors and assess their sentiment towards the target stock. Since tweet 1 is about the S&P 500 index, that would be our primary focus. 

Tweet 1 mentions ""activity in q2 2015"" with symbols like spx, ibm, wmt, pgnx, baba, amzn, goog URL. The user is referring to trends or activities during that period, which doesn't directly relate to the target stock. So tweet 1 might not have a strong impact on the S&P 500.

Tweets 2 and 3 mention ""alibaba,"" ""baba,"" etc., but again, without knowing the exact company name, it's hard to tell. However, if these were related companies, they could either support or contradict the target stock. For example, if a tweet is promoting a new product line that aligns with e-commerce trends, it might positively influence the stock.

Tweet 4 talks about O2O in e-commerce, which isn't directly linked to any known company. If the user meant a specific company related to that topic, like maybe a tech company or a business in that space, that could impact the stock. But as written, it seems off-topic.

Considering the lack of clear target stock information and the ambiguous tweets, I think the overall sentiment might be neutral. The main tweet is about market indices during 2015, which doesn't relate to any specific company's performance."
2015-08-18,Negative,"Okay, let me try to figure out the likely impact on BABA stock based on these tweets. So, first, I need to analyze each tweet and see if they have any positive or negative factors affecting the stock.

Starting with the first tweet: ""$ baba overall seems like sh0t , down to $ 65 then $ 60"". The word ""sh0t"" is pretty funny, which probably means people are upset. It sounds like a good sign because bad words can attract short-term gains or at least make investors feel hopeful about the stock's potential upside.

The second tweet is ""$ xlb $ gm $ dust $ baba tuesday morning market minute – $ xle $ lnkd $ spy URL"". This looks like it's offering shares of XLB and LNKD, which I know are related to SPY (the S&P 500 ETF). SPY being involved in internet crimes could be a negative factor because investing in something you might have made a profit or lost money is risky. However, if the tweet is just highlighting positive elements like XLE and LNKD, it's more about what you can get rather than the negative impact on the stock.

Third tweet: ""rt AT_USER china arrested 15,000 people allegedly involve in internet crimes $ baba $ wb"". This clearly mentions a serious issue with Chinese law, specifically arrests for illegal activities. Corporate corruption is always a red flag because it's a sign that something is wrong and could lead to a negative outcome if not handled properly.

Fourth tweet: ""$ wmt no bulls just bears $ shak $ ttwo $ vips $ frsh $ xon $ rrgb $ cybr $ fosl $ cree $ frpt $ baba $ m $ w $ csco $ juno $ v $ spy URL"". This tweet seems to state that there are no bullish signals, but it's a bit vague. It doesn't mention any positive news related to the stock, so maybe this is just a summary or a warning.

Fifth tweet: ""$ cntf on radar - one to watch this week $ baba $ fit $ aapl"". The word ""cntf"" also appears here, which could mean something negative or uncertain. ""On radar"" might imply it's under surveillance or not ready to be evaluated yet. So, this is vague but gives the impression that BABA needs attention.

Sixth tweet: ""we already booked 6 double digit winners this month $ spx $ tsla $ hd $ baba $ pcln $ rl URL join us and learn options trading"". This seems positive because it mentions booking successful trades with various stocks, including BABA. Positive news about successes could boost investor confidence.

Seventh tweet: ""AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER see my last trading ideas for $ spx $ aapl $ fb $ gpro $ baba on htttp :/ / investwall.com it's free"". Again, multiple ""AT_USER"" mentions and a link to a website. Without more context, it's hard to tell if this is positive or negative. It could be selling ideas that the user thinks are good, but without specific information about BABA's performance, it's speculative.

Now, putting it all together. The first tweet is definitely negative with ""sh0t"" and a down trend. But there's some hope in the second tweet because they're highlighting shares you can buy. Third tweet adds a serious issue, which could be bad. Fourth tweet doesn't mention positive news but mentions several stocks; maybe it's more about information than action. Fifth tweet is vague about needing attention. Sixth tweet is positive with successful trades booked.

But some tweets are speculative or just general offers without specific info on the stock. So overall sentiment might be a mix of good signs and potential negatives. It could be neutral because there are mixed signals—some positive, some negative—but it's not clear which dominates."
2015-08-19,Negative,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at tweet 1: It mentions that AT_USER is having a slowdown impacting Alibaba Group, Tencent, and JD.com's URL addresses, like BABA, JD, TCEHY, etc. Hmm, I'm not sure what AT_USER means here—maybe they're referring to the user? I think it might be about some sort of news related to these companies' performance or market positions.

Next, tweet 2 talks about technical scans for potential trading opportunities with various stock tickers like FB, GPRO, etc. Technical analysis is more about patterns in price and volume data rather than company-specific events.

Tweet 3 discusses how BABA moved up from selling fake to selling copycat names. The term ""copycat"" makes me think of strategies where a company sells its own products or services to others, like how companies can increase their valuation. This could indicate some strategic moves or possibly a temporary dip in stock price because people might be seeing it as a risk-reward situation.

Now, considering all these tweets: The first tweet is talking about the current performance affecting other major players. The second is related to potential technical trading activities. The third seems more about managing their own brand image by selling others' products. Combining these factors could imply some instability in the stock market or industry sentiment, but it's not clear if that's positive or negative.

I think overall, while there are elements of uncertainty and strategic considerations, they don't necessarily signal a strong upward trend. It might depend on how significant these points are relative to other news affecting the company. So maybe the overall impact is neutral."
2015-08-20,Neutral,"Okay, let me figure out how to analyze these tweets about the stock market and determine their impact on the stock price. 

First, I'll need to extract the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""alibaba group holding limited , $ baba , is down 1.68 . currently 71.89 ."" So, the stock symbol seems to be BABA or perhaps BAA since those are common symbols for airlines like Align, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. The price has gone down by 1.68%, so that's a significant movement.

The second tweet is more detailed: it lists several stocks and mentions their changes in dollars. This seems like a news release or earnings report where the stock prices are expected to change based on new information. Such reports can affect investor sentiment, but the exact impact isn't clear yet.

The third tweet is from a Twitter account by a user named RT AT_USER. It's talking about $baba and mentions things like ""how jerry yang made the most lucrative bet in silicon valley history"" and links to some stock prices (like YHOO). These kinds of tweets can sometimes be very short, but they might be indicating a specific event or analysis that affects the stock.

The fourth tweet is similar: it uses the same kind of hashtags and mentions $baba with a ""+"" 221k. It seems like another short tweet about an event related to BABA's price movements.

Now, for each tweet, I'll separate into positive and negative factors. For example, the third tweet might have a positive factor if it's talking about a significant event or analysis that could lead to BABA's price going up, but since it's short, I'm not sure. It could also be neutral because of the lack of specific information.

Similarly, in the second tweet, the detailed stock market news is likely affecting investor sentiment positively or negatively based on what they predict. If there are positive earnings reports or good news for certain sectors, that can push the stock up.

The fourth tweet's impact might be similar to the third one because it's about a price movement but without specific details. It could have neutral or slightly negative sentiment if the analysis is speculative or unclear.

After analyzing each tweet, I'll assess the overall sentiment by looking at how each factor contributes. If most tweets are positive about expected movements, that would lead to a positive overall sentiment. Conversely, mixed or conflicting information might result in a neutral stance.

In this case, considering the third and fourth tweets mention changes in stock prices but don't provide specific details on why these price changes occur, it's hard to say definitively whether they are positive or negative. However, given that these are short tweets, there might be uncertainty involved, which could make the sentiment neutral."
2015-08-21,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided 7 tweets, all in dollars and mentioning stocks like $baba (BAC), $intc (Intellixent), $aepl (AEP), etc. I should identify each tweet's factors and sentiment.

First, looking at each tweet individually:

1. ""get news , views & analysis for various assets under one watchlist $ btc $ baba $ yelp URL URL"" – This seems like a link to stock research tools or services. It might not directly mention the stock symbols, so maybe it's more about providing information rather than influencing investor sentiment.

2. ""$ baba stock dipping amid fresh signs of china economic slowdown"" – Here, BAC is mentioned along with China's economic situation. A slowdown could mean uncertainty and potential drop in stock price. But without knowing the broader context, it's hard to say if it's positive or negative.

3. ""$ intc $ baba : the 52 - week low club for friday : URL"" – This tweet is a bit unclear. It mentions both BAC and Intellixent, but the phrase ""the 52-week low club for friday"" doesn't relate to stock prices. Maybe it's part of a website or information dump without actual stock data.

4. ""most active services stocks - american eagle outfitters , inc . ( nyse : aeo ) , comcast … URL $ baba"" – Again, this is talking about services companies but doesn't mention BAC directly. It seems more like general information unless there's an actual stock being referred to here.

5. ""$ baba alibaba group holding ltd ( baba ) stock hits another 52 - week low"" – This mentions a specific stock (BABA) and its price action. If the stock is dropping, that could be a negative factor for investors who are eyeing BAC.

6. ""$ baba buyable zone for long run."" – This seems to imply that BBA will be more affordable in the future, which might encourage current or long-term investors to hold onto shares. It's a positive outlook on growth potential.

7. ""les 5 actions avec les volumes sur options les plus importants aujourd'hui : $ aapl , $ fb , $ bac , $ nflx et $ baba . les ..."" – This tweet is about options trading and mentions multiple stocks, including BAC. It doesn't mention any price changes or movements of BBA.

Now, combining the factors:

- BCC (BABA) has hit another 52-week low. That's bad news for investors who are targeting this stock.
- China economic slowdown could cause a dip in BCC stock prices.
- There seems to be uncertainty about future growth and price movements.
- A positive outlook on long-term affordability but no actual price action.

So, the factors are mixed: some bad news (dipping low) and one good outlook. But without concrete data or immediate price changes, it's hard to weigh them all together.

I think the overall sentiment is a mix of both negative (dips) and positive (growth prospects). It might lead to mixed results but could prompt some investors to reconsider their positions."
2015-08-22,Neutral,"Okay, so I have to analyze these tweets to figure out if they'll affect the stock price of BABA. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First tweet: ""at level where tutes bought . if that breaks no real support . $ baba URL"". Hmm, it seems like this is about the user buying tutorials and thinks there's not much support, so they're considering selling. Maybe some negative sentiment here because of the lack of support and possible sell pressure.

Second tweet: ""rt AT_USER bears claw at recent ipos $ bntc $ twtr $ baba $ plnt $ betr $ run $ cnfr $ ntec ipo … URL URL"". This looks like a list of stocks, specifically focusing on BABA. The mention of ""bears claw"" in quotes might indicate some negative outlook or expectation for decline, but it's too vague to be certain.

Third tweet: ""$ mbly $ moh $ fbhs $ baba $ fb $ cpa $ bofi $ lii $ tso $ dhi $ sabr URL"". These are company names. Without more context, it's hard to tell if they're positive or negative. They could represent good news or bad, so this tweet is quite vague.

Fourth tweet: ""unusual options activity : vix , aapl , tsla , and baba URL $. $ baba"". This seems like BABA has some options trading. Options can be either good (if the stock moves up) or bad (if it goes down). But without knowing how it's affecting the price, I can't say for sure.

Overall, the first tweet is selling pressure, which could lead to negative sentiment. The others are too vague and hard to assess. So, combining these, I think there might be some negative influence due to the sell order, but it's unclear from other tweets."
2015-08-23,Missing,File not found
2015-08-24,Neutral,"Okay, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of BABA. I'm not too familiar with all the financial terms here, but I'll do my best.

First, looking at the tweet one by one:

1. ""rt AT_USER oh and here's alibaba ... $ baba URL"" - Hmm, this seems like a link to a new company or another stock, maybe related to Alibaba? It could be pushing someone else's profile or suggesting something else entirely. Without more context, it's hard to say if this is positive or negative for BABA.

2. ""rt AT_USER breaking : alibaba down 13.8 percent . $ baba"" - This tweet mentions that Alibaba is down by 13.8%. That sounds like a significant news that might impact investor sentiment. If there's a downward move, especially on a large percentage, it could be negative.

3. ""active stocks to watch : dreamworks animation skg inc . ( nasdaq :d wa ) , alibaba group … URL $ baba"" - This tweet is talking about active stocks, specifically mentioning梦游动画、达沃斯和阿里巴巴。It seems like they're suggesting new companies in the entertainment industry that might be worth watching. This could be positive if those companies are promising growth or if it's just a call to action for investors.

4. ""rt AT_USER the youngest suffer the most : recent ipos getting slaughtered . URL $ box $ etsy $ twtr $ baba URL"" - Here, there are mentions of specific websites: Box,etsy, Twtr, and BABA. It seems like someone is focusing on social media platforms or maybe specific platforms where stock prices might be affected. This could be either positive if it's about attention to the platform or negative if it's a red herring.

Now, putting this all together. The first tweet looks like a random link, so probably not meaningful. The second one gives a significant drop in Alibaba's percentage. The third suggests new stocks that might have growth potential. The fourth mentions social media platforms which could affect investor sentiment.

Considering the overall impact: A large negative news about Alibaba (second tweet) and positive mentions of other companies (third tweet). Without knowing how the rest of BABA's performance is affecting its stock price, it's a bit tricky. But since there are both positive and negative tweets, it might lead to some mixed sentiment. Maybe neutral? Or perhaps leaning towards overall negative because of the large loss.

Wait, but sometimes social media can tip the scale. If many people are watching these tweets, especially the ones about other stocks, that could push BABA's price down. But if the positive tweet is just a call to action and not actually providing any information or proof, it might not have a huge impact. Similarly, the large drop in Alibaba would definitely affect the stock.

So overall, I think there's a significant negative factor from Alibaba's performance and some positive calls to watch for other stocks. Since these tweets are just notifications without actual updates on BABA, they probably don't directly influence the stock price. The other factors might cause some volatility but not necessarily a net effect that would make it ""Positive"" or ""Neutral."" It could be in between, maybe [Neutral]."
2015-08-25,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of BABA (BABA) based on the provided instructions.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol. Looking through each tweet, it seems like none of them directly mention a specific stock. Some mention words like ""baba"" or terms related to technology companies, others talk about investing in sports teams or other industries. Hmm, this is a bit confusing because without knowing the exact stock being referred to, I can't determine its current price.

Wait, maybe each tweet is separate and referring to different stocks? Let me check again:

1. Trade - $baba: This seems like an offer to enter a long position at 69.35 on BABA.
2. wfm wal-mart stores , inc.: Discussing information about the company, possibly for investors.
3. spxl direxion: Also talking about stocks and investing topics.
4. AT_USER el impacto del batacazo bursatil en las tecnologicas chinas - This seems like an attempt to mention a product or service related to BATACAZO (which might be a company, maybe Excel? Or it could refer to something else).
5. baba tcehy: Maybe talking about another stock?
6. hgu.to herbalife ltd.: Discussing herbalife and BABA.

It's clear that these tweets are about different companies or related products, not specifically mentioning BABA as the target. So without a specific stock name, it's impossible to assess its impact on BABA's future price.

Since I can't identify which stock is being referred to by ""baba,"" I need to decide how to proceed. Maybe each tweet is separate and refers to different companies or related products, so perhaps there are multiple stocks whose sentiment needs to be evaluated? Or maybe the user intended for one of these tweets to target BABA?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo or miscommunication in the user's intent. Without knowing which stock exactly they're referring to, I can't make an accurate analysis.

In such cases where the tweet doesn't specify the target stock, I should probably look at each tweet individually and consider them as separate entities. That would mean analyzing each one for their own sentiment relative to whatever stock is being discussed. But since none of these tweets mention BABA, it's challenging to determine if they have a positive or negative impact on BABA.

Maybe the user intended to target multiple stocks but made a mistake in selecting ""baba"" as a keyword. Alternatively, perhaps one of the tweets mentions BABA indirectly, which might give a clue. Let me look again:

Looking at tweet 5: It says ""baba tcehy,"" and then adds links like ""brows beat and available see fb now URL."" There's also a mention of TCEHY (TCLX), which is a stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Similarly, other tweets have mentions like ""foxconn $bidu"" and others. 

I think it might be that these tweets are discussing different stocks or related products for investors, but without knowing the specific stock, I can't assess BABA's potential impact.

In conclusion, since none of the provided tweets specify a target stock symbol related to BABA (BABA), I cannot determine the overall sentiment on how BABA will perform. However, if there's any tweet that mentions or discusses BABA specifically, its sentiment could be assessed by looking at the words and terms it uses.

But in this case, all the tweets don't mention BABA directly. Therefore, without additional context about what stock is being referred to as ""baba,"" I can't make an accurate assessment of BABA's future price impact."
2015-08-26,Negative,"Alright, I'm looking at these tweets trying to figure out their impact on the stock price of baba. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I need to identify which company is being referred to since some are missing the symbol. It seems like baba is the main focus here because several tweets mention ""baba."" 

Looking at the first tweet: it's talking about daytrading and suggesting to check out the secrets within. The user includes $ jdst, $ baba, etc., so that's definitely baba.

The second tweet mentions baba alibaba group holding ltd., which I know is a company related to baba. They list several stocks but don't specify the symbol for baba here.

Third tweet: cvs health corp and shares URL, again pointing out baba.

Fourth tweet: cop knows phillips and invests. That's about another company, not baba.

Fifth tweet says yesterday was green, I was bearish, which affects investor sentiment but doesn't directly mention baba.

Sixth tweet is a comment on stocktwits: the user is upset because baba was green yesterday, but they're talking more generally about traders. The initial statement mentions ""dude $ baba,"" which might be referring to another company, so this isn't clear if it's about baba.

Seventh tweet: RT mentioning baba bank of america, which I think is the user talking about a different company.

Eighth tweet updates on stock performance with a big new pick. That likely affects investor sentiment towards baba.

Ninth tweet talks about short sales and gains in past year for baba. Positive info that could be good news.

Tenth tweet: BZQ's international corp, which doesn't mention baba.

Eleventh tweet mentions drys and trade ideas on pennystocks. Doesn't seem related to baba.

Twelfth tweet is about drys ships inc., which again isn't baba.

Now, compiling the factors:

Positive aspects:
- $ segi update: Maybe a new significant stock pick, positive.
- $ swet: Another update, possibly another company or baba's own pick.
- baba gains past year with big updates.
- BABA's short sales increase and recent gains suggest potential upside.

Negative aspects:
- Some tweets are about other companies not related to baba. For example, the user in tweet 6 mentioned a general discussion without specifically mentioning baba.
- The negative comment about being green yesterday might have been about another company, but it's speculative if that relates to baba.

Putting this together: There are positive signs like updates and gains, but there's uncertainty about whether these affect baba directly. It seems baba is in the news positively but without concrete evidence of a buy or short position, making it hard to assess impact definitively."
2015-08-27,Neutral,"Okay, so I have to analyze these tweets to figure out their impact on the stock price of a company and determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. That might not be straightforward because some tweets seem like they could refer to different companies, but maybe most are related to a specific stock. For example, looking at tweet 1: ""tbev high performance beverage co . change URL $ tbev $ fit $ googl $ baba tbev investing stocks."" Hmm, it seems like this is about TBEV or maybe TBEV Inc. So I think the target stock here is likely TBEV.

Looking at tweet 2: ""xlk technology select sector spdr filings URL $ xlk $ wmt $ tsla $ baba xlk finance tradeideas."" xlk is a ETF that tracks S&P 500, so this might be related to SPY or another S&P ETF. It mentions tech stocks like TSLA and BABA, which are known for their performance in the tech sector.

Wait, but I'm supposed to analyze each tweet separately? Or treat them as separate events affecting a single stock? The user provided ten tweets, but it's unclear whether they all pertain to one company or multiple. Hmm, that's an issue. Without more context, it might be challenging, but perhaps the user wants me to treat each tweet as a potential event for different stocks.

But since the output needs to conclude with one line about the stock in question, maybe I need to infer which tweet refers to the same company. Alternatively, maybe they all relate to a single company's performance. Let me check each tweet again:

1. tbev investing stocks: likely TBEV
2. xlk and others: SPY or another ETF for tech
3. etsy and baba: maybe unrelated
4. nke: possibly NKE, but the sentiment might not be clear
5. baba alibaba group holding: could be related to BABA or ALBANQUA
6. etsy and baba again
7. kgc:kinross gold, which might be a different company
8. baba - UberChina's deal for $1 billion in funding
9. blta: maybe BLTA, another company
10. aapl, apple; baba; bce; bidu etc.

This is confusing because the same stock can't be in multiple tweets. Maybe each tweet is about a different company? Or perhaps they're all related to BABA or something else.

Alternatively, maybe these are market reports or financial statements that provide information about the company's performance without affecting their actual stock price directly. So, perhaps I should look for positive or negative news related to investing or trading ideas but not necessarily impacting the underlying stock's value.

Wait, if all tweets are about different aspects of a company's operations, like earnings reports, product launches, etc., maybe they don't affect the stock's price directly. That complicates things because I can't see any positive or negative trends here without more context.

But looking back at the output requirements, it says to conclude with one line stating [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative] about the stock. So perhaps all tweets are meant to indicate something about a specific stock's performance in the last 30 days, like market updates or earnings calls that could impact its price.

Let me check each tweet again:

1. tbev: Maybe TBEV Inc., but it mentions ""investing stocks,"" which might not be news impacting the stock.
2. xlk: SPY or similar ETF for tech.
3. etsy: Maybe unrelated to a company's performance.
4. nke: Possibly NKE, but unless there are earnings calls or something like that, I don't see positive or negative sentiment.
5. baba alibaba group holding: If this is about BABA stock, maybe an update on their performance or financials from a recent meeting.
6. etsy and baba again—maybe same as tweet 5.
7. kgc: kinross gold, which I don't see any indication of impacting the stock.
8. $ baba - UberChina deal for $1 billion in funding: This is a specific investment deal, but unless it's about operational changes or financials, it might not affect the stock price.
9. blta: Maybe BLTA Inc., unrelated information.
10. aapl: Apple, which impacts the stock price.

Wait a minute, all these tweets seem to be talking about BABA stock or related companies. For example, tweet 5 and 6 mention ""baba alibaba group holding ltd."" So maybe they're indicating that Alibaba Group is still involved in certain projects or investments, but not necessarily impacting their stock's price directly.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'investing stocks' tweets are about a company listed on an exchange (like TBEV Inc.), and other tweets mention specific companies like SPY, which might indicate that those are ETFs for tracking indices. But without more context, it's hard to say.

Given that, maybe all the tweets are just providing information or updates regarding different aspects of a stock but not directly impacting its price. In that case, perhaps there's no positive or negative sentiment based on this data alone because each tweet is about different companies or unrelated information.

But if I have to choose one, considering tweet 5 mentions ""baba alibaba group holding ltd."" which could be a red herring if it's not related to BABA. Or maybe it's an indication that the company still has certain products or partnerships, but again, this doesn't directly affect their stock price.

Wait, but looking at some tweets: ""tencent : o canada !"" is about Tencent investing in Canada and mentions ""o canada,"" which might refer to a project. ""blta: market cap URL"" could indicate a news update on Alibaba Group's market cap, but again, not directly impacting the stock.

I'm starting to think that without more context or prior knowledge about these stocks, it's impossible to determine their sentiment based solely on these tweets. Therefore, perhaps all tweets are irrelevant for this analysis, and the conclusion would be [Neutral], as there's no information to suggest a positive or negative impact.

Alternatively, maybe I missed something in the tweets. For example, tweet 8 mentions BABA investing in a $1 billion funding deal, which could indicate that they're expanding into new markets or partnerships, but unless this leads to increased demand for their stock, it might not affect the price directly.

But considering all of these, and without any positive or negative trends visible, I think the overall sentiment would be neutral."
2015-08-28,Neutral,"Alright, let's break down how I approached this task.

First, I needed to figure out which tweet contributed the most information about the stock JCP. The first tweet listed several stocks like JCP and provided a URL. While that was useful, it wasn't very specific about the stock in question, so I considered the second and third tweets as more relevant because they mentioned JCP.

Looking at the second tweet, it talked about GMY and gave a hold rating with some hope for future disappointment. That's pretty positive, which suggests that investors are looking ahead and aren't expecting bad news. It does mention BABA, but since it's not JCP specifically, I might need to be cautious here.

The third tweet mentioned CVX and others on the message board. CVX is a known company related to JCP (I think JCP owns CVX), so this tweet provided direct information about JCP stock. It also mentioned other stocks like pennystocks, which could imply broader market sentiment but didn't specify if it's positive or negative.

When I looked at the first tweet, while it was a good starting point with a high five-year high, it wasn't specific to JCP and included several unrelated stocks. So, without clear information about JCP, it might not be as helpful for assessing the stock's performance.

Combining these thoughts, the third tweet provided direct info on JCP, which is crucial because it's our target stock. The mention of other stocks on the message board could suggest a broader market trend but doesn't necessarily indicate positive or negative sentiment for JCP itself. The tweet does include a hold rating and hopeful outlook, which are strong indicators that investors are optimistic about future performance.

I considered whether to ignore the first tweet because it was too vague, but I realized that without specific information on JCP's stock, the most impactful tweet would be the one providing direct details. Therefore, despite including other unrelated stocks, the third tweet still carried significant weight for analyzing JCP's sentiment."
2015-08-29,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price of a company based on their given information. The user provided two tweets, and I have to decide whether each is positive, neutral, or negative.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""fv first trust dorsey wright focus 5 etf ask URL $ fv $ baba $ amzn $ itb fv stocks nasdaq"". Hmm, that seems like a list of stock symbols. The words include ""etf"" which is an ETF, ""baba"" and ""amzn"", and others like ""nasdaq"". These are all company names or related to investing. I know that companies listed on the NASDAQ are often referred to as ETFs because they're traded on that platform, but this tweet doesn't seem to indicate anything about their stock performance.

Next, the second tweet: ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . stock forum URL $ baba $ rsx $ ge $ bobe baba share stock"". Again, it's a list of stock symbols. Alibaba is a well-known company in China. BABA is another ETF related to aluminum. The mention of ""bobe"" doesn't make much sense here; perhaps that's a typo or a placeholder.

Both tweets have stock names and other unrelated terms like ETFs and company abbreviations. I don't see any positive indicators about the company's performance, financial health, or upcoming projects. Instead, they might be just listing things without providing context on what could impact their stock price. So, I think neither tweet is providing any useful information to determine if the stock will go up, down, or stay the same."
2015-08-30,Neutral,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. The stock symbols are mentioned here: baba, pkw, sltd, iwm, spy, qqq, iwm is another symbol, tsla, aapl, ibm, etc., but let's focus on the ones provided like baba and pkw.

Looking at the tweets:

1. ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . last trade URL $ baba $ itb $ je.to $ nflx baba finance pennystocks"" – This seems to be information about baba stock, specifically NFLX (Nflx). So target stock is baba.

2. ""pkw powershares buyback achievers news URL $ pkw $ sltd $ rye $ baba pkw tradeideas stockmarket"" – This mentions pkw stock and a buyback announcement for powershares, so target is pkw.

3. ""invest stocks contextualizing facebook's 1 billion daily users with 6 graphs : facebook ... URL $ fb $ aapl $ baba $ ibm"" – Here, both Facebook (FB) and BABA are mentioned as targets.

4. ""opening up chat room for limited time URL $ spy $ qqq $ iwm $ tsla $ aapl $ fb $ amzn $ nflx $ uso $ dia $ twtr $ baba $ gpro $ amba"" – This includes multiple stocks: spy, qqq, etc., and mentions FB again.

5. ""ea electronic arts , inc . financials URL $ ea $ sa $ sbux $ baba ea stock nasdaq"" – Discusses EA and their earnings, targeting BABA.

6. ""get news , views & analysis for various assets under one watchlist $ btc $ baba $ yelp URL"" – This looks like it's about BABA but not specifically mentioning its symbol elsewhere in the tweets.

Now, to determine the impact on stock price, I need to assess each tweet's sentiment and factor. Let me go through them:

1. Informational tweet about NFLX (baba), which is a positive point as it's an indicator of company performance.
2. Buyback announcement for pkw – This could either be positive if it helps with cash flow or negative if bad news.
3. Contextualizing Facebook's data and 6 graphs – Positive because more information is available, which can improve investor confidence.
4. Multiple companies opening up chat rooms – This is positive as it might attract more users or increase visibility in the market.
5. EA earnings report – Positive because earnings are a good indicator of company health.
6. General news about BABA – Some info but not specific to the stock symbol.

Considering all these, each tweet seems to have mixed sentiment, with some being positive and others neutral or slightly negative. For example, the buyback announcement for pkw could be ambiguous, but overall, the information is generally good or neutral."
2015-08-31,Negative,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets about the BABA stock and determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative in terms of impact on the stock price. Let me break this down step by step.

First, from the user's instruction, I remember that each tweet is about a stock symbol followed by some other information. The target stock here seems to be BABA since it appears in multiple tweets as $ baba and also mentioned ""mu"" before ""mgm"", which might refer to mu company. But I'll focus on BABA for now.

Let me go through each tweet one by one.

1. ""alibaba $ baba stock falls on troubled chinese economy URL""
Okay, so this tweet mentions that Alibaba's stock is falling because the Chinese economy is troubled. The Chinese economy being troubled could indicate a negative environment which might affect investor sentiment towards BABA. Since I'm not familiar with BABA's industry, but assuming it's in a sector facing economic challenges, this could be a positive or neutral impact depending on how the situation affects the company.

2. ""rt AT_USER $ yhoo $ baba $ msft $ bby $ fit $ mu $ mgm $ expr fib charts URL""
This tweet is in Chinese and seems to list several stocks. The mention of various companies like YHOO, MSFT (which I think is Microsoft), BRY (Bryant) stock, etc., along with MU and MGM. Since it's about multiple stocks listed on the same platform, this might indicate a broader market condition affecting these stocks collectively. If the Chinese economy is doing well here, but some companies listed are facing issues, it could be a mix of positive and negative signals.

3. ""gpor . l goldman sachs group , inc . current price URL $ gpor . l $ sirgq $ baba $ xlb gpor . l finance tradeideas""
This tweet talks about Goldman Sachs (GS), which is a financial services company, mentioning it has a current price and links to finance and trade ideas. BABA here refers to another stock, possibly in the financial sector. If GS is performing well and they're trading ideas that could influence BABA, but without specific info on how this impacts BABA's performance, it's hard to say. Maybe neutral as no direct information.

4. ""praapra pra group , inc . ideas URL $ praa $ rcpi $ baba $ ery praa pennystocks tradeideas""
This seems to be related to another financial company, PRAA Pra Group, with some tech and finance keywords. The mention of TRCPI (which I think is the Consumer Price Index) could indicate cost-of-living issues or inflation, which might impact BABA's stock. If this affects employees' costs, it can lower BABA's net profit. So maybe negative sentiment if this impacts employee morale.

5. ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . open URL $ baba $ gld $ schw $ ges baba stock invest""
This tweet mentions BABA as a holding by Alibaba Group. The price is listed, and they're investing in BABA. If the Chinese economy is troubled (as mentioned earlier), it might lead to lower interest rates or economic uncertainty, which could make BABA stocks more attractive because investors are cautious. So this would be positive.

Now, I need to evaluate each tweet's impact on BABA. 

- Tweet 1: Economic trouble affects Alibaba, possibly good if the economy is bad for other companies.
- Tweet 2: Multiple companies listed might indicate broader market conditions, could be mixed.
- Tweet 3: GS trading ideas doesn't directly relate to BABA, so maybe neutral or not enough info.
- Tweet 4: Cost-of-living issues from TRCPI might lower net profit, negative.
- Tweet 5: Alibaba Group is a major player and higher interest rates could boost their stock.

Putting it all together, most tweets either mention economic conditions (positive) or other companies (neutral). The cost of living impact in tweet 4 makes BABA's stock more vulnerable. So overall sentiment is leaning towards negative because the economic factors and other companies' performance are causing uncertainty."
2015-09-01,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets about AT_USER's stock performance and determine if it will be positive, neutral, or negative for Amazon's future stock price. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually.

The first tweet says ""rt AT_USER why the china internet etf has endured alibaba's tumble $ amzn $ baba $ fxi URL via AT_USER."" Hmm, that seems like a request from a user to his/her self about something, but I'm not sure what it's referring to. It mentions a company called China Internet ETF enduring a Tumbleweed status in Alibaba. That could be affecting Amazon, which is part of Alibaba's ecosystem. So this tweet might indicate a possible negative impact on Amazon's stock.

The second tweet says ""out of $ cam for - 35 % . blew that one . bto oct 62.5 $ baba . small and cautious ..."". The phrase ""out of"" suggests that the user is referring to a performance percentage, maybe a loss of 35%. It mentions ""small and cautious"", which could indicate cautious trading or investor concern about safety. This might lead to uncertainty in Amazon's stock.

The third tweet says ""AT_USER $ baba / china certainly in the running for this cycle ."" Again, it seems like a request from a user pointing out that BABA is performing well enough to be part of this current cycle. If BABA is doing well and is being seen as part of the trend, this could be a positive sign for Amazon's stock.

Putting these together: The first tweet suggests a potential negative impact due to China Internet ETFs. The second tweet points out some losses but mentions cautious actions. The third tweet attributes success to the current cycle. So overall, there seems to be mixed signals—some positive and some negative. However, BABA's position in Alibaba's ecosystem might have created some risk for Amazon, making it seem a bit uncertain but not entirely negative. Maybe the overall sentiment is neutral because while there are mixed thoughts, most of them aren't extreme enough.

So I think the overall sentiment is Neutral."
2015-09-02,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price of the company in question. Let's start by breaking down each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the target stock, it seems to be something related to BABA since there are mentions like ""baba news updated wednesday."" But without knowing the specific company, I can't determine the exact impact yet. Maybe I should focus on the factors mentioned in each tweet and see how they relate to the stock.

The first tweet is ""get news , views & analysis for various assets under one watchlist $ btc $ baba $ yelp URL URL."" Hmm, this seems more like a query about accessing information or viewing content rather than stock updates. It mentions different assets but doesn't specify which ones. So maybe it's not relevant to the stock price prediction.

The second tweet is ""$ baba news updated wednesday , september 2 , 2015 11:59 : 37 am $ vnq $ xle $ tbev URL."" This one seems to be providing a specific date and time for an article or report about BABA. The mention of September 2, 2015 adds a timeframe, but without the content itself, it's hard to assess sentiment.

Since I can't extract the stock symbol from these tweets (as neither mentions a company like ""BABA""), I'm unsure if I should be considering this. But maybe each tweet contributes some data that's relevant. The first one is more of an operational tweet about accessing information related to various assets, which might indicate they have content on different markets. The second tweet gives a specific date for a news update, possibly indicating potential earnings or market insights.

I need to combine these factors. The first tweet shows access to information across multiple assets, which could mean the company has diversified its operations. The second tweet updates the company with a news event on September 2, 2015, giving a date and time. If that event is positive (like earnings, product launches), it might boost stock price.

But without knowing if the events are positive or negative, I can't be certain. Also, the first tweet doesn't directly mention any stock, so maybe its content isn't related at all. This uncertainty makes me cautious about making a decision on sentiment without more information."
2015-09-03,Missing,File not found
2015-09-04,Negative,"Okay, so I have to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let's start by breaking down each tweet and figuring out what they mean.

Looking at the first tweet: ""URL bobirw : out 300 $ baba at 65.49 - 1.11 : bobirw URL URL"". The user is mentioning something about investing in BABA stock, specifically targeting a price of $65.49 and selling at $300 with a loss of $1.11. The mention of ""URL"" might be a typo or irrelevant here since it's more about the tweet content than the stock.

The second tweet is confusing: ""$ spy $ aapl $ baba $ vix john welsh is short $ uvxy a real anus / lets all wish him a big fat stop out"". This seems to mix various stocks and some slang words like ""let's all wish him..."" which is definitely negative. The mention of wishing someone positive things could imply excitement or a positive sentiment, but it feels too offbeat.

Since both tweets are talking about stock prices with negative outcomes or irrelevant mentions, I can't really assess their impact on the overall stock performance. They're more about personal opinions or unrelatable advice than actual investment decisions."
2015-09-05,Missing,File not found
2015-09-06,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine if they'll impact the stock price of BABA or ALBRA, and then decide whether it's positive, neutral, or negative for each company. Let me start by looking at the first tweet: ""$ baba - adr shares end lower ; alibaba trades actively URL.""

Hmm, that one seems a bit confusing. The phrase ""ADR shares end lower"" might be a typo because ADR is typically an ETF symbol. Also, mentioning ALBRA as a company... Wait, ALBRA isn't a recognized stock on the market. Maybe it's ALABA? But even if I assume it's ALABA, that's not a real company. The tweet says ""alibaba trades actively URL."" ""URL"" usually stands for URL, which could mean something else here, maybe a typo or a play on words.

Since ALBRA isn't a known entity and the information is unclear, this tweet might be trying to influence investor sentiment without specific context. It doesn't seem to provide any actionable information that would affect the stock price directly. So perhaps it's better to consider this as a neutral statement because without concrete data or actions taken, it's hard to gauge its impact on the stock.

Next, let me look at the second tweet: ""BABA stock is expected to see a rise in dividends; the company is expanding into new markets."" This one seems more specific. It mentions an increase in dividends and expansion into new markets. Dividends are typically good for investors because they're cash payouts that can help with growth. If the company expands into new markets, it might attract more customers or opportunities, which could drive up stock prices.

So, looking at both tweets together: The first one is unclear but doesn't provide any concrete info, while the second gives some positive indicators about dividend increases and expansion. Combining these, I think the overall sentiment is positive because the company's growth potential and positive cash flow from dividends are factors that could benefit investors.

Therefore, for BABA, it's a positive trend; for ALBRA (assuming), since there's no information given, it's neutral."
2015-09-07,Missing,File not found
2015-09-08,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of BABA. Let me start by going through each tweet one by one.

The first tweet mentions movements in ""buzzing assets,"" which I think are like ETFs or funds tracking the stock market. It doesn't mention anything about the company itself, so maybe that's not relevant here.

The second tweet is from a big investor who's bullish on BABA. They're talking about pumping and dumping their stock, which can sometimes lead to higher prices if investors believe in the company.

The third tweet refers to BABA holding a group called tick URL, which might be some ETF or fund. It doesn't mention anything specific about BABA, so maybe I can ignore this one since it's too vague.

Looking at tweets 4 through 10: All of these are discussing stock market scams and financials. Scam investments can often lead to losses, especially if they're made under pressure or with misleading information.

Now, the last tweet is about BABA enhancing customer experience, which could be a positive sign for growth or increased demand.

Putting it all together, there's a mix of bullish statements from investors (tweets 2 and 10) and some speculative or potentially negative comments from others. The overall sentiment seems to lean towards uncertainty because there are both positive suggestions about BABA improving customer experience and some risky investment talk.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if the customer experience part is a sign of positive news for the stock price. More context might be needed, like specific revenue growth or product performance. Without more details, it's hard to say definitively, but considering the other tweets are all about market trends and investments, maybe the sentiment is a mix rather than entirely positive or negative.

Wait, but some of these tweets could be trying to manipulate investors. For example, when big companies make scammers, it can affect investor confidence. So if these comments are part of a larger narrative of concern, the stock might go down. But without more context about BABA's performance or other factors affecting the market, I'm not entirely sure.

Maybe the positive customer experience tweet is a bit of a fluke. It could be that it's unrelated to earnings or other key metrics. In that case, maybe the overall sentiment is neutral because there are conflicting signals from different sources.

Alternatively, if all the scammers are part of a larger pattern of bad news for BABA, then it might go negative. But again, I don't have enough info to make a strong conclusion.

I'm leaning towards a more neutral stance because while there are some positive comments about customer experience and some investor optimism, the mix of conflicting ideas makes it hard to determine a clear overall sentiment. It could be a wash."
2015-09-09,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of F Wells Fargo & Co. I'm not too familiar with all these stocks, so I'll have to take it step by step.

First, looking at each tweet individually might be complicated since there are a lot of them. Maybe I can break down each one into smaller parts or look for key words that indicate sentiment.

Starting with the first tweet: ""wfc wells fargo & co . ask size URL $ wfc $ baba $ fro $ utiw wfc stockmarket stocks."" It mentions WFC, which is Wells Fargo. The word ""ask size"" might imply that they're increasing their investments or something related to the company's performance. I'm not sure what ""fro"" stands for here, but maybe it's a typo or extra information.

Second tweet: ""AT_USER AT_USER we r diverging from china , look at $ baba vs $ spy today . theme continues at least thru tomorrow imo."" This seems like a comment from a user talking about stock prices of BABA (which I'm guessing is Wall St. Japan Abinitus, but not sure) and SPY (S&P 500). It mentions comparing BABA with SPY and talks about their theme continuing. The ""IMO"" at the end seems like an abbreviation for something, maybe a survey or poll.

Third tweet: ""ibb biotech ishares shares URL $ ibb $ baba $ xlv $ ljpc ibb invest stocks."" This mentions BIbi (if ibb is supposed to be BIbi, which might be Biogen) and shares of IBB. It seems like they're investing in BIbi.

Fourth tweet: ""alibaba group holding limited ( nyse : baba ) skyrockets on strategic alliance with metro ... - tickerlens $ baba baba URL."" The user is talking about Alibaba, which might be a big tech company, and mentions their stock price increasing. The term ""skyrocket"" suggests a significant jump.

Fifth tweet: ""rt AT_USER yahoo stock slides 4 % after co . says it may not be able to spin off alibaba shares tax free $ baba $ yhoo URL."" This is a follow-up on the fourth tweet, talking about Yahoo's stock dropping and a potential announcement about their acquisition of Alibaba without tax benefits.

Sixth tweet: ""$ yhoo $ baba : wall street : it ’ s not over for yahoo ’ s tax-free alibaba spinoff : URL."" Similar to the fifth tweet, just more context on the tax-free deal. Not sure about the sentiment here yet.

Seventh tweet: ""cala calithera biosciences , inc . tick $ cala $ uvxy $ baba $ mnkd cala finance stocks."" The word ""tick"" might mean they're increasing their shares or a new product is coming out.

Eighth tweet: ""ewy south korea ishares change URL $ ewy $ ccj $ sbin.in $ baba ewy trade ideas stocks."" Again, Ewy and SBI are names I'm not familiar with. It mentions changes in stock prices related to these companies for trading ideas.

Ninth tweet: ""video : wednesday's etf movers : $ gxc $ gdxj $ yge $ baba $ tmm.to $ cnl.to stocks URL."" This is talking about ETFs and a company called TMMO. I don't know much about them, but it might relate to the stock price.

Tenth tweet: ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . bid URL $ baba $ ttph $ dust $ itb baba nasdaq trade ideas"" mentions BABA and mentions NASDAQ for trading ideas. Not sure about sentiment yet.

Eleventh tweet: ""bidu baidu , inc . 52wk low URL $ bidu $ baba $ dhi $ pg bidu share invest."" Similar to the previous one, mentions Baidu stock being lower over a period.

Twelfth tweet: ""$ baba raised stop"" seems like they've made some significant investment or change. Maybe buying more shares? Or stopping an acquisition?

Thirteenth tweet: ""currently long $ aapl $ baba short $ fb"" says that FBL is currently holding both BABA and FB stocks, but I'm not sure about the sentiment.

Fourteenth tweet: ""rt AT_USER more on yahoo's options now that the irs won't preapprove it's alibaba spinoff . $ yhoo $ baba URL."" Another follow-up from a user talking about Yahoo's stock options becoming available after they can't claim them tax-free.

Fifteenth tweet: ""open position : $ gpro $ baba $ ua $ luv $ yelp stocks to watch : URL"" mentions GPO and YU, not sure about their impact on FBL.

Sixteenth tweet: ""rt AT_USER alibaba expects slower online sales URL $ baba"" says that Alibaba is expecting slower online sales. This could affect their stock price negatively as they might have less demand.

Now, putting it all together. The user mentions multiple companies related to BABA and other tech firms. They talk about increasing investment (like buying shares), talks about strategic alliances, changes in ETFs, etc. Also, some tweets suggest that Alibaba is facing challenges with slower online sales, which could impact their stock. Yahoo's stock price has been dropping as a result of this.

Given all these factors—increased investments, potential tax implications for Yahoo, and negative news about Alibaba—the sentiment seems mixed. There are both positive actions (investing) but also concerns about future performance due to other companies' issues."
2015-09-10,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. So, I have these tweets about a company called BABA, which is $baba on Twitter. The task is to determine whether each tweet has a positive, neutral, or negative impact on the stock price.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ baba tsai : we are a long-term bet , in better shape than a year ago URL"". Hmm, this seems pretty straightforward. It mentions that they're making a long-term bet and pointing out that their situation is better than it was a year ago. So, this sounds like good news for investors because it's showing continued confidence or stability. I think this should be a positive sentiment.

Next, the second tweet: ""$ baba - chinese president xi to meet u . s . executives during state visit"". This one talks about the Chinese President meeting U.S. executives on a state visit. That could have implications for supply chain issues because if they're meeting at a state level, maybe there's a delay or some disruption in production. But I'm not sure how direct this is without more context. It might be neutral because it's ambiguous but possibly positive since it's a major event with potential trade-offs.

Now the third tweet: ""rt AT_USER a look at what's behind alibaba's surge : pro URL $ baba $ yhoo"". This seems to be talking about Alibaba's surge, which I believe is a significant rise in their stock price. The sentiment here is positive because it's indicating growth and potential for more profits or higher valuations. So this tweet should also be positive.

Putting it all together: the first tweet boosts confidence, the second could be neutral due to ambiguity, and the third shows Alibaba growing, which is positive. Overall, the stock seems to have a positive impact across these tweets."
2015-09-11,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided some tweets about a company and is asking for an analysis on whether their stock price will go up or down based on those tweets. They’ve given specific steps to take: first, identify the target stock from each tweet, then analyze each tweet's factors as positive or negative, assess sentiment on each, and finally combine them into an overall sentiment.

Looking at the tweets, I see each one is trying to mention different aspects of a company called BABA. The words like ""baba,"" ""investing,"" ""alibaba group holding ltd."" seem important here. It seems they're discussing various news related to this company or its groups. 

In tweet 1, it mentions the group holding Ltd and talks about stock prices on different exchanges—like $baba$, $nasdaq$, etc. That probably affects investor sentiment. Tweets like 4 and 8 mention investing and stock performances, which are direct indicators of market reactions.

Tweets from BABA’s own employees might suggest a certain level of engagement or trust in their management, but I’m not sure if that's positive or negative on the stock. However, since all these tweets are about BABA related news, they could be contributing to some investor interest.

There are no clear warnings or bad information here; it seems more like a mix of informative posts. The sentiment varies between positive, neutral, and negative, but without explicit words that indicate strong up or down movements, it's hard to assign a single overall score."
2015-09-12,Negative,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of BABA company. Let's go through each tweet one by one.

First, looking at the target stock symbol ""baba"". The problem is asking me to determine if its stock price will be positive, neutral, or negative based on these tweets. I remember from the previous example that a similar approach was taken where each tweet was broken down into factors and sentiment evaluated.

Alright, let's start with the first tweet: ""$ baba vs . $ bidu head to head URL URL"". Hmm, this seems like a comparison between BABA and another stock, BUD. The language here is about a comparison and mentions falling or rising in value. But I'm not sure if that gives any indication of the stock's overall direction.

Next tweet: ""$ baba remains in a downtrend . i could see it breaking out here & mean reverting a bit , but lt a lot of work to do . URL"". This seems to analyze BABA's current trend and mentions potential breakdown or mean reversion, which can affect investor sentiment. It also hints at some effort needed.

Third tweet: ""rt AT_USER barron ’ s just absolutely savaged $ baba this morning alibaba : why it could fall 50 % further URL"". Here, the mention of a significant drop and future potential decrease makes me think BABA is expected to be more volatile or lower. This seems like a negative outlook.

Fourth tweet: ""i guess all we need is for gartman to go short , and $ baba will crack $ 150 next week . URL"". This directly mentions that if GARTMAN decides to short, the stock might reach $150. Shorting can lead investors to take profits, potentially lowering prices or causing a sharp decline.

Fifth tweet: ""zozotrader : $ baba alibaba : why it could fall 50 % further : zozotrader URL URL"". Similar language as the third one about expected volatility and possible falls. Again, this seems to indicate BABA might be more volatile than anticipated.

Sixth tweet: ""myec national instruments corp . investor opinions URL $ myec $ xiv $ baba $ fb myec stockmarket share"". This looks like a news article or opinion piece from investor sources about BABA's performance. It could either support or contradict the overall market sentiment, but without more details, it's hard to tell.

Seventh tweet: ""rt AT_USER barrons write-up on $ baba is good . so many cockroaches , so little time . sounds like a scam to me . URL"". This comment from a broker seems critical. He calls BABA a scam and mentions cockroaches (which might be a playful term). This directly targets the stock as risky or manipulative, which would likely lead to negative sentiment.

Now, combining these thoughts: The third tweet is very negative about BABA's potential fall by 50%. The fourth and fifth tweets add more concern that shorting GARTMAN could drive it down. The seventh tweet takes a harsher view altogether, labeling it a scam. These factors all point towards a likely negative impact.

I should consider if any of these are contradictory or reinforcing each other. For example, the broker's critique aligns with both the possibility of BABA falling (from the third tweet) and the direct mention in the fourth about shorting GARTMAN to reach $150. 

Additionally, the article from myec seems less specific but could be an update on their stock performance, which might not directly address BABA's position.

Overall, despite some mixed signs, the most significant and direct threat is the potential for BABA to fall by 50%, especially given the broker's negative outlook. This makes me lean towards a Negative overall sentiment."
2015-09-13,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on BABA stock. So, first I need to look at each tweet individually and see what they're saying.

The first tweet is ""rt AT_USER barron's on $ baba - wow : ' baba claims 367m users — about the same as one government's estimate of china ’ s entire online - …"". Okay, so AT_USER is mentioning something about the number of users for BABA. They're talking about 367 million users compared to a government's estimate of China's entire online presence. That seems like some serious data or maybe an analysis.

Now, I'm not sure if that directly relates to stock performance. It might be more about business metrics or research. If the tweet is sharing information about the company's user base, it could influence investor sentiment positively because high user numbers often indicate strong growth potential. But without knowing how these users are being used (e.g., sales, revenue, competitive advantage), it's hard to tell if it's positive news.

The second tweet is ""rt AT_USER baba up $216 on Q4"". This seems straightforward. It mentions that BABA has gone up by $216 in the past quarter. If that's a significant increase, it might suggest growth and could be a positive indicator for investors. But again, unless this news comes from a reputable source or there are additional context like revenue growth or positive news about the company, it's hard to assess the sentiment definitively.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think in terms of stock indicators. High user numbers could be seen as more investors interested in the company's online presence, which might translate into increased demand for their products or services. Revenue growth is another factor—more users probably mean more revenue potential.

However, without knowing whether these tweets are from a trusted source or if they're just speculative ideas, it's risky to take a hard stance. I should consider that each tweet could be independent and maybe influenced by different factors. So, combining the information from both tweets might not give a clear picture of the overall impact on BABA.

Since neither tweet seems to provide concrete data supporting or against the stock performance, my best guess is that they're more about business metrics than sentiment indicators. Therefore, it's probably [Neutral] because without concrete evidence, it's hard to say if there's any positive or negative influence."
2015-09-14,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on $ baba's stock price. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

First, tweet 1 mentions an accounting scandal from 2015 but doesn't specify if it's positive or negative for the company. It's a bit vague, so I'll leave that as unclear.

Tweets 2 and 3 talk about shorting $ baba and mention brokers who can provide broker names. This is more of a transaction advice rather than an opinion on stock performance.

Tweet 4 talks about booking profits today with put options and calls for stocks like $ nflx, $lnkd, etc., which are related but not directly about $ baba. It seems a bit off topic.

Tweets 5 mentions a maniacal trader calling out $ baba due to its low price relative to expectations. This shows a negative outlook or disappointment with the stock's performance.

Tweet 6 discusses Alibaba having over 367 million users, similar to China's online shopping population. This could indicate growth potential but doesn't directly relate to $ baba.

Tweets 7 and 8 predict that $ baba will be near its August 24 low as a double bottom. If this is expected, it might signal overvaluation or support for the stock, contributing to positive sentiment.

Tweets 9 predicts a barrier from Barron's due to $ baba's performance, which could affect investor confidence and push towards higher prices.

Tweet 10 talks about stock performance after sales targets, fears of the stock, acquisitions like $ shl taking over. It shows both support for growth and potential risks, which might be mixed but leaning positive.

Lastly, tweet 11 refers to $ baba's status from Nov 2014, saying it ""nailed it."" While not specific about performance, this could indicate recent gains or changes in the market.

Putting it all together, tweets show a mix of negative outlooks (tweets 5, 9) and some positive expectations (tweets 8, 10). However, they don't provide concrete data on trends or current conditions, making it hard to determine a clear overall trend. Therefore, the sentiment is probably neutral."
2015-09-15,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative for BABA's stock. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet mentions rate hikes making people gaga and suggests listening to Najarian's music for $150. That seems like a positive action because if the company is doing something that makes investors happy, it could boost the stock. But I'm not sure about the exact impact yet.

2. The second tweet talks about BABA holding LIT, which probably refers to stocks traded onideas. It mentions prices and the P/E ratio but doesn't provide specific info. Since it's a stock name, maybe this is just information without sentiment cues.

3. The third tweet links SCC trade ideas and mentions a 52-week high. Again, not much about sentiment here—just a price action hint.

4. Fourth tweet lists AP, FB, SPY, BABA as companies with farley nervousness. That's more of a comment from someone, possibly on Twitter, indicating that the company is under some tension or negative news. This could lead to a positive or neutral sentiment based on context.

5. Fifth tweet mentions bobirw shorting at 62.28 and says it's for $BABA stock. It's speculative but doesn't state if it's going up or down, so maybe not strong enough for the overall sentiment.

6. Sixth tweet talks about a year anniversary of BABA's pricing change by 34%. This seems like a positive event—maybe indicating potential buybacks could be selling off, which might affect stock price. So this is a positive indicator.

7. Seventh tweet lists several tech stocks with $BABA included. It doesn't mention sentiment or anything else except that it's part of a broader tech sector. Not enough info to decide yet.

8. Eighth tweet says BABA is testing above the 65 level, just about an hour before session ends. That suggests potential selling pressure as prices near a support level. This could lead to a negative or neutral sentiment depending on if buyers are coming in.

9. Ninth tweet mentions BABA being part of multiple stocks in tech and other sectors. Not enough information—just categorizing it into sectors, so no clear positive or negative yet.

10. Tenth tweet says BABA is expected to drop 50% but doesn't buy here, suggesting some uncertainty. This could cause a mixed sentiment as people might remain cautious despite the possible move.

Putting this all together: There's one positive event (squeeze over $64 and short selling) and an indicator of potential sell pressure near a support level. However, other tweets suggest some uncertainty or negative news from farley nervousness in other companies. The overall sentiment isn't clear but leaning towards neutral because while there are positive signs, significant events could lead to mixed feelings."
2015-09-16,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze the given tweets to determine their likely impact on the future stock price of a company. The user provided two tweets and wants me to assess each based on whether they're positive, neutral, or negative.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER on its ipo-day alibaba's market cap was $ 230 billion . today , it's $ 160b . here's the downtrend $ baba needs to break : URL"". So, this tweet is from a user and mentions that Alibaba's market cap dropped from $230B to $160B. It uses the hashtag #BABA, which indicates support for the stock. The sentiment seems positive because it's talking about a potential drop in market capitalization but also notes an impending IPO. The mention of the stock being supported suggests that investors are cautious but not completely negative.

Now, the second tweet: ""rt AT_USER alibaba ha perdido 70.000 millones de dólares de capitalización bursátil desde su debut . $ baba"". This one also uses #BABA and mentions a significant drop of 70 million dollars in Bursátil from its initial launch. Similar to the first tweet, it's talking about a potential decline but again highlights the stock's support. The use of ""perdido"" (loss) adds to the negative sentiment here, suggesting that some investors are worried about the company's performance.

Putting these together: both tweets express concerns about Alibaba's growth and market position, which can be interpreted as a negative sentiment from an investor perspective. However, they also mention support, indicating that not all investors are equally affected. It seems like there's some tension but no clear overall positive outlook for the stock.

So, combining the two tweets, I think the overall sentiment is leaning towards [Negative] because both tweets highlight potential problems with Alibaba that could impact its stock price negatively."
2015-09-17,Missing,File not found
2015-09-18,Missing,File not found
2015-09-19,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the future stock price of a given company. Let's see, the target stock symbol isn't provided yet, but looking at the tweets, they all mention strategies like strangles and options calls for companies like spy, aapl, fb, baba, etc. These are investment vehicles that can be part of a portfolio.

Looking at the first few tweets (1 to 20), they're repeating similar phrases: ""rt AT_USER all strangles and options calls posted on URL working out very well $ spy $ aapl $ fb $ baba $ nke $ hd $ ba $ ind …"" They seem to be in quotes, but it's hard to tell if that means positive or negative. The next tweet (21) is the same as 1-20 again.

These tweets are all in a repeated format, which might indicate that they're just copy-pasting the previous ones or perhaps using some kind of trending trend analysis on social media. Options trading strategies can fluctuate and sometimes be seen as volatile investments. They don't necessarily have a consistent positive or negative connotation because they involve risk and uncertainty.

Since these are tweets analyzing the performance of several stocks, it's more about investor sentiment on these strategies than predicting future stock prices directly. Investors might buy into these strategies if they think they could go viral or if there's a trend, but that doesn't mean the overall company will perform well. The tweets don't specify any specific positive indicators related to the companies, and they're all in a repeating format which might not provide any new information.

So, given that they are just listing out various investment strategies without providing any actual analysis or predictions about the companies' performance, I think the sentiment here is neutral. They don't seem to be reinforcing a positive outlook on any specific stock or predicting a negative outcome."
2015-09-20,Positive,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about the stock price for [BABA] or other companies.

First, I need to extract each tweet and identify if it's positive, negative, or neutral. Each tweet either says ""rt"" at the beginning, which probably indicates support or a statement about the stock.

Looking at the first few tweets:

1. ""rt AT_USER set alerts on $ ngcg top stocks update URL / URL via ngcg $ baba $ pg …""
2. Similarly, several of these have similar content about setting alerts and updating URLs for other stocks like BABA.

There are a lot of [rt AT_USER] tweets repeated multiple times. These likely indicate that the user is monitoring or tracking the stock, so this would be a positive sign. It suggests confidence in the stock's value or potential performance.

Now looking at the next set:

32. "" $ baba $ fxi $ spy black swan anyone ? URL""

This one has some keywords: BABA, FFXI, SPY (which is SPY, another ETF related to BABA), Black Swans, and questions about whether anyone is involved with it. The mention of ""Black Swans"" in the stock names makes me think that there's a lot of hype or potential growth. The question at the end seems like an inquiry but doesn't have clear positive or negative sentiment.

Moving on:

33-35: Similar to tweet 32, multiple mentions of BABA with different ETFs and terms, followed by more ""rt"" tweets.

Then tweet 36-40 are all [rt AT_USER set alerts...] which again reinforces the idea that the user is monitoring, showing active involvement. This positive activity would likely translate into a positive impact on stock price.

Tweets 41-42 mention ""takedown URL,"" which implies removing something, but without more context, it's hard to tell if this is positive or negative. It might mean selling the stock or moving away from it, but since all previous tweets were monitoring and setting alerts, this could be a neutral or even slightly negative action.

But in the overall sentiment summary, I think the most important points are the frequent ""rt AT_USER"" statements. These indicate that users are actively tracking the stock, which is generally positive because it shows confidence and determination to invest. Without specific signs of positive news (like earnings reports, new launches, etc.), but based on the majority of tweets being monitoring and set alerts, this suggests a steady outlook.

So putting it all together: The overall sentiment should be positive because there are consistent mentions of alerting users about stock movements, indicating confidence and an active approach. Even though some tweets might suggest speculative ideas or potential risks (like BABA involved in something big), the primary trend is upward movement based on user activity."
2015-09-21,Positive,"Okay, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of a company. The user has given me a list of tweets and wants me to determine if each is positive, neutral, or negative. Then, I need to summarize them into one line with [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative].

First, I'll start by reading through all the tweets carefully. Each tweet seems to be about stock updates for BABA (formerly known as BNS) or related companies.

Starting with the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER AT_USER set alerts on $ ngcg top stocks update URL / URL via ngcg $ baba $ pg …"". It looks like they're setting alerts and updating their URLs. That sounds like positive because it's about monitoring stocks, so I'll mark this as Positive.

Next is another one with the same content: ""rt AT_USER set alerts on $ ngcg top stocks update URL / URL via ngcg $ baba $ pg …"". Again, similar structure, same meaning, so another Positive. Maybe I should check if there's a pattern here, but it seems consistent.

Now comes tweet 3: ""how do you pronounce barron's ? does it rhyme with ' morons ' ? $ fb $ baba $ gpro"". This is more about the pronunciation of words and possibly unrelated to stock info. It doesn't seem positive or negative, so probably Neutral.

Tweets 4 to 10 all have similar content: ""rt AT_USER set alerts on $ ngcg top stocks update URL / URL via ngcg $ baba $ pg …"". Each is setting alerts for BABA's stocks. This is consistent Positive behavior, so multiple Positives.

Then tweet 12 mentions a change in expectations and updates the URL for $ baba. That sounds like updating stock information, which could be positive because it shows interest or engagement with the company. So, another Positive.

Tweet 13 is similar to others, just setting alerts again. It seems consistent.

Tweets 14-20 also set alerts about BABA and related stocks. They mention things like ties-up with companies or technical indicators without specific positive statements. So, maybe this is a mix of both, but mostly Positive.

Finally, tweet 23 talks about tying up a deal with LIFT for O2O platforms. That's a positive action because it's expanding the company's operations, which could support future performance. So, another Positive.

Wait, but I need to make sure there are no negative tweets here. None seem to have any negative sentiments or warnings. All are positive in their actions. So overall sentiment is still Positive.

I think all these tweets are indicating a focus on stock-related activities and updates, which generally suggest investor interest. So the overall impact should be positive."
2015-09-22,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock from each tweet. The main word that stands out is ""baba,"" which seems familiar to some investors. For now, I'll assume it's ""BABA"" since that's a common symbol for energy companies, though I might double-check later.

Now, looking at each tweet:

1. ""ace comedian ali baba blasted osun state governor , ogbeni rauf aregesola URL $ baba"" – This seems like a link or mention of something related to BABA, possibly a stock price update. The word ""baba"" is repeated here, so it's likely an update on their stock performance.

2. ""$ baba : analyst action by mkm partners on alibaba group holding : URL URL"" – Here, the analyst from MKM Partners is mentioned as acting on Alibaba Group's holdings. This could indicate that BABA is a stock they're analyzing or about to act on.

3. ""amazon : finding a fit in hardware URL $ aapl apple $ baba $ bby $ ebay $ amzn"" – The word ""baba"" appears here too, along with other company names like Apple (AAPL), Amazon, and others. This might suggest that the tweet is about stock valuations or company news related to these companies.

4. ""our stock picks have been seeing monstrous growth ! see our new picks early : URL $ segi $ baba $ swet"" – Again, ""baba"" is present here as well. The mention of stock picks being ""monstrous growth"" could indicate that BABA has seen significant gains, which might be positive.

Now, I'll assess each tweet's sentiment. The first tweet mentions a link related to BABA and the word ""baba."" While it doesn't explicitly state a purchase or action, the repetition suggests a potential buyer interest. The second tweet is more about MKM Partners' actions on Alibaba, which might indicate they're interested in BABA. The third tweet points to hardware companies, but again, with ""baba,"" it's likely related to BABA. The fourth tweet specifically mentions stock picks growing and refers to BABA, suggesting a positive outlook.

Putting it all together, each tweet is pointing towards BABA having positive growth or interest. However, since the user only provides these tweets without context, I can't be certain about their full impact. But collectively, the mention of growth suggests a positive sentiment."
2015-09-23,Neutral,"Alright, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine their likely impact on the future stock price of a company. The user provided some tweets and asked me to evaluate them. Let's go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the target stock mentioned in the tweets. I notice that several tweets mention Tencent (TCL), including ""tencent m & a chief said to leave after $19 billion in deals."" This seems relevant because TCL is a major tech company, possibly one of the companies in the list. 

Next, each tweet has factors and assessments. For example, the first tweet talks about TCL leaving after big deals but notes that there's still uncertainty from recent tech events. The second tweet mentions Jack Ma losing $2.7 billion on Tuesday due to a 3% drop in BABA (Bioline), which is closely held by Ma. His being the 27th richest person could affect investor sentiment.

The third tweet discusses someone living with Bill Gates, suggesting a cultural reference but not directly about TCL. Fourth talks about bidding for something related to BAT, which might be a different company. Fifth mentions Marissa Mayer's fate regarding YHOO and BABA, possibly unrelated. 

Sixth refers to BABA looking bad daily, possibly affecting the stock price. Seventh is about BABA holding an ALG group with a day low, which could imply a lack of interest or growth. Eighth discusses gold trust shares for GLD and others related to TSLA (Tech Street Capital), which could impact tech stocks.

Each tweet's analysis needs to identify positive and negative factors, assess sentiment, then combine the overall opinion. For example, the first tweet has both positive (TCL leaving) and negative (uncertainty about BABA). Second tweet is more negative due to Ma's loss but also positive because of his wealth status. Third is neutral with no clear focus on TCL. Fourth: no mention of TCL. Fifth: unrelated tweets. Sixth: possible negative if BABA is a tech stock, but depends on the company. Seventh: possibly neutral as no specific company is mentioned beyond BABA. Eighth: could be positive or negative depending on TSLA's performance.

After evaluating each tweet, I need to summarize the overall sentiment towards TCL. Positive tweets might suggest support from fans or experts, while negatives from uncertain events or poor news. But without knowing exactly what those tweets are about, it's a bit tricky. However, considering the focus on BABA and its performance, which is often associated with tech stocks, the impact could be positive if investors expect growth. But given uncertainty, especially with BABA being held by a wealthy individual, that could lead to negative sentiment."
2015-09-24,Negative,"Alright, let me figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price. I see five tweets here, each mentioning different stocks or companies. My goal is to evaluate each tweet based on their factors—positive or negative—and then overall sentiment.

Starting with the first tweet: ""psx phillips 66 company info URL $ psx $ baba $ xhb $ smn psx pennystocks nasdaq."" Hmm, this looks like a stock name. The words ""phillips"" might refer to Phil Poon's work or perhaps an event related to his research. The structure is confusing with $ signs and URLs, but the main part seems like a stock symbol being mentioned: pennystocks. So, it's pointing towards a specific stock.

The second tweet: ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . prev close URL $ baba $ mu $ tsla $ wmt baba share investing."" This looks more familiar. BABA is a known cryptocurrency and stock, so this must be referring to BABA. The mention of ""prev close"" might indicate that it's the previous day's price or some sort of news about its performance.

Third tweet: ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . prev close URL $ baba $ mu $ tsla $ wmt baba share investing."" Similar to the second, this is likely BABA as well. The focus here seems on whether it went up or down from previous close.

Fourth tweet: ""cew wisdom tree dreyfus emerging currency fund exchange URL $ cew $ jnk $ baba $ mdlz cew stock stocks."" This looks like a financial article or report, possibly about BABA since it's the name. It could be discussing economic trends or company performance relevant to BABA.

Fifth tweet: ""fb facebook , inc . ask size URL $ fb $ baba $ adbe $ uso fb share tradeideas."" FB is Facebook's stock symbol. This might be a call for investment advice or analysis on Facebook's performance related to BABA.

Now, evaluating each tweet:
1. First tweet: Not very clear, but seems like a stock name. I don't have enough info about pennystocks.
2. Second and third tweets both mention BABA. If the previous close indicates a trend, it could be an up or down move. But without specific data, hard to say.
3. Fourth tweet is talking about a report on BABA, which might suggest some investment analysis but not direct stock price movement.
4. Fifth tweet mentions FB, so maybe looking at Facebook's performance relative to BABA.

Overall, there are several tweets about BABA and other stocks. If these are related to market trends or news that affects BABA's performance, the sentiment could be positive if the stock goes up, negative if it goes down, or neutral if there's no significant movement."
2015-09-25,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user has given me a set of tweets and asked me to determine their likely impact on the stock price of a company based on my analysis. Hmm, okay.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking through the tweets, it seems that some mention ""baba"" which is a well-known stock symbol for iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Correspondence Fund. That must be the company in question here.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one and extract relevant factors. For each tweet, I should separate the positive (Buy or Buy/Sell) and negative (Sell or Sell/Discount) factors. Then, assess how each tweet might influence investor sentiment based on these factors. Finally, combine all this information to get an overall sentiment.

Starting with the first tweet: ""utx united technologies corp . short sales URL $ utx $ gm $ zivo $ baba utx $ nasdaq finance."" It mentions short sales and specific stock prices, but not much else. Maybe it's neutral because it doesn't give a clear outlook on the company's performance.

Second tweet: ""baba bank of america corp . shares URL $ baba $ beav $ ewg $ fnma baba invest stock."" This one clearly lists investments from BABA. It shows ownership in banks, which is a positive sign for investor confidence.

Third tweet: ""spxl direxion daily s & p 500 bull 3x shares exchange URL $ spxl $ nem $ bx $ baba spxl finance stockmarketsune …"" This mentions the S&P 500 being bullish and BABA's investment in it. It seems like a positive signal from the market, which is good for BABA.

Fourth tweet: ""analyst 9035 gave $ baba a sell rating URL."" This directly gives a negative rating to BABA, so that should have a significant impact reducing investor confidence.

Fifth tweet: ""$ wynn stock price updated thursday , september 24 , 2015 7:11 : 04 pm $ baba $ lly $ hyg $ erx URL."" It's about the stock price update for WYNN, but not related to BABA. Maybe it's a different company or unrelated information. Not sure yet.

Sixth tweet: ""$ drys dry ships inc . 52wk low URL $ drys $ baba $ eum $ ugaz drys pennystocks stockmarket."" This mentions Drys, which is an agriculture company, but again, not related to BABA.

Seventh tweet: ""usat usa technologies , inc . stock message board URL $ usat $ baba $ srx . v $ smh usat investing investuso united …"" Similar pattern here; USAT's stock and investment info, no mention of BABA. So probably unrelated.

Now, putting it all together: The first tweet is neutral, the second positive, third positive (based on market bullishness), fourth negative because of a sell rating, fifth possibly unrelated but still affecting the market. 

Wait, but in my initial analysis, I only considered the tweets that are directly related to BABA. The others might be irrelevant unless they have a direct impact.

The overall sentiment seems mixed: some positive, some negative. But let's see: two positive tweets, one neutral, and two negative. It's not overwhelmingly positive or negative. However, with four factors—two positive, two negative—the market is divided but perhaps leaning towards uncertainty.

But since the user wants a single conclusion of [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. If I combine all factors, considering both positive and negative, it might be neutral because there's an imbalance between buying and selling signals. Plus, the fifth tweet could have more weight on the market, but without specific info, it's hard to tell.

Wait, no, in my initial analysis, only two tweets were directly about BABA: second and third. The others are unrelated. So perhaps I should consider them as neutral or maybe not at all?

Hmm, this is tricky because some tweets might be irrelevant. If I include only the ones directly related, that's better. But since the user provided multiple tweets, including more unrelated ones, it's a bit ambiguous.

But looking back, in my initial response, I considered the positive and negative factors from all relevant tweets, but actually, most are about other companies or unrelated topics. So perhaps I should focus on the BABA-related tweets only.

From that, two positives (buy) and one negative (sell). But another tweet mentions WYNN which is a different company, maybe affecting market? Not sure.

Wait, maybe the fifth tweet is actually about stock price changes, but without context on how it affects BABA. It might not be relevant unless there's a significant impact.

In any case, I think with two buys and one sell, combined with other information, it leans towards neutral because there's an imbalance in opinions. So I'll go with Neutral."
2015-09-26,Neutral,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to analyze the impact of some tweets on the stock price of a company and then determine if it's Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the tweets:

1. The first tweet mentions $ baba technical analysis video, but since it's about a video, maybe the stock isn't clearly identified here.
2. The second tweet talks about watching a swing-long trigger for BABA over 60.80 and looking for day trading opportunities. This seems like a specific event that could influence investor sentiment positively.
3. The third tweet lists several stock symbols: ATVI, Activision Blizzard, etc., but doesn't specify the target stock.
4. The fourth tweet mentions a stock alert on GEQU up 1757 for platinum members and invites subscriptions. Again, no clear target symbol.
5. The fifth tweet discusses ALV Autoliv's day high stock prices.

Now, focusing on tweets 2, 3, 4, and 5 to find the target stock symbols:

- From tweet 2: $60.80 (BABA) seems relevant.
- From tweet 3: Not sure, but maybe ATVI isn't the target.
- From tweet 4: No target given; perhaps it's a typo or not related.
- From tweet 5: ""ALV Autoliv,"" which might be AGLV. But without knowing ALV, I can't determine the stock.

So, assuming the primary target is BABA at $60.80. Now, evaluating each relevant tweet:

1. The first tweet isn't directly about a stock but a video. It mentions a date and URL, so maybe it's about news related to BABA?
2. The second tweet talks about a swing-long strategy for BABA over $60.80. This could indicate confidence or an event that might drive prices.
3. The third tweet lists ATVI, which I don't know the stock. It mentions ex-div dates and URLs; not directly related to BABA.
4. The fourth tweet talks about a subscription service but no target.
5. The fifth tweet is about AGLV's high stock price, so again, maybe related to another stock.

Assuming the primary influence comes from the second tweet regarding BABA at $60.80. However, without knowing if this event will go up or down, it's hard to assess the overall sentiment. But since there are mentions of a swing strategy over a certain price point, which could affect buying interest.

So, I think the positive factors might push the stock higher but not enough to determine the overall impact definitively."
2015-09-27,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. The user has provided a list of nine tweets and wants me to analyze their effects.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking through them, it seems that all the tweets mention ""pennystocks"" multiple times. So, the target stock is pennystocks.com or similar.

Now, for each tweet, I should identify positive and negative factors. Let me go one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions emerging markets, bearish sentiment, shares at 3x valuations, and URLs pointing to different platforms. This seems like bearish news.
2. The second tweet talks about BABA (Baba) stock, investments in stocks, dividend info, and financials. Positive factors include investment interest and dividend info.
3. Third tweet mentions myec, tick, inc., earnings call, price target at $50, and URLs to other platforms. Positive points are earnings announcement and price targeting.
4. Fourth tweet is about BABA, dividends, and NASDAQ stock. Positive factors are dividend news and stock market presence.
5. Fifth tweet discusses Citi, financials, TSLA (tesla), cop (cop) for stock info. Positive here are financial health and stock performance expectations.
6. Sixth tweet mentions FINL (finline), e-p-s, BABA. Positive: company name and share details.
7. Seventh tweet talks about RSPG (rspg), futures, ETFs. Positive: stock index exposure and investment ideas.
8. Eighth tweet is about SBB, a short position in smallcap stocks. Positive: dividend and invest information.
9. Ninth tweet discusses ISHARES, silver trust, finance, and investment. Positive: silver and financials.

Next, I need to assess the sentiment for each tweet. Positive tweets contribute positively to investor sentiment, while negative ones lower it. Here's my analysis:

1. Bearish on emerging markets: Negative.
2. Positive: Investment in stocks, dividend info: Positive.
3. Positive: Price target, earnings announcement: Positive.
4. Positive: Dividend news, NASDAQ presence: Positive.
5. Positive: Financial health, stock performance expectations: Positive.
6. Positive: Company name, share details: Positive.
7. Positive: Stock index exposure, investment ideas: Positive.
8. Positive: Dividend info, smallcap invest: Positive.
9. Positive: Silver trust, financials: Positive.

Now, tallying up each tweet's impact:

- 3 positive tweets (2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9). Wait, let me count again:
   - Tweets 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 are all positive. That's eight positive tweets.
   - Tweet 1 is negative.

So, 8 positive and 1 negative tweet. Positive impact seems strong because even with one negative, the overall sentiment leans towards positive.

Therefore, the overall sentiment for pennystocks should be [Positive]."
2015-09-28,Neutral,"Alright, I need to figure out how each tweet impacts the stock price for BABA. Let's take it step by step.

First, I'll extract the target stock symbol from the tweets. It looks like some tweets mention ""baba"" in their messages, so I'll focus on those as they are likely related to BABA or companies with similar names that might be indirectly affected.

Looking at each tweet:

1. The first tweet mentions BABA and some URLs about stock prices.
2. The second tweet talks about AT_USER's opinion on options volume but includes various stocks listed in quotes, which include BABA as part of the list.
3. The third tweet again mentions BABA with some investment quotes.
4. The fourth tweet discusses Fitbit and other companies but doesn't mention BABA specifically.
5. The fifth tweet focuses on a few tech stocks but again doesn't highlight BABA.
6. The sixth tweet about CMCSA, which isn't related to BABA.
7. The seventh tweet mentions Brazil's ISHARES group but includes BABA as one of the stocks listed.
8. The eighth tweet talks about KMI and kinder morgan with a forum reference for investing.

From this, I can see that tweets 1, 2, 3, 7 are discussing BABA or companies that might be correlated. Each mentions BABA in some capacity, but none of the other tweets specifically focus on BABA. 

Next, I'll analyze each tweet for positive, negative, or neutral factors.

1. The first tweet's URL mentions stock prices and BABA being high.
2. The second tweet includes BABA in its stock quote list.
3. The third tweet has BABA listed with some investment quotes.
4. The fourth tweet doesn't mention BABA except as part of the options volume list, but I don't see any positive or negative sentiment expressed here.
5. The fifth tweet is about tech stocks and again mentions BABA in stock names but no explicit sentiment.
6. CMCSA's change from $cmcsa to $cpst might indicate a move towards more dollars (which could mean lower prices), which would be negative for BABA if they are inversely related, though not directly mentioned.
7. The tweet about ISHARES mentions BABA but doesn't provide sentiment indicators.
8. KMI and kinder morgan's forum posts don't mention stock performance.

Considering the positive tweets (1-3) where BABA is listed or discussed, there's a collective positive trend. However, some neutral tweets are present, which might balance out any negative aspects. The overall impact isn't clear-cut because while positive mentions are there, other factors like market conditions, company fundamentals, or macroeconomic indicators could also influence the stock price.

Given that BABA is involved in multiple positive tweets but no significant negative ones, I'm leaning towards a positive sentiment. However, since some tweets don't express explicit sentiment beyond mentioning BABA, it's hard to be certain. The presence of multiple mentions and mixed positives and neutrals makes the overall assessment uncertain."
2015-09-29,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of a company based on the provided information. The user has given 10 tweets, each discussing different topics related to tech and financial products.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the tweets, I see that none of them directly mention the same stock unless it's implied by other terms. For example, ""fnma"" is mentioned in several tweets but doesn't specify which company, so maybe I should focus on the most relevant part or assume a common abbreviation.

Next, for each tweet, I need to identify Positive and Negative factors. This might involve parsing keywords related to the stock. However, some tweets use terms like "" spinoff,"" ""bull 3x shares,"" ""dividend,"" etc., which are more about market trends rather than specific stock performance.

I'll start by going through each tweet one by one:

1. ""fnma federal national mortgage change URL $ fnma $ hyg $ baba $ erx fnma tradeideas stockmarket"" - I think the key here is 'fnma,' which likely refers to Wells Fargo & Company (Wells Fargo). 

2. ""news yahoo to pursue alibaba stake spinoff without irs ruling URL $ baba $ yhoo"" - This seems to be about their efforts to acquire BABA stock, avoiding the IRS ruling.

3. Similar to tweet 2, but with an RT. It's still about pursuing a stake acquisition.

4. ""rt AT_USER alibaba-ийн хувьцааны ханш ipo-ийн үеийн түүхэн дээд ханшаасаа хоёр дахин бага үнээр арилжигдлаа . $ baba $ yhoo"" - Again, about acquiring BABA.

5. ""hcti has gained 172.22 % for our subscribers , in the past 3 weeks ! major update : URL $ segi $ baba $ swet"" - This seems to be a positive news regarding HCTI's stock performance.

6. ""tmf direxion daily 20 year plus treasury bull 3x shares filings URL $ tmf $ amba $ gpro $ baba tmf stock tradeideas"" - TMF is another company mentioned here, focusing on their financials and stock performance.

7. ""agi alamos gold inc . ideas URL $ agi $ nflx $ gdx $ baba agi nasdaq pennystocks"" - AGI's involvement in gold products and stock options.

8. "" dbc db commodities tracking index fund dividend URL $ dbc $ cm.to $ baba $ gpro dbc nasdaq stockmarket"" - DBC's investment in a commodities fund and dividend payments.

9. ""fcnxx fidelity contra fund quotes URL $ fcntx $ abx $ aa $ baba fcntx stock tradeideasfcx freeport-mcmoran , inc .…"" - FCTX's performance of their mutual fund.

10. ""yahoo stock on the rebound ; final chapter of alibaba spinoff still to come : URL china $ yhoo $ baba"" - Focuses on YHOO's recovery and anticipation for a potential spin-off in China.

Now, summarizing each tweet:

- Tweets 2,3,5: Mentioned BABA (Wells Fargo & Company) about pursuing their stake acquisition.
- Tweet 6: TMF with positive stock performance data.
- Tweets 7,8,9: AGI involved with gold and DBC's commodities fund.
- Tweet 10: Focus on YHOO's financial recovery in China.

Considering the factors, tweets 2,3,5,6,10 are all about acquiring BABA or TMF. Each of these could be positive signs if the acquisition is successful. However, tweets 7 and 8 involve AGI (Alamos Gold) which may indicate interest but without specifics on their performance. Tweet 9 talks about FCTX's funds.

The overall sentiment seems to be a mix of acquisition-related news, which typically can signal growth or positive outcomes for the company. But without knowing more details about each acquisition, it's hard to say if these are positives or just neutral.

Considering all that, I think this is a mixed signal. It could go either way depending on how successful the acquisitions are."
2015-09-30,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets and figure out if they're positive, neutral, or negative for the stock price impact. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

First tweet mentions acol acology, which is in the financials sector. It has short sales involved, but it's not clear what that means for investors. Maybe it indicates some risk aversion but no immediate buy-up from the company itself.

Second tweet talks about baba alibaba group. They're doing premium research and seem to be trading their stock. That sounds like a big move by a significant company, which could drive up prices.

Third tweet is about defeat devices. It doesn't specify if that's positive or negative for the company, but it seems out of context since it doesn't relate directly to the stock in question.

Fourth tweet mentions trade alerts and premium research on top stocks, suggesting they're active in stock trading activities. This could mean buying more shares, which would be positive for the stock price.

Fifth tweet talks about YHOO IPOs and businesstrends. If YHOO is going public or expanding, that's a sign of growth, so this could be positive.

Sixth tweet mentions YHOO up 2%, deciding to ""venture into"", which might mean they're entering new areas but not necessarily buying shares immediately.

Seventh tweet says baba shares mixed. It doesn't specify the direction, just that something is active, so maybe no clear signal on sentiment.

Eighth tweet lists a variety of stocks, including baba, over 2000% gains in three months. This looks like a big buy wave.

Ninth tweet mentions their winning picks went up 2000%. If they're expanding into new tech or products, that's positive news for the stock price.

Putting it all together: There are both positive and negative tweets. Some mention baba getting premium research and trading, others talk about YHOO going public. The overall picture is a mix of buying activities and potential growth. So I think it leans towards [Neutral], because while there's some buy intent, the information isn't overwhelmingly strong."
2015-10-01,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to determine the impact on the stock price of the given company based on these tweets. So, first, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at them, I see some mentions like 'baba', 'gbsn', 'bzna', and others with 'baba' in their names. It seems like 'baba' is a common stock ticker symbol, so maybe that's the one we're focusing on.

Now, each tweet talks about market movements related to China manufacturing contraction and gold miners. Let me go through them one by one.

The first tweet says "" Alibaba $ baba stock sliding on china manufacturing contraction URL"". Alibaba is known for tech companies, but the mention of China manufacturing contraction could indicate economic factors affecting the industry overall, which might have a broader impact. If manufacturing contracts are bad, it could affect multiple sectors, so maybe this is a negative factor.

The second tweet's title mentions gold miners bidding on stock prices, with terms like 'gbsn' and 'hznp'. Gold mining can be volatile and dependent on various factors, including geopolitical events or economic conditions. But I'm not sure if that directly affects the tech sector, so maybe this is more of a positive factor since gold miners are a different industry.

Third tweet talks about panw and investing in Nasdaq with shares like 'panw', 'wmt', 'bzna', etc. Panw could be a stock from a specific company, but without knowing the stock itself, it's hard to assess its impact on others. However, 'Nasdaq' is more of a market index, so this tweet might not directly relate to the target stock.

The fourth tweet mentions RT AT_USER new video about a market recap after a bounce from $y$ shares and mentions Aapl, ung, etc. A positive recapping can sometimes attract more investors, boosting sentiment positively. But without knowing what the company was doing before or how it performed afterward, it's speculative.

The fifth tweet is a bit confusing: ""rt AT_USER ironic that if $ yhoo had just sold $ baba shares when it planned spinoff, it's post-tax proceeds would be as valuable as tax-free."" This seems like a hypothetical scenario where selling shares and spinning off might change the company's value. It could influence investor sentiment by suggesting potential risks or opportunities for others, but without specific information on how this affects 'baba' directly, it's hard to gauge the overall impact.

Putting all these together: The first tweet is negative because of manufacturing contraction. The second is positive due to gold mining activity. Third and fourth tweets are less clear, with the fifth one hinting at a possible change in market dynamics but not enough information for a direct assessment. So considering these mixed signals, it's difficult to assign a strong overall sentiment. Maybe leaning towards neutral because some factors are negative while others aren't positive enough."
2015-10-02,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of [Baba] or any given company. So, first, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Let's go through them one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions ""ge general electric co"" and several exchange rates. It doesn't mention a specific stock symbol, so maybe it's not relevant for [Baba].
2. The second tweet includes ""xlp,"" which is typically associated with Xerox, but the context seems about consumer staples. Again, no clear indication of [Baba].
3. The third tweet refers to ""itek"" and ""otek,"" both pharmaceutical companies. No stock symbol here.
4. The fourth tweet talks about a trader's decision to ""outlaw"" $baba, suggesting some trading thoughts but without a specific stock name.
5. The fifth tweet mentions ""fb,"" which is Facebook, so that's probably unrelated unless [Baba] is related to Facebook, which I don't think it is.
6. The sixth tweet says ""mcdonald's standing on the shoulders of alibaba."" Again, not identifying a target stock here.
7. The seventh tweet mentions ""baba"" moving +5% and discusses volume changes, but again, no specific stock.
8. The eighth tweet talks about sellers being triggered in ""spy"" and ""aapl,"" which are unrelated unless it's about [Baba], but the context doesn't align.
9. The ninth tweet says $yhoo is relative strength and back over $30. No connection to [Baba].
10. The tenth tweet mentions ""baba very strong today."" This seems directly related to [Baba] and talks about its recent performance.
11. The eleventh tweet asks ""why?"" between ""baba"" and ""bidu,"" which is a typo but perhaps indicating more questions, not relevant for sentiment.

So, out of all these tweets, the tenth one mentions ""baba very strong today."" That gives me direct information about [Baba]'s performance. The other tweets seem to be discussing unrelated companies or ETFs related to Facebook and others. 

The user also provided a detailed example where they concluded ""[Positive]"" because it's directly tied to a stock symbol. So, I think the key here is that the tweet mentions ""baba very strong today."" This indicates that [Baba] is performing well, which would likely lead to a positive outlook on its stock price.

I should make sure not to overlook any relevant tweets but only focus on those that mention a specific target stock. In this case, only the tenth tweet provides that information. 

Since it's a direct and positive statement about [Baba]'s strength, it contributes positively to the overall sentiment."
2015-10-03,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of BABA. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at tweet 1: ""rt AT_USER $ baba our calls making +2,400 % profits right now ! 20bagger plus URL"" The mention of $ baba suggests that the stock symbol is BABA. Similarly, in tweet 2: ""URL superalerts monthly changed my financial life for the better forever , check it out ! ! ! $ trip $ baba $ jnpr"". Again, this mentions $ baba and $ jnpr, so I think the target stock is BABA.

Next, I need to analyze each tweet separately. For each relevant tweet, I'll identify Positive and Negative factors. 

Starting with tweet 1: The user is calling out a positive point that BABA's profits are up by 2400%! That sounds like a strong positive factor because it's showing significant growth. It's definitely making investors happy. So, for tweet 1, I'll note that there's a Positive factor.

Now, looking at tweet 2: This tweet is more about the user changing their financial life and providing some links. The mention of $ baba and $ jnpr doesn't indicate anything specific to BABA stock performance. It seems like this could be a positive or negative tweet depending on what's being highlighted. But without clear information, it's hard to tell if this is a positive or neutral factor. However, since the user is providing financial tools for their trip and another company, it might seem like they're offering value beyond just the stock itself.

So, in summary:
- Tweet 1: Positive factor – significant profit increase.
- Tweet 2: It's unclear but possibly positive because of value offerings, but maybe neutral if focusing solely on BABA. However, considering that the user is providing value, it might lean towards a positive overall sentiment even though tweet 2 is more about their personal finance and other companies.

Now, combining these factors. Tweet 1 is very clear about profits and positive growth, which would boost investor confidence. Tweet 2 adds value but doesn't directly relate to BABA's performance beyond offering something useful. Therefore, while tweet 2 is neutral or slightly positive in terms of value, the main impact comes from tweet 1. The overall sentiment should reflect the positive factors outweighing any negatives.

Therefore, the overall sentiment is Positive."

2015-10-05,Neutral,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative in terms of their impact on a stock like BABA (Baba Inc.). Let's break this down step by step.

First, looking at each tweet individually. 

1. The first one says $baba will have another 400 million shares hit the market in Q4 once yhoo gives them to its shareholders. So, it's talking about a lockup period. That might mean that shares are delayed until after the year ends, which could make people hold off on buying. This is usually seen as positive because they're giving more time before ex-divide or ex-split.

2. The second tweet mentions P/E ratios for BABA and other stocks: $baba $cop $f $xlv baba stocks stocks. It doesn't seem to provide any specific information about stock performance, just multiple valuations. This is vague and could be neutral because it's not giving a clear direction or prediction.

3. The third tweet has RT@user abbv abbvie inc. ideas URL with the stock prices of abbv, baba, xlk, amgn, abbv, invest nasdaq. It looks like they're linking BABA to other stocks via ideas and investing in them. This might indicate a connection or a recommendation, which could be positive as it suggests support from others.

4. The fourth tweet is about consumer discretionary select sector SPDR exchange stock prices: $xly baba fcx jnug xly tradeideas nasdaq. It mentions SPY (S&P 500 ETF) and BABA's price movements. If SPY goes up, it might indicate that the overall market is bullish, but this tweet doesn't directly talk about BABA's performance.

5. The fifth tweet discusses Canada Shares Ex-Divide Date URL with BABA stockmarket stock. It mentions ex-divide dates for both BABA and Canadian shares. Ex-divide typically signals a potential increase in share price as companies release earnings, which is a positive sign because it gives investors confidence that the stock might rise.

6. The sixth tweet has BABA prices and some financial indicators: $baba $expe $unh $jcp baba share finance. It mentions ex-divide for BABA but doesn't provide specific valuations or performance data, making this vague too.

Now, looking at each tweet's factors:

1. Positive factors include lockup expiration (so shares might be delayed), which is generally positive because it gives more time to buy.
2. The negative factor here is the P/E ratio which isn't giving a clear signal.
3. Positive factors could be BABA investing via ideas, but this might not directly impact BABA's price unless it affects investor sentiment or company fundamentals.
4. Negative factors for SPY aren't given, so this tweet doesn't provide clear information about BABA.
5. The positive factor is the ex-divide date which indicates a potential rise in stock price, which is good news.

Now, analyzing each tweet's overall impact:

-Tweet 1: Positive because of lockup expiration, but it might just delay purchase rather than immediate effect on price.
-Tweet 2: Vague, could be neutral since no clear info.
-Tweet 3: Positive via investing ideas, but not directly about BABA.
-Tweet 4: No direct information about BABA's performance; SPY up might suggest broader market up, but specific to BABA is unclear.
-Tweet 5: Positive because ex-divide suggests potential price increase.

Considering all these factors, most tweets either indicate a potential delay (positive), vague info (neutral), or positive signals that could affect prices. However, none of the tweets provide enough information about BABA's actual performance or fundamentals directly. They mostly signal investor sentiment or potential future moves but don't specifically tell us if BABA will go up, down, or stay flat.

So, putting it together, I think there's a mix of positive and negative signals. But without specific price movements or financial data from BABA, it's hard to conclude definitively. However, the ex-divide date in tweet 5 is a strong positive sign, but other tweets are more about potential or vague.

I'm leaning towards overall neutral because while there are some positive indicators like lockups and investing, none provide direct info on BABA's performance. Vague data (tweets 2 and 4) can make it seem neutral too."
2015-10-06,Negative,"Okay, let me try to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of BABA. I'm not super familiar with all the stocks mentioned here, but I'll do my best to analyze each tweet.

First, I see a list of 10 tweets. Let's go through them one by one and break down what they might be saying.

1. The first tweet is a bunch of stock names with mentions of different companies like spy, iwm, amzn, etc., all tied to $ symbols. I'm not sure if these are related to BABA specifically. Maybe it's just a list or some context, but without more info, it's hard to tell.

2. The second tweet is similar to the first one—it's a long list of stocks and their prices. Again, doesn't mention BABA directly.

3. The third tweet says ""sh proshares short s & p 500 fund ask"" and mentions googl and hclp. So it sounds like proshares might be selling shares in the S&P 500, which could be a negative factor for stocks on that index, including BABA.

4. The fourth tweet is about nyseplays, indicating that baba was called short before it collapsed. This seems like a significant event—when a stock is called into short position before its collapse, it can cause major losses because investors may panic and short the stock at a critical point.

5. The fifth tweet mentions $ baba $ tvix $ mu $ fnma. Tvxia sounds familiar as a ETF related to the S&P 500, and fnma is a bond ETF. So if BABA was being sold short, this could be another negative factor for its stock price.

6. The sixth tweet talks about eem trade ideas, EEM's price, googl, baba, owoo. Again, no mention of BABA except that it's part of the trade ideas section, so not directly related unless it affects BABA in some way.

7. The seventh tweet says ""tencent : impenetrable monopoly URL $ baba $ tcehy."" It seems likeencent owns a monopoly and mentions baba. This could indicate that baba is being bought or sold at an unexpected rate, which might affect its price.

8. The eighth tweet says ""$ baba + 1 % $ 64.73 long."" This is pretty clear—it's stating that BABA has been longed by investors with a profit of 1%, so it's not a short position but rather that it's being actively held, which doesn't directly impact its price.

9. The ninth tweet lists eom, pep, abc, dd, csco as ""early movers."" This could indicate that these companies have been around longer and are already in a competitive position, possibly influencing the market and their stock prices.

10. The tenth tweet says our penny stocks have gained over 3,500% in the past three months and mentions BABA being on their list again. Penny stocks are often short-term performers with high volatility. However, it's not clear if this has caused a significant price move yet or just a recent surge.

Putting all these together: The third tweet suggests proshares is selling shares in the S&P 500, which could lower BABA's price. The fourth tweet says baba was shorted before collapsing, which can cause immediate losses. The fifth and seventh tweets mention selling positions for BABA or as part of a transaction related to it, which likely impacts its price negatively. The tenth mentions penny stocks that went up sharply but doesn't directly affect BABA.

So the main factors affecting BABA are selling pressure from proshares (3rd tweet), short interest leading to short-term losses (4th and 7th tweets). The other tweets suggest a mix of positive news like early movers (9th) and penny stocks (10th) but not enough to outweigh the immediate negative effects.

Therefore, I think BABA is likely to be negatively affected."
2015-10-07,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to determine the impact on the stock price based on these tweets. 

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol. Looking at the tweets, none seem to provide a direct stock name yet. But some mention ""baba,"" which is a well-known stock. Maybe it's BABA? That seems likely because several tweets have mentions of ""baba"" and they're talking about stock prices.

Next, I'll break down each tweet to find positive (biib) or negative factors. 

1. The first tweet says $auy percent change updated... but this is probably a typo for $auy (which might be a currency symbol like Australian Dollar), so maybe it's not relevant.
2. The second tweet mentions ""baba alibaba group holding ltd."" This could imply BABA stock, which is in the group.
3. Third tweet talks about NUS Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc., but no mention of BABA.
4. Fourth tweet refers to General Motors (GM), but again, not directly related to BABA.
5. Fifth tweet mentions NTPA direxion and gold miners, which isn't relevant to BABA.
6. The sixth tweet talks about Microsoft stock (^MSX) with mentions like ""win 10 thing"" and ""next stop 68."" Again, no mention of BABA.

Since none of the tweets directly mention or talk about BABA, I'll infer that it's either implied by other words or not part of the given data. 

Assuming it's BABA, looking at each tweet, most don't provide positive or negative factors for BABA. The first mentions a percentage change but without specific information on performance, so maybe neutral.

The sixth tweet is about Microsoft, which might be a separate entity, not related to BABA. The others are more about stock prices in general, not impacting BABA specifically.

Without explicit mention of positive or negative factors for BABA, it's hard to determine an overall impact. However, if the focus is on other stocks, they're at specific price points but don't indicate sentiment towards BABA.

I think there's no significant information suggesting a trend for BABA, so I'll lean towards Neutral."
2015-10-08,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the likely impact on the stock price of the given company based on the provided tweets. Let me start by breaking down each tweet one by one and see what they're saying.

First tweet: ""$ baba fading ... but ma said everything is ok."" Hmm, ""fading"" could mean things are getting worse, so maybe this tweet suggests that the stock might be undervalued or facing some challenges. The mention of everything being ""ok"" adds a positive note, but the overall feeling seems uncertain.

Second tweet: ""alibaba group holding ’ s “ buy ” rating reaffirmed at cantor fitzgerald $ baba URL."" This looks like a financial analysis. If they're buying the stock, that usually means investors think it's undervalued. The fact that they've reassessed their rating could indicate confidence in the company's future performance.

Third tweet: ""aapl apple , inc . p / e ratio URL $ aapl $ dltr $ vltc $ baba aapl finance investing."" Earnings per share (P/E) is often used as a gauge of value. If the P/E ratio is getting worse, it might mean investors are seeing higher valuations, which could lead to negative sentiment.

Now, I need to assess each tweet's impact on the stock price. The first tweet mentions that things are getting ""fading,"" so maybe some underlying issues. The buy rating suggests optimism. If there's some positive news but mixed with uncertainty, it might be neutral. The second tweet is a financial analysis pointing towards undervalued stock; that's usually a good sign for the stock price. The third tweet talks about P/E ratio; if it's worse, that could hurt the stock.

Putting it all together: There's some uncertainty in the first tweet, positive buy ratings in others, and mixed information about the financial metrics. Since there's both positive (buy ratings) and mixed (undervalued stock) factors, it seems like the sentiment is uncertain. I'll lean towards a neutral stance because there are conflicting signals."
2015-10-09,Positive,"Alright, I need to figure out the likely impact on the stock price of the given company based on these tweets. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at each tweet individually and identifying both positive and negative factors for each. 

1. alibaba cancelled its investment plan in micromax URL $ baba. So, this is a negative factor because the company might lose money or face losses from that investment.

2. ab alliancebernstein holding lp ex-div date URL $ ab $ iwm $ swn $ baba ab stocks tradeideas. This could be positive if there's good news about trading ideas or if AB stock is seen as undervalued, but it seems like just a general statement without specific details on the company.

3. URL & - tim grittani new trading DVD looks cool! Discussing something related to DIS and others. Maybe this ties into DIS's performance or other companies, which could have an impact on their stock prices.

4. china stocks $ baba alibaba group daily : 2.14 % weekly : 15 % ytd : -34.87 % trend : 74 / 100 URL. The numbers here are some financial ratios and percentages. A negative trend percentage (-34.87%) suggests the company's performance is down, which could be a cause for concern if this relates to a major issue affecting their stock.

5. why yahoo and alibaba stocks are rallying: This tweet seems positive about the rally of these stocks but doesn't specify the reason or factors influencing it.

6. nbix neurocrine biosciences , inc . p / e ratio URL $ nbix $ bgs $ icn $ baba nbix share stockmarket. An update on their P/E ratio could indicate management's expectations or earnings, which might influence stock price.

7. alibaba and tencent creating the O2O powerhouse: This sounds like a positive move because it's showing progress in expanding their reach or services through e-commerce or online commerce.

8. googl alphabet inc . stock forum URL $ googl $ spxu $ baba $ jnug googl stock share URL: Similar to tweet 4, some financial information about GOOGL, which could have a negative impact if they're facing issues affecting their performance.

9. rt AT_USER alibaba's jack ma says concerns about slowing consumption in china are overdone: This seems like a positive statement because it addresses the company's internal issues or management talking things over, which can be seen as a positive signal for growth.

Now, considering all these factors together. The company, Alibaba, has shown positive signs with their O2O efforts and positive management comments. However, they are cancelling an investment, which is negative. Also, GOOGL is being discussed positively because of management talking things over. But the cancel investment could reduce overall momentum.

There's also a mix of general stock updates about other companies like AB and DIS, but those might not have a direct impact on Alibaba unless there's a correlation. The P/E ratio update (tweet 6) could be positive or negative depending on the company's performance, but without specifics, it's hard to say.

Putting it all together: Positive factors include O2O expansion, management comments, and positive news about GOOGL. Negative factors are the cancellation of investment plans. The overall sentiment seems mixed but leaning towards a positive because of the positive external factors outweighing the immediate negative."
2015-10-10,Neutral,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how these tweets affect TSLA's stock price. Let me start by looking at the first tweet. It says that the $tsla company info was updated on Saturday, October 10, 2015, and the time is midday local time. Hmm, I don't know much about this specific tweet because it just updates information without any positive or negative keywords.

Now, moving to the second tweet, again it's an update for October 10th at midday. Same situation here—just updating info without stating whether it's good or bad. So both tweets are providing company info but don't mention anything positive or negative about the stock.

Since there's no specific positive or negative word in either tweet, I'm leaning towards neutral. The information is out-of-date and doesn't reflect any current events affecting TSLA. There's no reason to assume it's going up or down. So, my conclusion should be Neutral."
2015-10-11,Missing,File not found
2015-10-12,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of BABA. Let me go through each tweet one by one and see what they're saying.

First tweet: ""Our platinum members have been seeing massive gains on our penny stock picks ! subscribe today : URL $ segi $ baba $ swet"". It looks like they're promoting BABA using links, maybe to attract subscribers or watch some video. That's probably positive because people are looking at the stock for investment reasons.

Second tweet: ""what would you do with $ 38billion ? URL $ yhoo $ baba ipo investing bigbusiness businesstrends yahoomail alibabatalk"". They're asking about investing in BABA and they mention a large amount of money. This seems to be more market-driven and speculative, which could make investors feel anxious or cautious.

Third tweet: ""$ baba buys $ ebay as a way to piss off shareholders even more ? it would work ."". They're talking about buying EBAY for BABA. That's an acquisition move, which is generally seen as positive by some because it can increase the stock price and reduce debt. But if they're trying to make money by selling shares, it might be negative.

Fourth tweet: ""dow dow chemical co . tick URL $ dow $ baba $ ocat $ spxl dow invest nasdaq"". They mention Dow Chemical Co., so maybe there's a news about the company that could affect BABA. If there's good news from Dow, it could help BABA. But if it's bad news, it might go down.

Fifth tweet: ""rt AT_USER alibaba $ baba stock up as china stocks hit seven-week high URL"". They're linking their stock to China's stocks hitting a high. That seems like a positive story because China is a major market and could influence BABA's performance.

Sixth tweet: ""$ baba alibaba group holding ltd . last price URL $ baba $ xlb $ goro $ cxr.to baba nasdaq invest"". They're just updating the stock price and mentioning NASDAQ. It doesn't show any positive or negative action, so it might not have a huge impact.

Seventh tweet: ""$ eem ishares msci emerging markets chart URL $ eem $ baba $ iyr $ lnkd eem invest stock"". They're looking into an EEM stock, which is related to BABA. Maybe they're trying to capitalize on emerging market trends, so positive.

Eighth tweet: ""$ spxl direxion daily s & p 500 bull 3x shares stock forum URL $ spxl $ baba $ mu $ nem spxl investing finance"". They mention the S&P 500 is bullish and are looking for BABA. If the market is good, this could be positive for BABA.

Ninth tweet: ""$ ambs amarantus bioscience holdings , inc . bid URL $ ambs $ baba $ biod $ uscr ambs share tradeideas"". Another buy order from Ambs to BABA. Similar to the third tweet, an acquisition move which could increase stock value and reduce debt.

Tenth tweet: ""$ baba filled sell 8 oct -30-15 65.00 call @ 6.35 limit to close ... 121 % return URL"". They're offering a call option for BABA with specific parameters. This seems like speculative trading, which could make investors nervous about the price.

So putting it all together: The tweets mostly mention promotions, stock price updates, and buy orders. Positive ones include promoting BABA, acquiring EBAY, stock updates from Dow Chemical and S&P 500, and a buy order. Negative are the market-driven investing tweet and the speculative trading. So overall, there's a mix of positive actions like investments and buys, but one big negative from the market-driven tweet could have an impact.

I'm leaning towards the stock being negatively affected because the second tweet is very speculative and could be risky for investors. The other tweets are more about moving into or supporting BABA in various ways."
2015-10-13,Positive,"Alright, I need to determine how the given tweets are likely to impact the stock price of a company. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I should identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking through each tweet, I notice some mentions like ""Tesla"" and ""Alibaba,"" which are tech companies. But without knowing the specific stock, I might have difficulty. Maybe I can infer based on common symbols or look for a pattern.

Next, each tweet is analyzed by separating positive (T+) and negative (T-) factors. For example, tweet 1 mentions several stocks like TSLA, AMZN, NFLX, USO, etc. This suggests the stock might be in the tech sector. Similarly, tweets mention things like ""uber,"" ""airbnb,"" ""baba,"" which are often associated with tech and maybe startups.

Sentiment is evaluated based on context. If a tweet talks about positive events or investments, it tends to boost sentiment. Conversely, if it's negative or speculative, it might have the opposite effect. However, some tweets can be ambiguous or lack sufficient information.

Looking at each tweet:

1. The first one mentions multiple tech stocks and mentions ""url,"" which could indicate investor interest.
2. Second tweet is about building a home for Alibaba but doesn't specify sentiment yet.
3. Third tweet is somewhat negative with a quote suggesting user dislike, possibly indicating concern or negative news.
4. Fourth tweet talks about an economic event on Oct 13, so it's more about current events affecting the stock.
5. Fifth tweet discusses payment firms and their domains, which could be positive if they're financial services companies.
6. Sixth is about China stimulus, which might be positive for a company's growth in that market.
7. Seventh mentions an update on another tech stock with economic data; likely positive as it could impact the stock.
8. Eighth tweet is vague and seems speculative.

Combining all these, many tweets are related to positive events, especially financial services (uber, Airbnb) and tech companies (Tesla, Alibaba). The presence of URLs suggests interest or investment, which usually points to a positive outlook. 

However, some tweets are speculative with unclear intentions (like the third tweet), so I'm not entirely sure about their impact. But most seem to be positive in nature.

So overall, considering both specific and general trends, it seems the stock is likely performing well."
2015-10-14,Neutral,"Okay, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on BABA stock. I'm new to analyzing stock market tweets, so I'll take it step by step.

First, the task is to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking through each one:

1. The first tweet mentions ""retirement strategy"" and talks about idle cash for dividend growth investors. That doesn't seem to directly mention BABA. So maybe this tweet isn't relevant unless there's some hidden connection.

2. The second tweet has ""dal delta air lines inc."" which I think is Delta Air Lines, not BABA. 

3. Third tweet: ""sbux starbucks corp . last trade URL $ sbux $ aezs $ baba $ xle sbux stockmarket investing"" – SBUX looks like a possible typo for Starbought or BABA. Maybe it's about Starbought? Not sure.

4. Fourth tweet: ""$ ivv recent news updated tuesday , october 13 , 2015 11:11 : 01 pm $ sh $ baba $ svxy $ ko URL"" – IVV, SVXY, KO are other stocks I recognize. Not BABA.

5. Fifth tweet: ""best daytrading scalping movers w / highavgliquidity $ vxx $ xiv $ baba $ nflx $ uvxy $ spxu $ gpro URL technical scans"" – VXX is VIX (volatility index), which is related to stock prices, but not BABA.

6. Sixth tweet: ""xli industrials select sector spdr last price URL $ xli $ anto . l $ aapl $ baba xli nasdaq invest"" – XLI is S&P 500, APLP isn't mentioned, BABA is the target. 

7. Seventh tweet: ""alibaba : scaling up cloud services in the u . s . URL $ amzn $ bidu $ tcehy $ baba"" – AMZN is Amazon, so maybe this is a typo for BABA? I'm not certain.

8. Eighth tweet: ""( amzn ) shouldn ’ t discount alibaba ( baba ) threat just yet $ am zn baba amazon alibaba URL"" – This seems to imply that either company could be affected by the other due to some threat, which might impact stock prices. 

9. Ninth tweet: ""marissa mayer will determine her fate ! URL $ yhoo $ baba merger ipo money bigbusiness"" – YHOO is Yahoo, so maybe this is a typo for BABA? Or just unrelated?

10. Tenth tweet: ""mu micron technology , inc . day high URL $ mu $ blk $ baba $ amzn mu invest nasdaq"" – MU is also known as Mu (or sometimes MUnter), and AMZN again.

So, from this initial analysis, it seems most tweets are about other stocks like Delta, Starbought, VIX, XLI, Amazon, Yahoo, and MU. None directly mention BABA. Therefore, maybe the impact on BABA is minimal or none.

But wait, let me double-check each tweet again in case I missed something:

1. Retirement strategy for idle cash – could this be related to dividend growth? Maybe indirectly influencing stock price.

2. Delta Air Lines – if it's a typo, maybe a misspelling. If not, no relation.

3. Starbought – probably not BABA. It might be Starbought or something else.

4. IVV and SVXY – other stocks. 

5. VIX – related to stock price.

6. XLI (S&P 500), APLP, AMZN. Maybe related if there's a sector analysis? Not sure.

7. AMZN – typo for BABA. So maybe this tweet is about BABA?

8. Theta threat – indicating a potential conflict or threat between AMZN and BABA. That could be significant.

9. Marissa MAYER merger – unrelated, unless it's a typo.

10. MU – again, related to mu (MUnter) technology company.

So the tweets 7 and 10 mention BABA or are related due to misspellings. Specifically, tweet 7 is about AMZN scaling up cloud services in the U.S., which could relate to BABA if it's a typo. Similarly, tweet 10 talks about MU, which might be mu (MUnter) technology.

Therefore, based on these tweets, there seems to be some indication that either AMZN or BABA is under threat. If there's potential for a merger or conflict between them, that could affect the stock prices. But without more context from other tweets like 8 about a theta threat, it's hard to say if multiple stocks are at risk.

Given that most of the tweets don't mention BABA and only have others involved in sector analysis or related topics, I'm leaning towards the overall sentiment being neutral because there's no direct information suggesting an upward or downward trend."
2015-10-15,Neutral,"Alright, I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of BABA. Let me start by identifying the target stock symbol from each tweet.

Looking at the first tweet: ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . shares URL $ baba $ wmt $ aem $ atvi baba invest nasdaq"". The target stock here is BABA, which stands for Banya Group Limited. 

The second tweet mentions TRIP, but since it doesn't involve BABA directly, I'll ignore that.

Next tweet: ""$ baba alanc : lots of short covering between here and $100.00+ . : alanc URL"". Again, focusing on BABA as the target stock symbol.

Then, ""baba may have a chance at the 100dma"" – this is clearly an analysis from TRIP about BABA's potential to reach the 100 DMA index. 

The last tweet: ""$ baba at $71 now , lets see how it reacts . if it holds not good . i want to see a peak . next 10 min . lets see"". This seems to be a general outlook on BABA, suggesting it's possible for the stock price to rise but may plateau or face some challenges in the near term.

Now, breaking down each tweet:

1. First and second tweets are about short-covering activities by TRIP, which can affect investor sentiment. However, these statements don't provide specific information about BABA's performance yet.
2. The third tweet is a direct statement from TRIP suggesting that BABA may have a chance to reach the 100 DMA index.
3. The fourth tweet is a general outlook from TRIP, indicating confidence in BABA's potential but expecting some headwinds.

Considering the information available:
- TRIP (from tweets 2 and 4) has provided sentiment towards BABA, suggesting positive thoughts about potential gains.
- However, all these tweets are somewhat vague and lack concrete data points. They primarily mention BABA's performance in terms of index potential but don't provide quantitative analysis or specific metrics.

In the context of stock market analysis, without clear information on earnings, fundamentals, or news that could impact the company, it's challenging to determine a strong positive or negative sentiment. These tweets are more about TRIP's views rather than BABA's current financial health or prospects.

Therefore, despite TRIP's comments, there isn't enough data to confidently rate these tweets as positive, neutral, or negative for BABA's stock price impact."
2015-10-16,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze the given tweets and determine their likely impact on the stock price of BABA. Let me break down each tweet step by step.

1. **Extracting the Target Stock**: The main stock mentioned is BABA (Baba). All other companies listed are either factors or unrelated to the target.

2. **Tweet-by-Tweet Analysis**:
   - **Tweet 1**: ""baba bank of america corp . stock forum URL $ baba $ aapl $ mcd $ celg baba pennystocks nasdaq"" – This doesn't provide specific information about BABA's performance, so I can't assess sentiment.
   - **Tweet 2**: ""yumyum ! brands inc . ask URL $ yum $ eum $ amba $ babayum investing stockmarket"" – No mention of BABA. Not useful for analysis.
   - **Tweet 3**: ""$ yoku bought by $ baba stocks"" – This refers to YOKU, which isn't related to BABA. Maybe implying investment interest but no clear impact on BABA's stock price.
   - **Tweet 4**: ""rt AT_USER china ’ s amazon ( alibaba ) buys china ’ s youtube ( youku ) URL $ baba $ yoku URL"" – The user is buying YouTube from Alibaba, which doesn't affect BABA. No info on stock performance.
   - **Tweet 5**: ""$ baba : alibaba group holding downgraded to hold at vetr inc . ( baba ): URL"" – Alibaba's stock is being lowered, which might indicate concern about their financial health or management, but unless BABA is tied to Alibaba, it doesn't directly impact.
   - **Tweet 6**: ""us stock futures edge lower ahead of industrial production , consumer sentiment data $ baba $ ge $ hon via AT_USER URL"" – This mentions US stock futures and consumer sentiment. While positive trends could be good for stocks, the mention of industrial production and consumer sentiment might hint at future economic conditions affecting BABA's stock, but it's not clear how strong these trends are.
   - **Tweet 7**: ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . day low URL $ baba $ iwf $ wynn $ mat baba share stock"" – Similar to Tweet 3, no direct link to BABA. Just investor interest.
   - **Tweet 8**: ""$ spy $ aapl $ baba $ wmt not much i know , but i just locked in 3 % on a 3yr cd"" – This refers to SPy (SPY), which is a stock of BABA. It mentions that the user has locked in a 3% CD, which could indicate confidence or expectation, possibly positive for future performance.
   - **Tweet 9**: ""$ zacks downgrades alibaba group holding to sell ( baba ) URL $ baba"" – This directly says BABA is being sold by Zacks. A sale could be negative news if it affects investor sentiment or stock price.
   - **Tweet 10**: ""$ tlt ishares barclays 20 + year treasury bond fund stock forum URL $ tlt $ xiv $ xly $ baba tlt nasdaq tradeideas"" – Another unrelated investment, no impact on BABA.
   - **Tweet 11**: ""$ wow ! in the first half of october $ baba is up more than 4 times the $ spy 16 % vs less than 4 %

3. **Overall Sentiment Summary**:
   - Tweets 8 and 9 mention selling BABA, which can be seen as negative news. However,Tweet 5 suggests US stock futures are expected to edge lower, which might indicate positive market sentiment despite the price movement.
   - The positive tweet (Tweet 11) shows BABA's performance compared to SPY in October, but without context on how that affects BABA itself, it's hard to determine the impact.

Considering all factors, Tweet 11 provides a direct comparison of BABA and SPY, which might give some insight into their relative valuations. However, since it doesn't directly mention stock performance or trends affecting BABA, I can't be certain it's positive or negative for its price movement."
2015-10-17,Missing,File not found
2015-10-18,Negative,"Alright, let's figure out how to analyze these tweets about BABA stock and determine their impact on its future stock price. I'm not super familiar with all the stock symbols or the specific trends in the market, so I'll have to go through each tweet one by one.

First, the user provided three tweets that need analysis. Let me take them step by step.

1. The first tweet says, ""not as bullish as $ baba . this one is actually setting up for a short . $ yhoo URL."" Hmm, it starts with ""$ baba ."" That's the stock symbol BABA. So I can ignore the dollar signs and focus on what comes after. It mentions that the user thinks BABA isn't as bullish, implying maybe they have a fear or uncertainty about it. Then it says this tweet is setting up for a short position on YHOO (which might be $ yhoo). A short position usually involves betting against the stock's price movement. If someone is planning to short YHOO, that could mean buying a futures contract or something like that, which can increase BABA's price because you're taking a risk. But I'm not sure if this tweet itself is positive or negative for BABA.

2. The second tweet says, ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . ideas URL $ baba $ xlf $ xlk $ tna baba pennystocks stocksbac bank of america corp . …"". This seems like a list of stocks, including BABA. The words ""group holding"" and ""ideas"" make me think about BABA's management or vision for the company. That could be positive because a strong management team can drive growth and future success. However, it might also be vague without specific information on the stock performance.

3. The third tweet: ""$ vxx ipath s & p 500 vix short-term futures etn financials URL $ vxx $ baba $ googl $ xlp vxx finance tradeideasvz …"". This one includes VIX (the volatility index), which is a popular technical indicator related to market risk. A short-term futures contract could mean betting on low prices, possibly increasing BABA's price or decreasing the VIX index due to fear of excessive volatility. Also, ""futures etn"" might be referring to exchange-traded funds or ETFs that track VIX. The user is discussing financials, trade ideas, and trading strategies related to these stocks. This could indicate a positive outlook on investing in financials, which BABA might be part of.

Now, summarizing the impact:

- The tweet about the management team (2nd tweet) seems positive but vague.
- The third tweet mentions VIX futures, which can influence stock prices by affecting investor sentiment towards volatility.
- However, without specific information on other factors like earnings reports, economic data, or company-specific news, it's hard to say if BABA is bullish or bearish.

Considering all these points, while the management team and financials suggest potential for improvement or growth, the third tweet introduces risk factors through VIX. It might lead to mixed sentiment but leans more towards caution rather than sharp up or down."
2015-10-19,Positive,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how these tweets are affecting BABA stock's future price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet: ""stock showdown : $ baba vs . $ amzn ; which is a better buy ? URL"". The stock symbols here are ""baba"" and ""amzn"", but since the main focus seems to be on BABA, I think that's the one.

Next, for each tweet, I'll separate them into positive ( boost) and negative factors. Then assess their sentiment towards investor sentiment.

Starting with tweet 1: It's a comparison between BABA and AMZN. The user is asking which is a better buy. This seems like a neutral statement because it's more of a question rather than an action or opinion on the stock itself. So, no clear positive or negative factors here. Sentiment remains Neutral.

Tweet 2 mentions NFLX partnering to enter China and a new report about BABA, BUD, and NFLX. Positive factors are BABA, BUD, and NFLX. But since it's just reporting without any action, the sentiment isNeutral because no explicit positive or negative words.

Tweet 3 repeats tweet 2 with the same content: NFLX partnering into China and a report about three stocks. It doesn't provide any action or opinion beyond what's in the report. So again, Sentiment Neutral.

Tweet 4 is identical to tweet 3. Same reasoning applies—just more repetition of the same content without action. Sentiment remains Neutral.

Now, tweet 5: RT AT_USER mentions NFLX partnering into China and a report about BABA, BUD, NFLX. Again, just providing information without any action or opinion. No positive or negative signals. So, Sentiment Neutral.

Tweet 6 talks about BABA stock up due to being kept off the U.S. piracy blacklist. This seems like a strong positive factor because it's a regulatory move that could impact the stock. Let me note this as boost with a 4-star sentiment since it's a significant event but not entirely clear if it will lead to an increase in price.

Tweet 7 is about BABA running off lows and into a trend, asking if there will be the first ever MACD cross above higher highs. This seems like a technical analysis question without any positive or negative action. So, no clear sentiment here—Sentiment Neutral.

 Tweet 8 mentions that $BABA was called short in February before the collapse on China's NYSE. This is a regulatory move by the NYSE causing BABA to be sold short, which could lead to a price decline. This is a strong negative factor as it affects investor confidence and stock movement. So, this is boost with a 4-star sentiment because there are concerns about potential decline.

Finally, tweet 9 talks about double Eleven being a catalyst for Alibaba shares, citing summit research on BABA and JD. Again, just providing information without any action or opinion—sentiment remains Neutral.

Now, summarizing the factors:

- Boost from China piracy blacklist (6) and regulatory move for shorting (8)
- No significant positive or negative factors from tweets 1-5 except the one about trend which is neutral.
- Only a minor boost, so overall sentiment is Positive.

So, combining all these, the positive boost from tweet 6 and 8 will likely outweigh the neutral sentiment of the rest. Therefore, the overall sentiment is Positive."
2015-10-20,Negative,"Alright, so I've got these three tweets and I need to figure out their impact on the stock price of some company based on them. Let me take it step by step.

First, I'll look at each tweet individually to see what they're saying about the company. The target stock symbol isn't given directly, but from the first tweet, I can tell that it's related to China September retail sales. That could be something like a consumer goods or retail services company. 

Looking at the second tweet: "" $ yhoo $ baba : yahoo adjusted revenue falls ; company signs ad pact with google : URL "". YHOO is a stock symbol, so it's probably another company in the same sector as china september. The fact that their revenue fell and they signed an agreement with Google suggests some issues or maybe strategic moves. Revenue falling could indicate negative sentiment because it might affect investor confidence.

The third tweet: "" AT_USER at least $ yhoo has $ baba windfall ... "". This seems a bit more ambiguous. It mentions ""windfall"" which is a positive term, but I'm not sure if that means the company itself is doing well or just the person's situation. Maybe it's part of the broader market sentiment influenced by other factors.

Now, combining these thoughts: The first tweet talks about retail sales and YHOO. Second shows revenue issues. Third mentions a windfall related to YHOO. If both tweets are pointing towards negative aspects like reduced revenue or possible issues, that could be a contributing factor. But the third tweet is vague, so it's hard to assess its impact on the company itself.

However, considering the overall market trends and sector performance often show mixed results, especially when some sectors face challenges while others might see growth. Combining these hints, I can't say for certain if there's a strong positive or negative effect. Maybe it's in the middle ground, but it's not clear-cut."
2015-10-21,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and figure out if they're positive, neutral, or negative for the stock of XLY. Let me start by understanding what each tweet is saying.

The first tweet mentions multiple sector ETFs like SPDR (S&P 500), CMG, BABA, TMV, and Pennystocks. The next lines are about finance. I know that ETFs often represent a diversified portfolio of stocks, so this could mean that the tweets are talking about different sectors within the same index.

I'm not very familiar with all these stocks, but maybe they're part of an investment group focusing on certain areas. The term ""consumer discretionary"" suggests it's focused on consumer products or services. So each tweet is highlighting a sector ETF under a financial category, perhaps related to finance and consumer sectors.

Since the tweets are multiple mentions of ETFs with different components, it seems like they're providing various investment opportunities across different sectors within the broader SPDR index. If the user is looking at stock prices, having these ETFs could represent diversification for investors, which might not significantly affect their performance unless there's a trend in individual stocks.

However, without specific information about the current prices or trends in each ETF, it's hard to tell if they're positive or negative. They're just mentions of ETFs; their impact on the stock price would depend on how stable these ETFs are and how others have performed collectively.

Considering the overall context and that all tweets are providing sector-specific ETFs, I think the sentiment is neutral because it doesn't directly mention anything about the stock's performance or any positive/negative indicators. It's more about suggesting investments in different sectors rather than affecting the price."
2015-10-22,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided several tweets and wants me to determine their likely impact on the stock price of a company. Hmm, they also mentioned an example output that uses ""[Positive]"" for an increasing trend.

First, I need to extract the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""iwm russell 2000 ishares % change URL $ iwm $ tqqq $ baba $ atvi iwm trade ideas stock."" It seems like it's referring to a tweet about TQQQ (tilly Technologies), which I know is a ETF related to Russell 2000 indices. So the target stock is probably TQQQ.

Next, each tweet has factors and sentiment analysis. Let me go through them one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions iwm russell 2000 ishares with % change and some URLs pointing to other stocks like TQQQ, Ferrari, etc. It doesn't specify a company's stock symbol clearly. Maybe it's not the correct one. Not sure yet.

2. The second tweet talks about AT_USER trading Ferrari shares, etfs, ipo (IPO), cars, race, FDC, and TwTr. Again, not clear on which stock. Could be Ferrari or another car-related ETF?

3. Third tweet updates $BABA financials for October 22, 2015, mentioning TSLA, QCOM, IBM, GDSI. This seems related to tech stocks, possibly iShares Global S&P 500 Dividend-Adjusted Shares (GDSI), which I know tracks tech-related ETFs.

4. The fourth tweet just mentions ""baba"" with some URLs and text like ~ via URL. Not clear on the stock here either. Maybe it's related to another sector, but without more info, hard to say.

Now, considering each tweet: the first one has several stocks mentioned but unclear which is the target. The second could be a tech ETF or perhaps a car-related one, depending on context. The third clearly talks about financials for BABA, which seems like a specific company's financial data. The fourth is ambiguous.

Since I can't pinpoint the exact stock from the first tweet, maybe it's better to focus on tweets that provide more concrete information. In this case, the third tweet gives significant info about financials for BABA, which would affect investors' views on the stock.

But wait, the second tweet mentions AT_USER trading Ferrari shares. If Ferrari is a well-known car company, perhaps this could indicate positive sentiment towards automotive stocks, but that's speculative and not directly linked to TQQQ.

The fourth tweet is unclear again, so maybe it's better to look for tweets with actionable information about specific stocks or ETFs related to them.

In the given example, only the third tweet provides a financial update, which might influence the sentiment towards BABA. However, without knowing if there are other tweets about TQQQ or ferrari, it's hard to assess overall sentiment. But since I can't see more tweets, perhaps focusing on those that directly mention the stock is better.

So, considering all, the main tweet about BABA would provide the most direct impact information, but since I can only analyze based on provided data, I'll assume each relevant tweet contributes its own sentiment assessment."
2015-10-23,Neutral,"Alright, I need to determine the impact on the stock price for the given tweets regarding BABA stock. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the target stock is BABA, so that's our main focus. The user provided two tweets related to this stock.

Looking at the first tweet: ""ftnt fortinet inc . last price URL $ ftnt $ baba $ rsp $ fun ftnt stockmarket share."" Hmm, not sure what this is about. It mentions Fortinet and other stocks but doesn't seem directly relevant to BABA. Maybe it's a placeholder or irrelevant.

Next tweet: ""trade - - $ baba : exit long at 73.8 , date = 10/23 / 2015 , time = 10:49 : 56:0."" This mentions the user exiting a long position at 73.8 on BABA, which is about selling a certain number of shares at that price point.

But wait, I need to separate factors for each tweet. For the first tweet, it's unclear what the ""Positive"" and ""Negative"" factors are since it doesn't specify anything relevant to BABA. The second tweet only deals with BABA exiting a position, which affects investor sentiment.

The user also mentioned an overall sentiment summary: combining factors to conclude. However, since the first tweet is not related, I might be missing something. Maybe Fortinet's tweet is a distraction, but it doesn't mention anything about BABA.

Looking at the output requirements, I need to summarize each tweet for positive or negative factors and then decide on the overall impact. But without relevant information from the first tweet, I can only analyze the second one. The exit long position might mean selling stock, which could reduce demand, but it's a short action rather than sentiment analysis.

I think the second tweet is the main relevant one for BABA. It mentions exiting a long position at 73.8, so that's a negative event because selling shares would decrease supply and increase demand if prices are rising. However, without knowing if this move was driven by positive news or not, it's tricky.

But since I can only use the given tweets to determine the overall impact, maybe I should consider the user's instructions again. The first tweet is about Fortinet, which might be a distraction but doesn't relate to BABA. So perhaps the overall sentiment depends on whether the second tweet affects BABA positively or negatively. Since it's an exit of shares, that's a short action and could indicate negative sentiment if other factors are favorable.

Wait, but the user didn't provide any other related tweets about BABA, so I might have to assume based on the information given. The exit long position at 73.8 could indicate a negative view because it's selling shares, which is a short-term action. But without more context, I can't be certain.

Given that, maybe the overall sentiment is neutral because the tweet doesn't provide enough relevant information to assess polarity. However, since BABA was involved in this exit and there might have been other movements on BABA's part, perhaps it leans towards negative. Alternatively, if the user thinks exiting a long position reduces supply and increases demand but other factors don't move much, it could be neutral.

I'm a bit stuck because the first tweet doesn't help. Maybe I should default to looking at the second tweet alone. The exit of shares is a short-term event, so without more context or data points from BABA's performance, it's hard to assess the overall impact on the stock price. So perhaps the sentiment is neutral.

Wait, but if other factors are present in the tweets that suggest BABA is undervalued or overvalued? The second tweet mentions ""oversold will start to squeezed,"" which indicates that the market may be selling more because it's overvalued. If that's true, and there's a positive outlook for BABA, maybe it would go up.

But without explicit information from other tweets on this topic, I can't conclude definitively. The output requirement is one line with [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Since the first tweet doesn't mention anything about BABA, perhaps I should focus only on the second tweet's impact. But that tweet is about exiting a position, not about BABA.

I think maybe I'm supposed to look at all tweets together and assess based on their content. The first tweet seems to be unrelated, but it mentions Fortinet. Maybe the user intended for me to analyze both. If I consider both, the first tweet doesn't affect BABA, so perhaps the overall sentiment is neutral because other factors are not given.

Wait, no, the second tweet's exit of shares would imply that investors are selling stock at 73.8, which might reduce supply and increase demand if prices go up, but without knowing market conditions, it's hard to tell. Maybe it leans towards negative because selling more could be seen as overreaction.

But I'm not sure. Since the user didn't provide any other tweets related to BABA beyond this point, maybe I should assume that based on the available information, the impact is neutral or positive.

Wait, perhaps I misread the first tweet. It mentions ""last price URL $ ftnt $ baba $ rsp $ fun ftnt stockmarket share."" Maybe ""ftnt"" refers to Fortinet, which could be a typo or irrelevant. So, in terms of BABA, maybe that's just additional info about other stocks.

So perhaps the overall impact is neutral because neither tweet provides specific information about BABA. But if I have to choose based on available data, and assuming that BABA was involved in an exit, which could indicate a negative sentiment but without further context, it might be considered neutral or slightly positive.

I think given all this uncertainty, perhaps the overall sentiment is [Neutral] because neither tweet directly provides information about BABA's performance affecting its price."
2015-10-24,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out how these tweets impact the future stock price of a company. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I see each tweet is about a different stock. But wait, the user hasn't specified which stock they're looking at, right? Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Maybe it's implied or maybe one of them refers to a specific stock like YHOO or others. Looking back, the target stock symbol isn't provided in the output. That might be an oversight, but I can still process each tweet as individual stocks.

Starting with the first tweet: ""Yahoo earnings review q3 2015 $ yhoo also $ baba $ hdp URL"". So, it's talking about Yahoo's Q3 earnings and mentions other companies like BABA and HDP. Since this is an earnings report, it's likely to positively influence investor sentiment because earnings usually indicate a good direction for the stock.

Next tweet: ""what would you do with $ 38billion ? URL $ yhoo $ baba ipo investing bigbusiness businesstrends yahoomail alibabatalk"". This seems more personal, mentioning investments and trends. It's speculative but could be seen as encouraging investors to take certain actions. Maybe it adds to the stock's potential.

Third tweet: ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . dividend URL $ baba $ pbr $ googl $ jnug baba stockmarket sto … URL"". BABA is a dividend-paying company, so this might support their performance with better earnings and dividends, which could be good for the stock price. It's also linking to other companies like Google.

Putting it all together: The first tweet gives a positive outlook on Yahoo, the second is more speculative but suggests growth opportunities, and the third highlights dividend potential which can be a sign of strong fundamentals. Combining these, there are multiple positive factors, making the overall sentiment likely positive."
2015-10-25,Neutral,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze the given tweets about the stock price impact on the future. The tweet is ""rt AT_USER $ baba results likely to dim outlook for china consumer spending URL"". Let me break it down step by step.

First, identifying the target stock. The word ""baba"" suggests that BABA stock is mentioned here. I'll note that as the main focus.

Next, looking at each tweet separately. This one seems like a tweet from an individual user (maybe someone familiar with the stock) making a statement about their opinion on BABA results potentially affecting consumer spending in China. 

For step 2(a), separating positive and negative factors. The tweet mentions that results are likely to dim the outlook for consumer spending, implying that improved results could make consumers spend less or not as much. So, I'm leaning towards both positive and negative factors here because it's a mix of opinions.

Now, assessing sentiment. It says ""results likely to dim Outlook"", which suggests uncertainty about how the results will affect consumer behavior. That sounds like mixed signals—some might think it could be bad for revenue (negative), but others could see growth or no change (positive). It's a bit unclear on whether it's positive or negative.

Combining the factors and sentiment, the tweet seems to indicate both potential improvement and possible decline in consumer spending. This makes me consider it neutral because there's an uncertainty about the impact, which might not be clear-cut."
2015-10-26,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how these tweets are impacting the stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ baba jblu $ twtr $ aapl $ lnkd $ pnra $ gild $ amgn $ gpro nxpi $ bwld $ ffiv $ yelp $ fslr $ deck $ crus $ sbux $ bidu scty $ expe URL"". It looks like it's about AT_USER stock with multiple sectors, maybe something related to tech or renewable energy since those are the companies listed.

Now, looking at each tweet:

1. ""rt AT_USER $ baba jblu $ twtr $ aapl $ lnkd $ pnra $ gild $ amgn $ gpro nxpi $ bwld $ ffiv $ yelp $ fslr $ deck $ crus $ sbux $ bidu scty $ expe URL"" – This seems to be a list of different stocks and sectors. It's providing information about various companies, which might indicate market conditions or news across multiple industries.

2. ""$ baba hod . pre er pop"" – The term ""hod"" is slang for ""hot,"" so this looks like stock prices are going up. The mention of popular trends makes me think people are expecting positive developments.

3. ""uptate analysis on $ aapl $ amzn $ axp $ baba $ cvx $ fb $ ibm $ mon $ xom $ msft $ goog $ ym_f $ es_f $ nq_f $ cl_f URL"" – This seems like an update about upcoming earnings or financial news related to these companies. Since it's an analysis, it might give investors a sense of the company's performance ahead of the market.

4. ""rt AT_USER big earnings watch day tomorrow for hedgies . many of their top favorite to repport bmo : $ baba $ hca $ pfe $ tmus $ bmy URL"" – This tweet is about upcoming earnings reports for several companies, specifically mentioning hedge funds and BMO (which I think stands for Bank of America or maybe a different financial institution). The mention of BMO suggests there's some interest in their performance.

5. ""$ baba strong .. i was wrong about it just didnt want full er risk on my book"" – This seems more emotional, usingster and saying they were mistaken about something. It might indicate uncertainty or dissatisfaction with their stock performance, which could lead to negative sentiment if people are worried about potential losses.

6. ""rt AT_USER $ baba jblu $ twtr $ aapl $ lnkd $ pnra $ gild $ amgn $ gpro nxpi $ bwld $ ffiv $ yelp $ fslr $ deck $ crus $ sbux $ bidu scty $ expe URL"" – Similar to the first tweet, it's providing information across multiple sectors. It could be an update on market conditions or industry trends.

7. ""rt AT_USER top upcoming earnings $ baba $ f $ jblu $ ups $ pfe bp $ glw $ save $ cmcsa $ grub $ coh $ mrk $ cake URL URL"" – Another update with mentions of specific companies and sectors, focusing on future earnings expectations. This could indicate confidence or analysis before the actual earnings report.

Putting it all together, tweets 1, 3, 6 provide general information across multiple stocks, which might show a broader market trend but not specific company news. Tweets 2 and 7 are more about upcoming earnings reports, indicating potential for positive or negative news based on what companies expect to do. The tweet with ""hod"" is particularly concerning as it's very positive, suggesting increased interest in certain sectors.

So, overall, the sentiment seems mixed. There are both positive tweets about upcoming earnings and some information that could indicate investor confidence or concern. However, the fact that tweet 2 mentions popular trends suggests a general bullish mood."
2015-10-27,Neutral,"Okay, let's see what I need to do here. The user has provided a list of tweets and asked me to determine their impact on the stock price of a given company. They've specified that the response should be either [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, I'll start by understanding each tweet one by one. But since all the tweets are about BABA (baba), maybe I can focus on those related to BABA. 

Looking at the tweets, a lot of them mention updates from AlphaCo, which is likely a competitor to BABA. For example, tweet 1 talks about stocks sliding and rite aid rising.Tweet 3 discusses earnings growth for AlphaCo. Tweets like 4 and 8 talk about revenue reports. So, these are all related to AlphaCo's financial performance.

Some tweets are about market insights or stock movements. Tweets 6 mentions a yohoo up nearly 6%, which could be from BABA relative to YOHOO. There are also mentions of big ticket buyouts and investments in mobile gaming on Yahoo Finance, which might indicate significant news for BABA's future.

I notice that multiple tweets are about AlphaCo's earnings or market trends, but there aren't any tweets directly talking about BABA itself except a few like tweet 6 where YOHOO is mentioned as beating RMB. But since YOHOO isn't a major competitor to BABA, maybe this is just mentioning another company.

Considering all the information: 
- AlphaCo's earnings are positive.
- There are mentions of stock movements (like tweet 2 and 3) but not explicitly stating if they're up or down.
- Big buyouts could indicate potential for growth but might also be a signal of expansion, which could lead to higher stock prices.

However, the tweets don't mention any direct info about BABA's performance, except that AlphaCo is doing well. So, while there are positive signs from AlphaCo and market reactions, it doesn't give a clear indication of BABA's own future earnings or fundamentals.

Putting this together, I think it leans more towards mixed but leaning positive because the company has strong financials from competitors. The buyout news could indicate expansion or acquisition plans which might lead to higher stock prices. However, without specific information about BABA's performance, it's hard to be certain.

So, considering all these factors, maybe the overall sentiment is [Neutral] since there's mixed data but positive trends emerging."
2015-10-28,Positive,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a set of tweets related to stocks and needs an analysis to determine their impact on the future stock price. They have specified that each tweet is evaluated in terms of positive, neutral, or negative.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the tweets, the words ""aapl"" and ""baba"" are present multiple times. In financial contexts, these often refer to stocks like Apple (AAPL) and BABA (which is a derivative used for hedging). Since the user hasn't provided specific stock symbols, I'll have to make an assumption here. Let's assume they're referring to Apple Inc. because it's a well-known company with a significant market impact.

Next, each tweet is analyzed individually. The goal is to separate positive and negative factors for each tweet and assess the sentiment on investor sentiment. Then, combine these analyses to determine the overall sentiment.

Let's go through each tweet one by one:

1. ""apple upgraded , alibaba pts hiked , twitter pts cut URL ibdnews via AT_USER $ aapl $ baba $ twtr $ nvs $ akam $ dnkn""

This tweet mentions that Apple and BABA stocks are up, while Twitter is cutting their price tag and updating something related to IBDNews. Since Apple is the target stock, this suggests positive news about it. So, this tweet contributes positively.

2. ""$ jd $ baba : don ’ t miss : URL inc . ( nasdaq : jd ) , encana corporation ( nyse … : URL""

This tweet is in Chinese and seems to be discussing whether to miss a trade on the Nasdaq or Encana Corporation. The mention of ""URL inc."" might indicate that this is related to a stock, possibly related to BABA. It's unclear if this is positive or negative without more context, but given the language and structure, it looks like an informational tweet about trading.

3. ""$ baba top news - oct 28th , 2015 $ baba URL""

This mentions BABA on October 28th, 2015. It doesn't provide details on whether there was a positive or negative event related to the stock. So, it's neutral.

4. ""jack ma got china goo goo for $ baba URL""

This tweet is quoting Jack Ma, who is known as a former Microsoft CEO, and mentions getting information about China related goods. It doesn't directly relate to BABA, so this seems like negative news because it refers to someone else's story rather than the company's performance.

5. ""$ baba : morgan stanley trims alibaba group holding target price to $ 98.70 … : URL""

This tweet is from M&G and mentions that BABA's stock is being trimmed by their target price. This directly affects investor sentiment, as it suggests that the stock might see a decrease in value. So, this contributes negatively.

6. ""URL bobirw : short 800 $ baba at 79.56 : bobirw URL URL""

This seems to be a shorting action on BABA by BobirW stock. Short selling can be seen as speculative but doesn't necessarily indicate a positive or negative trend for the company. It might imply increased interest in speculation, which could have mixed effects on stock price.

7. ""alibaba : singles day , earnings and outlook URL $ baba""

This tweet mentions Singles Day as an earnings announcement related to BABA. While this is good news from the company's perspective (as it affects future performance), it might not directly impact investor sentiment if the company faces other issues or challenges.

8. ""alibaba group holding limited upgrade by bank of america ( ranked 45th ) to buy $ baba baba URL""

This tweet says that BABA is being upgraded by Bank of America, which could positively influence stock price as it increases BABA's performance credit rating. So, this contributes positively.

9. ""rt AT_USER alibaba ’ s strong mobile signal should drowning out the noise from growth fears URL AT_USER $ baba htt …""

This tweet mentions that alibaba's strong mobile signals are expected to negate concerns about growth. It suggests that positive news will likely lead to a good outcome, which could be a good sign for BABA as it might attract more investors.

10. ""rt AT_USER us earnings tuesday : thoughts on alibaba , ups , coach URL $ baba $ ups $ coh URL""

This tweet is about earnings day in the US and mentions-ups and 'coach.' It doesn't specifically relate to BABA, so it's considered neutral or speculative.

Now, compiling these analyses: positive tweets include #4, #5, #8. Negative includes #3, #7, #10. Neutral includes #2 and #9. 

Considering the strong positive news about BABA from M&G and earnings announcements, and the speculative short selling which could indicate investor interest but not necessarily a trend, it's a bit challenging to decide between positive or neutral. However, given that there are significant positive developments (like earnings upgrades) related to BABA, and negative factors like Twitter cuts prices, the overall sentiment leans slightly positive but with some uncertainty from other events.

Given that the majority of tweets are either positive or neutral, it's reasonable to lean towards a positive overall sentiment because the good news about earnings and the strong mobile signals outweigh any negatives."
2015-10-29,Negative,"Okay, let's try to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on BABA stock. I'm not an expert in financial markets, but I'll do my best.

First, looking at each tweet individually might help me understand their potential effects. Let me go through them one by one.

The first tweet says ""great news for $ baba . more chinese consumers on the way . $ yhoo $ sftby URL."" It mentions Chinese consumers and potentially a rise in demand for BABA stock, which could indicate positive sentiment because it's about future growth. That might suggest a positive impact.

The second tweet is ""rgld royal gold , inc . bid size URL $ rgld $ myec $ baba $ acad rgld tradeideas stocksrock gibraltar steel corp . …"" It looks like the company is listed under tradeideas and is involved with steel companies, which could be related to industrial investments. However, without knowing if this leads to revenue or positive projects for BABA, it's hard to assess the impact.

Third tweet: ""rt optionalarmchat : free trial or acess to private $ twtr feed oaprivate $ gild $ tsla $ ibb $ fb $ bidu $ baba $ aapl $ googl $ amzn $ nflx $ lnkd $ pc …"" This seems like it's talking about a product or service, possibly related to options trading. It mentions free trials and private access, which might be a signal for investors, but without knowing how BABA reacts yet, I can't say much.

Fourth tweet: ""weekly research analysts ’ ratings updates for alibaba group holding $ baba URL acn."" This is about analyst ratings for Alibaba's stock. If the ratings go up or are positive, that could increase investor confidence and boost stock price. Conversely, if they go down, it might cause some fear.

Fifth tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ baba was called short by us in february before the collapse @ URL nyse china daytrading URL."" This seems negative because it mentions BABA being shorted and leading to a collapse. If this happened recently, it could indicate significant sell pressure on the stock, which would likely lead to a drop.

Sixth tweet: ""baba : short position $ baba URL ~ via URL."" Similar to the fifth, just repeats information about a short position but doesn't provide specifics on what caused it or its effect. It's ambiguous and hard to assess the impact without more context.

Now, summarizing each tweet:

1. Positive for future growth.
2. Indirectly involved in steel companies, possibly indirectly affecting stock.
3. Mentioned options trading product.
4. analyst ratings update, which could be positive if they're up.
5. Significant negative event about short selling leading to collapse.
6. Short position info without details.

Considering all these, the most significant factors are the positive news about consumers and possible future growth (1), indirect effects on steel companies (2), mention of options trading (3), and the big negative event with shorting leading to collapse (5). The analyst ratings (4) could be a mix but might not have a strong enough positive effect yet.

Putting it all together, I think the overall sentiment is mixed. There are both positive signs about future growth and some bad news from recent events. Without knowing how much each affects BABA's performance, it's hard to decide definitively. Maybe the impact isn't clear-cut."
2015-10-30,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on Amazon's stock price. So, first, I need to go through each tweet and extract relevant information.

Looking at the first tweet: "" bidu-weeklyta . $ amzn $ nflx $ uso $ baba $ aapl $ spy $ spx $ aa $ s $ v $ googl $ twtr $ usd $ xly $ xom $ scty $ eurusd $ uso $ vr … URL"". Hmm, I'm not sure what ""bidu-weeklyta"" refers to. Maybe it's a typo? Probably referring to something like ""baba"", which is the symbol for NVIDIA. So, this tweet says something about bidding weekly on NVIDIA and BABA (which might be a typo or different brand). It mentions ""black friday watch list before the market opened!"" I'm not sure how relevant that is to Amazon's stock.

Next tweet: ""called $ nflx and $ baba on black friday watch list before the market opened ! ! ! "" masterclass "" … URL"". So, they're calling out NVIDIA (NFLX) and BABA on Black Friday. Since Black Friday is a big shopping day for tech stocks, this could potentially lead to higher demand for these companies, which might boost Amazon's stock.

Third tweet: ""rt AT_USER jim 50 : baba gapped up +0.07 $ baba last price 82.71 day URL"". Here, Jim is reacting to BABA (probably NVIDIA), and he mentions that it has gapped up by 0.07 dollars with the last price at $82.71 on a certain ""day."" This seems like positive news about BABA's stock performance.

Now, I need to evaluate each tweet for positive or negative factors related to Amazon. From these tweets, NVIDIA (baba) and some mention of BABA's performance are present. There's no direct information about Amazon's financials or market position.

But since the user didn't provide a specific stock symbol from the tweets, I'm not sure if these tweets directly impact Amazon's stock. However, the second tweet talks about Black Friday and BABA, which might have some positive sentiment towards tech stocks during that time. The third tweet is more about Jim reacting to NVIDIA news.

Considering all this, while there are mentions of tech companies like NVIDIA and Black Friday trends, there's no direct information linking these to Amazon's stock. Therefore, it's hard to determine a clear overall sentiment for Amazon. Maybe the positive sentiments from BABA could suggest some underlying support, but without more context, I can't say for sure.

I think the best conclusion is that there are some positive signs about BABA during Black Friday, which might influence other companies like Amazon indirectly. But since there's no direct information on Amazon, it's neutral."
2015-10-31,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the company's stock price. The user provided two specific tweets and wants an analysis to determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative.

First, I'll identify the target stock in each tweet. 

Looking at the first tweet: ""san banco santander sa summary URL $ san $ ddd $ baba $ urbf san stockmarket tradeideas."" Hmm, the word ""baba"" seems to be a misspelling of ""BABA,"" which is a well-known stock symbol for Bank of America. The mention of San Francisco Stock Exchange and BABA suggests they're discussing something related to the BABA stock.

The second tweet: ""rt nasdaqfan : baba alibaba group holding ltd . last trade URL $ baba $ vnq $ gld $ rdsh baba stock finance."" Again, it mentions BABA. So both tweets are talking about BABA's stock price or market changes related to it.

Now, I need to analyze each tweet for positive and negative factors. But since I don't have specific data or context from the user or any external sources, I'll make some educated guesses based on common sentiments in financial news.

The first tweet is a bit confusing with several unrelated words mixed in, but ""san bank"" might be a typo for BABA. The mention of the San Francisco Stock Exchange and stock market trading ideas could indicate that people are interested in trading or observing stock movements, which might affect investor sentiment positively if they're seeing growth or positive news.

The second tweet is also about BABA. The terms like ""nasdaqfan"" (which I assume stands for network news) and ""last trade"" suggest recent market updates. If there's an increase in market activity or if the stock has seen some positive news, that could be a positive factor.

However, both tweets mention BABA but don't provide specific details about financial performance, earnings reports, industry trends, etc. Without concrete information, it's hard to assess definitively. But given that these are general comments and not tied to any specific event or report, the sentiment might remain neutral because there's no explicit indication of positive or negative news.

I should consider that without more context, it's best to assume a neutral stance since we don't have enough information about BABA's current performance or other related factors."
2015-11-01,Neutral,"Alright, so I have to figure out whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative regarding the stock market for a given company. The user provided two specific tweets and asked me to analyze their impact on the stock price's future.

First, let me break down each tweet one by one. 

Looking at tweet 1: ""ewy south korea ishares change URL $ ewy $ gs $ baba $ chb.to ewy finance financeewz brazil ishares message board …"". Hmm, I notice that the user mentions ""ishares,"" which I know stands for index or stock exchange. The presence of keywords like ""ks"" could indicate a specific sector, maybe KOSPI or an index in Korea. The URL seems to be pointing towards financial websites, so it might be news related to market updates or changes. It doesn't seem positive because the tweet is more promotional and informative about current events without explicit stock performance indicators.

Now, tweet 2: ""pbs powershares dynamic media portfolio last trade URL $ pbs $ sbux $ ayi $ baba pbs share tradeideaspcln …"". Again, I see ""baba"" mentioned, which is a stock symbol for BAA Corporation. This could be about their recent trades or news related to the company's performance. The mention of portfolio and media suggests it's about market trends affecting financial services. But since it's more about analysis of trading activities and not specific positive news from the stock itself, I'm leaning towards it being neutral. It doesn't provide a strong positive outlook on the stock but also isn't negative either.

Considering both tweets together: Tweet 1 is promotional without clear positives or negatives, while tweet 2 gives some context on BAA's activity in the market. They don't seem to indicate any specific trend that would affect the overall stock price positively or negatively. So, combining them, it seems like neither is strongly positive nor negative. Therefore, I should conclude neutral."
2015-11-02,Positive,"Okay, so I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the future stock price of a company. The user has provided 8 tweets and a target stock symbol, which isn't explicitly given. But based on the context, it seems like the stock mentioned is related to BABA or something similar.

Let me go through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions earnings next week and expects a 40-42 dollar increase before the earnings release. It also lists several ETFs and companies, including spy (Spy) which is an ETF tracking the S&P 500. This seems positive because it's indicating confidence in the company's future performance based on upcoming earnings.

2. The second tweet talks about AT_USER traders sharing cheat sheets on various financial websites like Facebook and others. That might be a promotional effort, possibly to attract more users or increase visibility. While this is an interesting trend, it doesn't directly mention any positive or negative stock action.

3. The third tweet mentions BABA being wary of Chinese companies entering into MSCI indexes. This sounds like a competitive move to get market attention and avoid dilution in the stock price. It's speculative but could lead to increased investor interest in the company.

4. The fourth tweet discusses cod . l compagnie de saint-gobain, which is part of BABA (BABA), the target company. This looks like a strategic mention or possibly a promotional signatory for some reason related to their operations. It's more about the company's name rather than immediate stock performance.

5. The fifth tweet talks about gear up for Chinese single-day events via AT_USER and mentions Amazon and Tesla. This seems like a positive event that could boost sales and earnings, potentially benefiting BABA if the company is a major player in the tech space or related to electronics companies.

6. The sixth tweet mentions the start of 2015 and includes stock ticker symbols like XLK, XNKE, etc., which are known for being attractive to many investors. This could indicate that the company might be performing well, so the sentiment is positive.

7. The seventh tweet says Facebook is bullish ahead of earnings, listing several tech companies including Google and BABA. Similar to tweet 5, it's a promotion related to future earnings, which can boost investor confidence for stock performance.

8. The eighth tweet lists googl (Google), FB (Facebook), BABA, amzn (Amazon), ntgr (NVIDIA; NVIDIA is the chip company), trip (Triton Technologies, which makes NTPU chips), and NFLX (which trades on the New York Stock Exchange). Again, this looks like a promotional or strategic mention that could influence investor sentiment positively.

Putting it all together: The first tweet gives specific earnings expectations with a high 52-week high. The third tweet is about being cautious of competitors, which could be a positive strategy if they're trying to maintain investor interest. The fourth tweet might not directly impact the stock but mentions another company. The fifth and seventh tweets are about upcoming events that can boost the company's performance. The sixth and eighth tweets talk about potential growth stocks.

Considering all these factors, there seems to be a mix of positive signals from earnings expectations, product launches (for BABA), strategic partnerships, and investment promotions. These could indicate a bullish overall sentiment."
2015-11-03,Negative,"Okay, so I have to analyze these tweets to determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative for a given company stock. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, the target stock is AlphaGroup holding ltd, with ticker symbol BABA. The tweets provided include some interesting stuff about the stock and other companies involved. My task is to look at each tweet, figure out positive factors related to BABA, negative factors, and how each tweet affects investor sentiment.

Looking at tweet 1: ""stock in focus - alibaba group holding ltd $ baba"". Hmm, this seems like a regular stock update about AlphaGroup. There's some financial data attached with quotes from different stocks, but I don't see anything specific related to BABA here. It might just be an informational tweet, so probably neutral.

Next is tweet 2: ""rt AT_USER notable opening imbalances : $ bac - 280k , $ baba - 82k , $ twtr - 55k , $ pfe - 43k , $ ge - 205k , $ jwn +74k , $ kors +79k , $ v +53k , $ h …"". This seems like a tweet from AT_USER, talking about notable open imbalance. I don't know much about this stock symbol, but if there's mention of imbalances and other companies, it might be related to BABA. But since the query is about BABA, not sure if this affects it. Maybe neutral.

Tweet 3: ""rt AT_USER the generation portfolio : reinvesting URL $ abr $ baba $ cys $ dis $ kmi $ ko $ pfe $ pg"". This one mentions a generation portfolio from AlphaGroup and some sectors like REIT (abr), IT (cys), defense (dis), financials (ko), financials (pfe), and pharma (pg). This is more about their investment portfolio and not directly related to BABA. So, probably neutral here.

Now, the output should conclude with one of [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Since none of these tweets specifically mention BABA except in tweet 1, which just seems like a stock update without any significant positive or negative info, I think the overall sentiment is neutral.

Wait, but in tweet 2, there are mentions of bac and baba. Maybe the user is discussing something about BABA's performance relative to others? If someone is talking about imbalances between funds, it could affect investor sentiment by making them doubt if their investment choices were better than others. That might cause some fear or uncertainty, which could be a negative impact.

But then again, unless there are specific mentions of gains or losses on BABA, I can't really say. If the user is just discussing other stocks, it's more about how the market is reacting to others rather than the stock itself. So maybe not enough info for a clear positive or negative.

I think overall, given that none of these tweets are directly related to BABA, and tweet 2 involves others but doesn't mention BABA in a significant way, the sentiment remains neutral."
2015-11-04,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out how the given tweets are likely affecting the stock price of a company, specifically [BABA]. Let me break down each tweet and see what they're saying.

First, the target is BABA. I should extract its symbol from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet: ""alibaba , URL in big cat fight ahead of singles day sale : $ baba $ jd URL via AT_USER"". Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Maybe it's split across lines or uses different symbols? Let me check again.

Wait, looking more carefully, I think the symbol is ""baba"" because the rest seems to be addressing BABA. So target stock is BABA, symbol: baba.

Now, analyzing each tweet:

1. alibaba , URL in big cat fight ahead of singles day sale : $ baba $ jd URL via AT_USER
   - This mentions that BABA is a big cat in a fight and has a sale on Singles Day, which is a marketing move to attract users. So, positive because it's about the company being involved and promoting sales.

2. rt AT_USER $ baba ( fwiw , at tl ) + 400k sh block / supply sold @ $ 85 stock only + 49 % since 9/29 also included short int . as of 10/15 URL
   - Positive factors: BABA is mentioned in the URL. They added a lot of shares and have a 49% increase. Negative factor: There's some crypto exchange rate (sh block) but it's speculative, which might not be good for investors.

3. URL superman trade alerts and premium research on top stocks ! students become millionaires ! $ evr $ manh $ dwre $ baba
   - Positive factors: BABA mentioned as a premium stock. Negative factor: The dollar prices are going to some unknown places, which is speculative and risky.

4. $ baba $ jd alibaba , URL in big cat fight ahead of singles day sale URL URL
   - Similar to the first tweet. It's promoting BABA with a sale, so positive sentiment.

5. $ baba going to break that $ 85 barrier today . $ 96 in sight for next week . Glad i added yesterday .
   - Positive factors: BABA is near an important price point and has potential growth momentum. Negative factor: The price target of $85 seems quite far, but it's a positive sign.

6. another great day for portfolio - $ fb earnings beat estimates :) up after-hours ! $ tsla $ amzn $ baba $ nflx $ lnkd $ ll $ twtr $ yhoo shine stocks
   - Positive factors: BABA is mentioned as part of the portfolio. Negative factor: Other companies like FB, TSLA, etc., have earnings results and positive stock names.

7. $ cntf updates from company ( real estate sales / leasing / spinoff ) w / earnings on tap later nov . * * positive cash * * flow $ ctrp $ baba AT_USER
   - Positive factors: They're talking about real estate or leasing and a possible spin-off, which might be good for growth. Negative factor: Unclear if the cash is flowing well.

8. morning buzzers : twitter ( twtr ) , oasis petroleum ( oas ) , dsw ( dsw ) , alibaba group ( baba ) URL $ baba
   - Positive factors: Mentioned stocks like TWTR, OAS, DSW, BABA. Negative factor: Twitter and OAS are speculative.

9. rt AT_USER $ baba was called short by us in february before the collapse @ URL nyse china daytrading URL

   Negative factors: The tweet suggests that BABA was shorted and it's about a potential collapse on the NYSE. This indicates negative news, which could be bad for investors.

Now, combining all these tweets. Positive tweets mention sales promotions, earnings, growth potential, and high stock prices. There are a couple of negative tweets about speculation, stock names, and investor sentiment. The overall sentiment seems positive due to strong promotional messages and good price targets but mixed with some speculative factors which might be risky.

Wait, though, there's one tweet that says ""negative news about potential collapse,"" so that could be significant. But other tweets are positive. It depends on how much weight each factor has. Given the context of a stock, even if it's speculative, the immediate promotion and high price targets could still influence the market positively.

So overall, considering the promotional messages and the price targets, the sentiment is [Positive]."
2015-11-05,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of the company. The user has given me three tweets, so I'll go through each one step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol: AT_USER. Wait, that doesn't look like a stock code. Maybe it's supposed to be something else? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding it. Hmm, maybe ""AT_USER"" isn't an official stock symbol, but it might refer to a specific company or a user account. For now, I'll assume the target is $BABA, which stands for Baidu App Store Business.

Now, analyzing each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet says: ""rt AT_USER $ baba was called short by us in february before the collapse @ URL nyse china daytrading URL"". So it's talking about a situation where BABA was shorted by the user before a collapse on NYSE and China DayTrading. This seems like negative news because there was an impact on investor sentiment and possibly leading to a drop.

2. The second tweet: ""$ baba.us alibaba in talks with sina on acquisition : the paper"". This mentions a meeting between Alibaba and sina, focusing on an acquisition deal. If there's a significant meeting on an acquisition, it could lead to positive news about future earnings, which might boost the stock price.

3. The third tweet: ""$ aapl $ blue $ feye $ baba $ fb gran comienzo de jornada , vamos por mas ! ! ! mas información en : ... URL"". It seems like it's saying there will be a meeting between Apple and FB, and they'll discuss something about the morning. This is positive because public announcements of product launches or partnerships usually boost stock performance.

Now, putting this together: The first tweet has negative news from a collapse, which could lead to a drop in price. The second suggests a possible acquisition, which might be seen as a good sign. The third explicitly mentions an announcement about FB, so that's definitely positive. Combining these factors—some bad news and some good—it seems like the overall sentiment is mixed but leans towards positive because of the specific mention of FB."
2015-11-06,Neutral,"Alright, I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company, which is Alibaba in this case. Let me break down the process step by step.

First, each tweet seems to be providing information about actions related to Alibaba, specifically mentioning deals and mergers or acquisitions. My task is to assess whether each tweet is positive, neutral, or negative in terms of sentiment towards the stock price.

Looking at tweet 1: It's a green light for Alibaba owns China's YouTube URL called BABA. The mention of $ baba indicates a potential increase in price because it looks like a stock name. So that's definitely positive.

Tweet 2 mentions a merger between Alibaba and Youku Tudou, which could imply that the company is expanding, but I don't have specific details on whether this benefits or hinders the stock. It's possible it doesn't directly impact the price as much as other tweets, so maybe neutral?

Tweet 3 talks about alibaba making a long position in great entry point and shorting at ms' secretive Miami conference. The mention of shorting might indicate uncertainty, which could lead to more volatile prices but also possibly neutral or slightly positive if investors are cautious.

Tweet 4 is from the user's tweet. It says they're shorting alibaba and related URLs. Short selling can sometimes be seen as speculative trading and might lead to price fluctuations but doesn't directly tell us much about the stock itself, so it's probably neutral.

Tweets 5 and 6 seem similar, listing a series of companies in a short position with a potential BABA outcome. Again, this is speculation without concrete information on how it affects the stock. Neutral is appropriate here.

Tweet 7 discusses a drug deal from astrazeneca but not directly related to Alibaba. It might be unrelated or have some side effects, but again, no direct impact on the stock price, so neutral makes sense.

Lastly, tweet 8 mentions an acquisition of China's YouTube, which could lead to increased revenue and possibly positive sentiment if this strategic move boosts Alibaba's market position.

Now, combining all these tweets, I notice that multiple of them suggest Alibaba might acquire or invest in other companies. This could either support a positive trend by expanding into new areas or be speculative, leading to some uncertainty. However, most tweets don't provide concrete information about specific movements but rather speculative trading activities.

Given the overall context of speculation and expansion without clear positive or negative indicators, I'm leaning towards a neutral sentiment. It might not have a significant long-term effect on the stock price, just potential moves that are hard to predict."
2015-11-07,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets and figure out if they're positive, neutral, or negative for astrazeneca's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

Starting with tweet 1: It mentions a drug deal with EMDR, which is an animal substance. That seems like bad news because it could hurt their reputation and earnings. So that's probably negative.

Tweet 2 talks about the market action forum for Tesla and Apple. I'm not sure what that means exactly, but if there are updates or discussions on these companies, it might influence investor sentiment. If people think they're undervalued, that could be positive. But since I don't have specifics, it's a bit tricky.

Tweet 3 is about BABA news on the 7th of November. BABA could be related to Tesla, so again, similar to tweet 2. Without more info, it's hard to say if this adds or subtracts from astrazeneca.

Tweet 4 discusses EUM stock and other companies like Alibaba. EUM is also known for its stock on the e-Commerce platform. If Alibaba is performing well there, that could be positive, but again, without knowing what's happening on e-commerce, it's uncertain.

Tweet 5 talks about shorting Alibaba (BABA) and going long on BABA. Shorting can lead to gains or losses depending on how the market reacts. This seems like a direct instruction from users, which might not have a clear effect yet.

Finally, tweet 6 is about Google and Tesla. Both are tech companies with potential for performance in their sectors. If these sectors are strong, it could boost astrazeneca's stock, but without knowing if Google or Tesla is up or down, it's vague.

Putting this all together, the main issues seem to be negative factors like the drug deal and EMDR on BABA. While there might be some positive tweets about e-commerce or tech stocks like Tesla, they don't directly relate to astrazeneca. So overall, the sentiment seems negative."
2015-11-08,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking through each tweet, none of them directly mention a specific stock name except maybe the first one where it says ""tesoro,"" which might be a typo for ""tesoro"" (Elton John), but that seems unrelated.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one and analyze their factors and sentiment impact. 

1. The first tweet mentions Chinese consumers liking good quality products, listing on baba next, and following. This seems like positive because it's talking about consumer preference and stock price updates, which could boost investor confidence.

2. The second tweet talks about PayPal holdings, ex-div date URL, and includes several stocks: pypl, baba, tna, lvs, etc., all related to stockmarket investment. While not directly a company stock, it's a high-level statement about the market sentiment, which could indicate concern or bullish overall.

3. The third tweet is an interview with Triforce Trading, listing several stocks including BABA and others. This seems like a financial analysis that might be informative but doesn't specify the impact on a particular stock's price directly.

4. The fourth tweet mentions Facebook and alibaba, discussing user competition. It says Facebook won, which could be seen as positive for Facebook's position but might not directly affect BABA unless there are stock-related details.

5. The fifth tweet talks about several stocks discussed in the market review, including Amzn and others. Similar to others, it's a broad statement without specific company information.

Putting this together, the main positive tweet is 1 which points towards good business fundamentals. Other tweets provide broader market insights but don't directly impact BABA's stock price as much. So overall sentiment seems positive."
2015-11-09,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, I have these tweets about different companies and their stock symbols. My task is to determine whether each tweet has a positive, neutral, or negative impact on the stock price of a given company. The user provided some examples, but they stopped after five tweets, so maybe the main focus here is on how to analyze them step by step.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet because that's crucial for evaluating their impact. Looking at the first few tweets:

1. ""rt AT_USER $ ddd recent news updated sunday , november 8 , 2015 9:07 : 05 pm $ mnst $ drv $ cdw $ baba URL""
Hmm, this one seems to be a Twitter user mentioning something about BABA stock on November 8th. But it's not clear what they're saying here.

2. ""ziop ziopharm oncology , inc . ideas URL $ ziop $ biib $ baba $ gld ziop stocks share""
This tweet is discussing ZIOP shares, focusing on their oncologyinc idea and stock prices with GILD.

3. ""amba ambarella , inc . short sales URL $ amba $ xom $ baba $ ssnc amba share shareamzn URL inc . …""
This one talks about AMBA shares, mentioning short sales and the company's performance relative to XOM (Xcelotis) and SBANAC.

4. ""amba ambarella , inc . short sales URL $ amba $ xom $ baba $ ssnc amba share shareamzn URL inc . …""
Same as tweet 3, so it's repeating the same information.

5. ""$ baba : alibaba group to ring new york stock exchange opening bell : URL""

This one is about BABA moving the NYSE opening bell by Albertou group. It seems like a positive announcement since they're planning to open the NYSE and it's their first move, which could indicate good news.

Now, considering each tweet:

- The user mentions BABA on November 8th (probably just context, not clear).
- ZIOP is discussed with oncologyinc ideas and stock shares.
- AMBA is talked about in two tweets with short sales relative to XOM and SBANAC.
- They also mention BABA planning the NYSE opening.

Given that each tweet contributes different information about various companies, it's challenging to assess a single impact on one company unless they overlap. But since the user hasn't provided a specific target stock, I'll have to make an assumption based on common themes.

BABA is being discussed in multiple tweets. The fifth tweet mentions BABA planning to open the NYSE, which could be a positive move. However, other tweets talk about ZIOP and AMBA, which are separate companies. Without knowing the target stock, it's hard to say exactly how these tweets impact that specific company.

But considering the overall context of positive announcements (opening the NYSE is always seen as significant), maybe BABA is being promoted here. However, other factors might influence investor sentiment too. Since the user can't determine which specific stock they're looking at, I'll have to make a general assessment based on overlapping information.

If BABA's next move is positive for their own growth or expansion, that could be seen as a positive factor. The NYSE opening is often expected, but sometimes companies are cautious about moving new exchanges just to capitalize. However, in this case, the user mentions ""alibaba group"" and plans the NYSE opening, which might suggest they're excited.

So, considering all these factors, I'll conclude that the overall sentiment is positive for BABA."
2015-11-10,Positive,"Okay, I need to determine the impact on the stock price for the given tweets about BABA. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I identify the target stock symbol. Looking through the tweets, I see ""baba"" mentioned a few times, so that must be the stock symbol: baba.

Next, I analyze each tweet as a factor. Each one seems to relate to BABA. Let me go through them one by one:

1. The first tweet mentions an upcoming IPO and some other stocks with dollar signs, maybe indicating value or interest in their performance. This could be positive because it's making investors think about potential growth.

2. The second tweet talks about a rate staying up and surpassing estimates. If the rate is rising, that might indicate confidence in the stock's strength, which is positive.

3. The third tweet mentions singles day in China but also suggests moving ahead with BABA. This seems like a forward-looking statement, indicating optimism about the company, so positive sentiment.

4. The fourth tweet mentions volume numbers and quotes for some stocks. High trading volumes can indicate strong sentiment, so positive.

5. The fifth tweet advises against buying $baba if there's an issue with transparency. It suggests caution, which is a negative factor because it reduces investor confidence in the stock price.

6. The sixth tweet mentions BABA holding, but talks about investing and other companies like JPMorgan and Kite. While this might indicate interest in BABA for investment reasons, it doesn't directly mention anything positive or negative about its performance.

Now, let me summarize each factor with sentiment:

1. Positive: Upcoming IPO and value stocks.
2. Positive: Rate increasing and confidence.
3. Positive: Forward-looking statement.
4. Positive: Trading volume.
5. Negative: Warning about transparency issues reducing confidence.
6. Neutral: Investment interest without performance indicators.

Looking at the factors, mostly are positive except for the fifth tweet which is negative. However, considering all factors together: some tweets suggest strong movements (upcoming IPO), while others indicate caution (transparency warning). 

I should consider whether these opposing signals balance out. If several tweets provide optimistic outlooks and fewer are critical warnings, it might lean more positive. Conversely, if there's a dominant negative factor, it could pull the stock down.

So overall, despite some negative factors, the majority of the tweets suggest strong potential or cautious considerations. This makes me lean towards a positive sentiment because even with a minor warning, multiple positive signals dominate."
2015-11-11,Negative,"Okay, I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. The user has given me several tweets and wants me to analyze them step by step.

First, from each tweet, I have to identify the target stock symbol. Then, for each tweet, I separate positive and negative factors. Each positive factor would boost investor sentiment, while negative factors might reduce it. After assessing the sentiment in each tweet, I need to combine them to get an overall sentiment.

Looking at the tweets:

1. The first tweet seems general, mentioning several indices but doesn't specify a particular stock.
2. Second tweet also mentions multiple stocks but again no target specified.
3. Third and fourth tweets mention $baba without specifying the stock.
4-6: Still too broad; each has multiple stocks but not clearly indicating an action on a specific company.

However, the last few tweets mention $baba:

7. ""Chinese singles day explained in two minutes"" - Maybe some action related to technology or tech companies.
8. ""great comps to drive the point"" - Positive sentiment as it's about diversification.
9. ""jack ma : our active online users are bigger than the population of the u . s."" - Positive, mentions a person who is well-known in tech.
10. ""down 2 % on a day they made $14 billion in sales . in case you needed a reminder kids , always sell the news"" - Negative sentiment about financial performance and advice to not give young people money for fun.
11. ""happy singles ' day ! so far $5b was spent in 90 minutes on URL $ baba URL URL""
- Positive, mentions spending money.
12. ""now AT_USER $ baba's jack ma : i want to retire early . not to enjoy my life but to give young people the opportunity to run the company.""
- Positive as it expresses a retirement plan.

The first 5 tweets don't specify an action on any stock and don't mention specific targets. The last five tweets are about $baba, with mixed sentiments based on whether they're positive or negative regarding performance or action.

Putting this together: There's some positive tweet (9), more positive (10, 12, 14), but a negative tweet (10). It's unclear if these are all about the same stock. Since it's too broad to determine the exact company, it's hard to assess the overall impact on any specific stock.

So, without knowing which stock or its relation to the tweets, I can't definitively say positive, neutral, or negative."
2015-11-12,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on a company's stock price and determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative.

First, looking at tweet 1, it mentions alibaba roars and mentions jd andu. That sounds good, so that's a positive sign.

Next, tweet 2 is about APEX with a bunch of stocks listed on the $baba URL. This shows interest in investing in various companies, which is a positive trend.

Tweet 3 talks about the bearish case on BABA halte report, implying strong reports but negative sentiment overall. So some investors are concerned about BABA, which could be neutral or slightly negative.

Tweet 4 mentions the price target being raised to $98 from $89 at deura bank. That's a buy action, so that adds to confidence and positive sentiment.

Tweet 5 talks about alibaba's stock dropping but claiming it's because of Singles Day despite having a record day. This is a bit contradictory, but if the record was strong, it might not be negative, just cautious optimism, which is neutral.

Tweet 6 also mentions APEX on Black Friday and online buying days surpassing that. Again, positive news for investors, so this boosts sentiment positively.

Tweet 7 is about Zbra and others on their nasdaq trades. While interesting, without specific info on the company's performance, it might be considered neutral as it doesn't directly affect stock prices unless there are specifics missing.

Overall, tweets 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 all have positive elements, some in the strong and others cautious but not negative. Tweet 3 is mixed, but with a focus on BABA, it's more likely to be slightly negative. However, considering that singles day was record-breaking and APEX is about Black Friday, which are strong events, maybe tweet 3 is still positive.

I think the overall sentiment leans towards positive because the main positive tweets outweigh the mixed one."
2015-11-13,Negative,"Okay, let's try to figure out the impact of these tweets on BABA's stock price. So, the first thing is to extract the target stock from each tweet.

1. The first tweet says ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . e . p . s . URL $ baba $ imsc $ ort.to $ cvx baba investing investing."" From this, it looks like the stock symbol is BABA. 

2. The second tweet mentions FVEX, MMBA, and others, but I'm not sure about the exact stock here—probably another one.

3. Third tweet: ""alibaba group : time to pause international expansion URL $ baba URL."" Again, seems like BABA as the target.

4. Fourth tweet: ""gucci , ysl , others suing alibaba back down on mediation threat URL $ baba."" This mentions GUCI and YSL, so maybe another stock.

5. Fifth tweet: ""$ spy avxl $ baba $ aapl the only curse is the curse on the ugly tout URL"" – here, BABA and SPY (which I think is SPDR.BA) are mentioned.

6. Sixth tweet: ""baba i think baba should be trading at $ 95 based on the recent earnings report , singles day sales and eps and huge potential with this stock."" This clearly mentions BABA as the target stock, which is trading at $95.

Now, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. Let's see:

1. Positive: The URL suggests it's a holding company. Maybe they're expanding or looking towards international expansion.
2. Negative: The "" pause international expansion"" seems like a negative factor because it might slow down growth.
3. Positive: BABA is mentioned in the context of selling mediation threats, which could be positive for investors.
4. Negative: GUCI and YSL are likely competitors or may face competition.
5. Positive: Both BABA and SPY are discussed, which have potential as tech stocks.
6. Positive: The tweet suggests trading at $95, indicating a strong outlook.

Next, assessing sentiment by analyzing each factor's impact:

1. The expansion pause could be either positive or negative depending on the context of their expansion.
2. Competitors' actions might be seen as either good or bad.
3. Mediation threat selling indicates potential downside risk.
4. Strong outlook at $95 suggests optimism.

Looking for a balance: Positive and Negative factors are present, but the overall trend seems positive because the stock is trading relatively high and there's some potential from SPY. The mention of GUCI and YSL as competitors could mitigate negative impacts if they face competition, but not sure about their position yet."
2015-11-14,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for the given company.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at each tweet:

1. ""rt AT_USER chinese adrs : index inclusion a key catalyst URL $ baba $ bidu $ ctrp $ edu $ jd $ ntes $ xrs"" – This seems like it's related to a company called AT_USER, which is probably a brand or project name.
2. ""goog alphabet inc . summary URL $ goog $ eum $ eqlb $ baba goog invest invest"" – This mentions Google Alphabet and includes the stock ticker for BABA. So, I think BABA is the target stock here.
3. ""trp.to the travelers cos . , inc . company info URL $ trp.to $ baba $ efa $ bx trp.to pennystocks stockmarket"" – This also includes BABA.
4. ""tna direxion daily small cap bull 3x shares URL $ tna $ dia $ baba $ qid tna share pennystocks"" – Again, BABA is mentioned.

Okay, so BABA seems to be the focus of these tweets. Now, I need to analyze each tweet for Positive, Neutral, or Negative factors and assess sentiment towards the stock price.

Looking at tweet 1: ""index inclusion a key catalyst URL..."" It mentions an index being included as a catalyst, which could mean it's good news for the company. So positive factor here.

Tweet 2: ""summary URL $ goog ... invest."" The presence of Google Alphabet (GOOGL) is in there, and investment keywords like ""invest"" are mentioned. This might suggest that investors have confidence or interest in BABA, which could be positive for stock performance.

Tweet 3: ""company info URL trp.to ... pennystocks."" Again, BABA is involved here with a mention of the pennystocks stock market. This indicates another good news angle for BABA.

 Tweet 4: ""directional words bull shares,"" along with BABA and QID. Directionality like 'bull' might imply positive trends or expectations, so this adds to a positive sentiment.

Now, looking at the overall sentiment summary:

Positive factors include index inclusion, Google Alphabet investment, company info on pennystocks, and directional language. Negative factors don't seem to be mentioned here.

Therefore, combining these positive points, the stock is likely to have a Positive overall sentiment."
2015-11-15,Neutral,"Alright, I need to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price of a company based on the given information. Let me break it down.

First, each tweet is about a new stock pick site. The links are FB ( Facebook ), LF ( Lululetra ), and LNK ( Netflx ). Hmm, those seem like companies in the consumer electronics or fitness sector. Maybe they're related to something else entirely, but I don't have specific information.

Looking at the first tweet: ""Interesting article about a new stock pick site."" The user is mentioning a new service or platform for stocks. It's neutral because it doesn't specify if it's positive, negative, or neutral towards the company.

The other tweets are all links to the same companies: FB, LF, LNK. I don't know anything specific about these companies from my knowledge cutoff in October 2023. They might be startups or established, but without more context, it's hard to assess their impact on stock price.

Since none of the tweets provide positive or negative information about the company, and only the links are given, I can't determine if any tweet contributes positively or negatively. Therefore, all the tweets are neutral in terms of their sentiment towards the stock."
2015-11-16,Neutral,"Alright, let's analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of the given company.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. It seems like they're all related to ETFs and options trading, so the stocks involved are probably SPY (Spy), FB (FB), AALUSTRATE (AWL) which is an ETF, TSLA (Tesla), NFLX (NY Eagle), GDX (GDAXI), BABA (Barclays Base Open Index), etc.

Now, looking at the tweets one by one:

1. The first tweet mentions scanning for doubles on various ETFs and their URLs. It's a general mention of multiple symbols without specific details about any company. So this is just general information not pointing to a specific stock.

2. The second tweet talks about filings updated on November 15, 2015, with specific dates and symbols like PCLN (Proton Creative), UGAZ (Umeda), etc. This seems more about regulatory updates or market data, again not identifying a specific ETF or company's stock.

3. The third tweet is similar to the first one but mentions scanning for doubles on different ETFs. Again, it's general information without targeting any particular stock.

4. The fourth tweet uses AT_USER pronouns and mentions highly traded options with several ETFs: SPY (Spy), FB (FB), AWL, AMZN, NFLX, etc. This is again a list of symbols but not specifying which one the user is referring to or what market they're in.

Since all tweets are providing general information about ETFs and their related markets without targeting any specific company's stock price, I can't determine a positive, negative, or neutral impact on the stock price. There's no mention of news that would affect these stocks positively, negatively, or neutrally."
2015-11-17,Negative,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company and figure out if it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me start by breaking down each tweet.

First, the user is looking at two companies: BABA (Baba Inc.) and APL (iwm). The first tweet mentions a credit spread called ""baba call credit spread."" I'm not too familiar with financial strategies like that, but maybe it's related to hedging or risk management. The user seems interested in an uptrend continuing here. That could mean they're looking for stability or growth.

The second tweet looks for doubles between several stock symbols. Double plays are common in trading, especially in pairs trades where two stocks move together. So the user is actively searching for double plays across multiple companies like spy (SPY), iwm, aapl, dia, gdx, etc. This could indicate interest in index arbitrage or spread trading strategies.

The third tweet says ""dam baba killing it,"" which sounds like aggressive selling pressure on BABA. They're selling off shares, maybe due to fear of loss or a strong fundamentalist position.

The fourth tweet mentions gold as a dividend-paying stock. The user is investing in gold and has information about its dividends: $gg, dnrg, ggal. Dividend stocks can be a hedge against inflation. The user might be looking for income generating assets.

Now, putting this together. BABA could be involved in trading strategies or being sold due to selling pressure. The other companies are part of index arbitrage and dividend investments. Each tweet is focusing on different aspects: credit spreads (which might indicate interest rate changes affecting BABA's value), double plays (suggesting a strategy for price movement), selling sentiment, and income stocks.

But without knowing the stock's current position relative to these investments, it's hard to gauge their impact on the stock itself. However, considering the tweet about selling shares (""dam baba killing it"") and other positive mentions of gold as a dividend source, there might be some support for BABA due to the selling pressure.

But wait, if the user is selling shares of BABA (BABA), that would indicate negative sentiment towards their stock. However, they're also investing in gold, which could have its own implications. If the price of gold is undervalued and expected to rise, it might be seen as a hedge against inflation or an asset class in consideration.

So overall, while there are positive elements like selling shares and dividend income, the negative tweet about BABA's share price support might weigh more. However, without knowing the relative strength of these investments, it's ambiguous. But considering that investors often look for growth and safety before trading stocks, maybe some positivity is present due to potential future gains from gold or other factors.

But honestly, it's hard to determine the overall sentiment based on this limited information. It seems like BABA is under pressure but also there are other investment opportunities. Maybe the positive elements offset the negative? I'm not sure. But since one of the tweets explicitly mentions selling shares, that could be a strong negative."
2015-11-18,Neutral,"Alright, so I'm trying to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided four tweets and wants me to assess each one as either Positive, Neutral, or Negative, then combine them into an overall sentiment.

First, let me list out each tweet carefully:

1. ""why mark zuckerberg gave this teenager $ 400,000 URL $ fb $ goog $ baba award science tech""
2. ""baba $ baba URL""
3. ""ctix cellceutix corp . last trade URL $ ctix $ baba $ smh $ blta ctix stocks stocks""
4. ""shunning protocol , obama interviews alibaba billionaire ma URL $ baba""

Okay, starting with the first tweet: ""Why Mark Zuckerberg gave this teenager $400,000 award for science tech."" Hmm, I'm not sure what's being said here. Zuckerberg is known for his work in tech and investing, but giving an award to a teen seems odd. It might be a joke or a humorous statement rather than a positive or negative indicator of stock performance.

Moving on to the second tweet: ""Baba $ BABA URL."" I recall that BABA stands for Borsa Borsa Astri, which is the benchmark index in India's stock market. It seems like the user is mentioning a specific stock. If this is an update or price move related to BABA, it might affect investor sentiment if there are positive news about BABA or negative about its performance.

The third tweet: ""CTIX Cellceutix corp . Last trade URL $ CTIX $ BABA $ SMH $ BLTA CTIX stocks stocks."" This looks like a list of stock names. The mention of CTIX, which I think is a mutual fund provider, and the keywords ""smh"" (something wrong with my internet connection?) and ""blta"" (maybe a typo for BLTE Corporation?), suggests that this tweet might be related to some event or news about these stocks.

The fourth tweet: ""Shunning Protocol, Obama Interviews Alibaba Billionaire Ma URL $ BABA."" This seems like an update from the White House or a media outlet. Shunning Protocol could refer to a policy change, and interviews with individuals on Wall Street, especially someone like Ma (who I believe is Steve Ballmer), might indicate external news impacting BABA. But without more context, it's hard to say if this is positive or negative.

Now, considering each tweet:

1. The first one doesn't seem to relate directly to the company, so probably neutral.
2. The second tweet mentions a stock but I'm not sure about its current state—maybe positive, negative, or neutral based on recent news.
3. The third tweet is a bit confusing due to the typo and unknown keywords, which might indicate speculative information related to stocks.
4. The fourth tweet could be positive if it's reporting significant external events impacting the company, but without more context, I'm not certain.

Putting this together, the first tweet is neutral, the others are uncertain but possibly negative or neutral since they don't directly relate. However, considering the third tweet has some uncertainty and speculative content, it might lean towards neutral as well. The second tweet could be positive if BABA's performance is favorable, but without specific info, I'll consider it neutral.

So overall sentiment-wise, with three neutrals and one uncertain negative (since it's a joke or not directly related), the stock might remain neutral."
2015-11-19,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about the stock price of S&P 500 ETFs like VIX and SPX. The user provided three tweets, and I need to determine if each one is positive, negative, or neutral in impact.

Starting with the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER sentishiftdown $ uup $ celg $ baba $ atvi $ vxx fintech finserv URL 2015111 9-09 : 25"". Hmm, the word ""sentishiftdown"" seems a bit jumbled. It might be a typo or some misspelling of ""shortsided""? So I think this tweet is talking about something related to short selling on VIX and FINSERV. The mention of fintech could imply some positive change in the tech sector, which often impacts financial ETFs. However, since it's talking about short selling, which can lead to losses if not managed properly, but without more context, I'm leaning towards a neutral sentiment because it might be cautious or providing information that affects the market.

Moving on to the second tweet: ""sgy.to surge energy inc . short sales URL $ sgy.to $ mcd $ baba $ zts sgy.to stockmarket stocks"". Here, SGRY is likely an ETF symbol. The text mentions ""short sales"" and ""(stockmarket stocks)"", which could indicate investor sentiment towards the company. Short selling can sometimes be a risk-reward maneuver, so if it's done cautiously by investors, it might not have a huge impact on the stock price. It seems to be providing some information about short positions but doesn't make a strong claim or comment.

The third tweet: ""rt AT_USER breaking : activist hedge fund starboard value asks yahoo $ yhoo to sell its internet business and not spin off $ baba htt …"". The phrase ""starboard"" likely means ""on top of,"" so the tweet is probably saying that an activist hedge fund wants to sell their investments on Yahoo (YHOO) and avoid spinning off their assets. This seems like a direct request for selling, which can lead to market volatility. If this sentiment spreads or if other investors notice it, it could cause the stock price to drop. The mention of ""hedge funds"" adding some negative sentiment because they often engage in risky activities that can affect overall market performance.

Putting it all together: The first tweet might be neutral as it's about short selling and tech sector info without major news. The second is also probably neutral since it's providing short position information without strong implications. The third clearly states an action, which could lead to negative sentiment if not acted upon or if the hedge fund's actions are seen as manipulative. However, sometimes these short positions can be managed, so there might still be a mix of positive and negative aspects.

But considering that some tweets might indicate concerns about the company's financial health without clear direction, I think it leans towards neutral overall."
2015-11-20,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided seven tweets and asked me to determine if each is positive, neutral, or negative. 

First, I need to identify which tweet refers to a specific stock. Looking at the first tweet: ""tradewithjoe : scanning for doubles - URL $ spy $ iwm $ aapl $ dia $ gdx $ baba $ fb $ nflx $ googl $ tsla $ uvxy $ bidu $ yhoo $ uso …"". It doesn't specify which stock, so I might have to make an assumption. Maybe it's Alphabet (GOOGL) since that's the most common one in this context.

Next, I need to break down each tweet for positive and negative factors. But wait, some tweets just have URLs without context. For example, ""rt AT_USER $ fxe last price updated friday , november 20 , 2015 12:11 : 02 pm $ uso $ ome $ baba $ svxy URL"" seems to be about the price of US Dollar (USD) which affects the stock's value. That could be positive or negative depending on whether the USD is expected to rise or fall.

But without specific context, it's tricky. I should consider that ""baba"" and ""fne"" might refer to specific stocks, but again, this is speculative. Similarly, tweets like ""rt URL fan firsttrust global wind energy etf change URL $ fan $ crm $ psx $ baba fan invest trade ..."" are about a ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund), which could affect the stock price negatively if the ETF's performance is not favorable.

However, without clear information on each tweet's context or specific stocks involved, it's challenging to assess their impact. Maybe I should consider trends in the last few tweets. For instance, the one with ""$ fxe"" might relate to currency fluctuations, which can be either positive or negative based on the expected economic environment.

I think a better approach is to consider common sentiment indicators. If there are multiple posts about positive news related to the stock, it leans towards a Positive sentiment. Conversely, if they're all negative, it's Negative. But without knowing exactly what each tweet is about regarding the target stock, I can't be certain.

Given that some tweets are speculative or context-free, I might end up making an educated guess based on trends in related topics. For example, if there's a lot of positive news about the USD exchange rate related to GDX, it could indicate a Positive sentiment for Alphabet. But again, this is all uncertain without more information.

I'll have to go with the assumption that I need to make the best possible conclusion based on the available data and trends. So, in this case, since some tweets mention specific stocks or unrelated topics like ETFs, the overall sentiment might be Neutral because it's not clear whether it's positive, negative, or neutral."
2015-11-21,Negative,"Okay, I need to figure out how these tweets impact the stock price of a company. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually.

First, the list of tweets includes some URLs and mentions that include ""stockmarket stocks finance money."" That seems pretty generic, so maybe those are just placeholders or irrelevant links. I'll ignore them since they don't provide specific information about the stock performance.

Looking at the first tweet: It lists several stocks for a week from 11/23 to 11/27. The words ""stockmarket"" and ""finance money"" again don't give any actionable insights here. It's more of a market overview without specific predictions or analysis.

The second tweet mentions GOOGL, ALPHABET, PBAR, and TNA, along with their open prices. Again, it's another list of financial terms without any predictions or analysis. It doesn't provide information about the stock price movement but rather details about the company itself.

Now, focusing on ""stockmarket stocks finance money."" The user said to conclude with one of [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. But I only see two tweets that mention these topics. Since there's no specific information in either tweet predicting how these stocks will perform, it's hard to determine the sentiment. They might be making a general statement about stock markets without providing any analysis.

Therefore, with insufficient information on how these tweets relate to the actual stock performance of the company, I can't assess whether the impact is positive, neutral, or negative."
2015-11-22,Negative,"Alright, I'm going to analyze these tweets about the stock exuTo. The first tweet is ""exe.to extendicare inc . short sales URL $ exe.to $usage $ko $baba exe.to stock stock."" Hmm, that seems a bit off-topic. It mentions extending Medicare Inc., which is a medical company, and lists some exchange rates but doesn't talk about the company's financial performance or anything related to their stocks. It's more of a business announcement than an investment recommendation.

So, since this tweet isn't directly related to the stock exuTo, it probably doesn't have any impact on their future stock price. There are no positive, neutral, or negative factors here that would influence the company's performance. The content is about financial metrics and not the stock itself. Therefore, this tweet contributes nothing to determining whether the stock will go up, stay the same, or down.

I'll conclude that it has a [Negative] impact because it's about the business rather than the stock."
2015-11-23,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze how these tweets are affecting the stock price of the given company based on their impact. The user provided specific steps and an example output, so I'll follow those closely.

First, I'll identify each tweet's target stock symbol. From the tweets:

1. Dust Daily Gold Miners
2. Stz constellation brands , Inc.
3. Tan Guggenheim Solar
4. Baba Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.
5. GE (General Electric)
6. BABA (Baba Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.)
7. SVXY (Proshares Short VIX)

Wait, some of these are the same companies. Let me confirm:

- Dust Daily Gold Miners is separate.
- Stz constellation brands , Inc. seems like a company name.
- Tan Guggenheim Solar
- BABA is Baba Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which has several tweets.
- GE is General Electric, and SVXY is part of Proshares.

Next step: Separate factors into positive and negative. But looking at the tweets provided, each tweet includes some financial indicators but not all are directly about stock performance. For example, ""dust direcxt daily gold miners bear 3x shares summary URL dust dust $ jcp $ baba $ xrt dust..."" It mentions that dust is bearish on gold miners and shares, which could affect the stock price of Dust Daily Gold Miners.

Similarly, ""stz constellation brands , inc . volume URL stz ibb $ baba ..."" mentions volume but doesn't specify whether it's bullish or bearish. ""Tan Guggenheim Solar"" refers to an ETF, so that might be a positive point if they have strong earnings.

""Baba Alibaba Group Holding Ltd."" tweets like these are usually good for the stock because BABA is a leading technology company. The tweet about GE being updated says there's a 9.59% change on Nov 22, 2015. That might indicate some event affecting the market, which could impact BABA.

SVXY is related to the VIX index, which affects stock prices because it affects volatility. A tweet with ""short sales"" and ""trade ideas stocks"" suggests investors are shorting or thinking about buying stocks that are volatile, which could affect SVXY's price.

Now, assessing sentiment for each company:

1. Dust Daily Gold Miners: The tweet mentions gold miners bearish and shares bearish. If gold is a factor in stock performance (gold is an asset, but more often with bonds), but gold might not directly impact energy stocks. However, the sentiment here could be mixed.

2. Stz constellation brands , Inc.: Volume mentioned but no specific trend. It's hard to tell if it's bullish or bearish without more info.

3. Tan Guggenheim Solar: The tweet says ""share share,"" which is neutral. Maybe a mix of positive and negative from the ETF, not sure about sentiment.

4. BABA (Baba Alibaba Group Holding Ltd): The tweet mentions EOD data with GAAP numbers and financial indicators but no clear trend. It's generally a good sign for tech stocks, so maybe positive.

5. GE: The tweet is about a market update with a volume number. Sometimes companies' stock prices can react to earnings reports or other news. If there was an earnings announcement around that date, it could impact the price.

6. BABA again: Same as above, just different wording. Volume unspecified, so not sure about sentiment.

7. SVXY: Short sales are often bad for investors because they reduce their exposure and might drive prices up due to fear of loss. But some short sellers can indicate bearish trends, but without more context, it's hard to say.

Putting it all together, some tweets provide positive factors, others are about market conditions or company performance that aren't as clear. For example, BABA is leading in tech, which usually helps its stock. GE might have an earnings report effect on the market. SVXY could be influenced by short selling sentiment, but without specific info.

However, since some tweets don't provide sufficient information to determine a clear positive or negative trend, it's safer to consider the overall trend from significant positive factors. BABA being in the mix is strong for tech and likely to be seen as a positive sign. GE's earnings report could impact the market, but without knowing if they're up or down, it's uncertain.

So, combining these thoughts, I'd say the stock might have some positive momentum due to leading companies like BABA, but other factors could cause some volatility."
2015-11-24,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets regarding their impact on the stock price of the given company. The user has provided three tweets and I need to determine whether they are positive, neutral, or negative in terms of their expected impact.

First, I should identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at them:

1. ""$ baba when it falls i will add to my position . waiting for rally in december .""
   - The stock symbol here is BABA. It's a common abbreviation for BetaShares, which is a well-known investment company.

2. ""rt AT_USER erx direxion daily energy bull 3x shares bid URL $ erx $ lulu $ baba $ bib erx share investing""
   - This tweet mentions ERX, which I believe stands for Exponential Moving Average (EMA). It's a technical indicator used in trading.

3. ""$ early movers : tif , hrl , dsw , pmcs , dltr & more $ tif $ baba $ scie $ dlta $ f URL""
   - This tweet lists companies under the ""early movers"" category, including TIF, HRL, DSW, PMCS, and DLTR. These are all financial services companies.

Now, I need to analyze each tweet's factors and sentiment towards investor sentiment.

Starting with the first tweet: ""$ baba when it falls i will add to my position . waiting for rally in december .""
- The tweet suggests that if BABA falls, the user will buy more shares. It indicates a positive outlook on buying when conditions improve (recovery in December). This seems like a买入 signal.

The second tweet is ""rt AT_USER erx direxion daily energy bull 3x shares bid URL $ erx $ lulu $ baba $ bib erx share investing.""
- ERX, EMA, and BABA are all mentioned. ERX being bullish suggests that the stock might go up, which would be a positive indicator for investors.

The third tweet: ""$ early movers : tif , hrl , dsw , pmcs , dltr & more $ tif $ baba $ scie $ dlta $ f URL""
- It lists several EMA companies and mentions ERX. The idea here is that these companies are expected to increase their holdings in the stock market. This could indicate good news for BABA, making it seem positive.

Putting this together:

1. First tweet: Suggests买入 after a rally.
2. Second tweet: ERX bullish signals upward potential.
3. Third tweet: Expecting gains from EMA companies, which are related to BABA.

All these tweets are pointing towards the stock BABA either being expected to rise or have strong support among investors. There's no negative talk here; instead, all mentions are positive about future growth and potential increases. Therefore, the overall sentiment is likely positive."
2015-11-25,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of BABA. So, first, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet, it mentions ""baba"" and talks about an updated chart with ratings for the stock. That seems clear—BABA is the stock we're looking at.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one to break them down into Positive (P) and Negative (N) factors. 

For the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ baba updated chart . maintaining o / w rating with 105-107 pt . barrons ... you blew it . ( again ) AT_USER AT_USER URL."" Here, I see mentions of ratings, a Barron's update, and repeated ""blipped"" which probably means the stock has been mentioned multiple times. The positive points here are the rating improvement from 105-107 and the Barron's update, so that should be P.

Moving on to tweet two: ""itub russell 2000 ishares financials URL $ itub $ exls $ eum $ baba itub share tradeideas."" The word ""itub"" might refer to Russell 2000 or some other index. The mention of financials and shares, along with the URL, indicates an interest in the stock's performance or future direction. Since there aren't explicit positive or negative mentions here, I'll consider it neutral.

The third tweet: ""AT_USER great news for anybody long $ baba and their 300 separate operating companies . does the company even know what's going on ?"" This one has a lot of questions like ""does the company even know what's going on?"" which suggests uncertainty, possibly negative. The mention of multiple companies also adds to the uncertainty around BABA's situation.

The fourth tweet: ""good morning . futures looking up ... our trades gappppping up ! ! ! 100 % again today ! ! ! $ googl nflx $ aapl $ baba $ amba URL."" Here, it talks about futures prices going up and mentions several stocks. While there's some positive info on the futures aspect, there are speculative elements and multiple companies mentioned without explicit sentiment indicators. It seems more like a continuation of market activity than a definitive rating.

Putting this together: Positive tweets (1) show improving ratings and news, Negative tweet (3) suggests uncertainty, and Neutral (2 and 4) indicate mixed views. However, the positive factors are strong enough to outweigh the negative aspects. So overall, I'd say it's [Positive]."
2015-11-26,Neutral,"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I have a set of tweets provided, and my goal is to determine their impact on a given company's stock price. The user has already outlined a process that includes identifying the target stock symbol and analyzing each tweet from a positive, negative, or neutral perspective.

First, looking at the tweets:

1. $ gm $ aapl $ baba $ bac $ cvx $ t URL URL

Hmm, wait a minute. I notice that these tweets are all starting with '$' signs followed by different stock symbols like 'gm', 'aapl', etc. But in reality, stock symbols typically start with a letter and sometimes include numbers or underscores. For example, ' gm $ gm' doesn't make sense as a stock symbol. That makes me think maybe there's some confusion here.

Also, I see the terms ""t URL URL"" which don't seem to relate to stock prices. It looks like the user might have made a typo or something is missing in the tweets provided. Since all these tweets start with $ and then have various symbols, it's unclear if they're individual stock price updates or part of a larger tweet that needs context.

Given this confusion, I can't accurately analyze each tweet to determine their impact on the stock price because I don't have the necessary information about what is being said. Without knowing which specific stock each tweet refers to and how they affect it, it's impossible to evaluate the sentiment. 

I remember that in the initial response, I concluded ""[Neutral]"" without any further analysis, but now with this confusion, I should note that my previous answer might not be correct. Perhaps the user can clarify or provide more context so that I can accurately assess each tweet and determine the overall impact on the stock price.

In summary, the main issues here are misinterpretation of stock symbols, missing information about which tweets affect specific stocks, and the ""t URL URL"" part which doesn't add to the stock analysis. Without resolving this ambiguity, my earlier conclusion remains ungrounded."
2015-11-27,Missing,File not found
2015-11-28,Neutral,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze the impact on stock price based on the provided tweets. The user gave me four tweets and wants an analysis on their likely effect on a company's future stock price.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the tweets:

1. ""gt goodyear tire & rubber co . p / e ratio URL $ gt $ jnk $ baba $ gm gt stocks pennystocks""

Hmm, it seems like 'gt goodyear tire & rubber co.' is the stock symbol. I should note that in my analysis.

Next step: Separate each tweet into Positive and Negative factors. But wait, some of these tweets are just URLs and don't provide any information about their content or sentiment. That could be a problem because without context from other sources, it's hard to assess their impact.

Looking at the rest:

2. "" gt $ jnk $ baba $ gm gt stocks pennystocks""

3. ""gt $ gm gt stocks pennystocks""

4. ""gt gm gt stocks pennystocks""

Each of these seems to be a URL or just stating stock symbols and such, so again, no content here.

So, since the relevant tweet that mentions pennystocks is ""gt gm gt stocks pennystocks"", I can see it's discussing the performance of pennystocks. But without context from other tweets, like previous ones, this tweet alone might not be sufficient to determine the stock's sentiment.

I think maybe there's a missing tweet or some other data that should have been included for context, but given what's provided, I'm limited in analysis here. Since no other factors are mentioned besides pennystocks, it's hard to assess their impact on the overall stock price.

Therefore, without sufficient information about how this tweet affects the company and its stock, my analysis can't be thorough enough. I might have missed some context or additional data that would influence the sentiment score."
2015-11-29,Negative,"Okay, I need to figure out how the given tweets affect the stock price of BABA (Baba) for this company. Let's go through each tweet step by step.

First, identifying the target stock is easy—it's clearly BABA. So we're focusing on their performance.

Looking at the first tweet: ""AT_USER alternatively , nyse like $ baba did ."". It seems like it's talking about some news related to BABA but doesn't provide much specific information or positive or negative points yet.

Second tweet: ""now working on new trades in these symbols this week . $ msft $ aapl $ baba $ amzn and $ fb URL URL"". This is also just mentioning that the user is involved in trading these stocks. It doesn't mention any positive or negative trends, so I can't tell much from here.

Third tweet: ""hmeisler sspencer_smb they much better at calling bottoms ( $ baba , $ fb ) than tops . URL"". This seems to suggest that BABA is performing better when the user is talking about bottoms rather than tops. The phrase ""calling bottoms"" could imply that the stock is doing well in certain scenarios, which might be seen as positive.

Fourth tweet: ""rt AT_USER weekend review video ( 11/29 ): $ spy $ iwm $ qqq $ fxi $ baba $ bidu $ aapl $ amzn $ cmg $ fb $ googl $ nflx $ pcln $ nke $ ua $ di … URL"". It's talking about a review video on a weekend. The mention of various stocks, including BABA (baba), is positive but it doesn't provide specific information or sentiment indicators.

Fifth tweet: ""rt AT_USER aa alcoa , inc . stock message board URL $ aa $ efa $ xly $ baba aa stockmarket stockmarket"". Similar to the previous ones, this seems like a user reviewing their own stock. It's not giving any indication of positive or negative trends.

Sixth tweet: ""top trade patterns in stock ... cheer . $ study $ aapl $ baba $ xom $ cvx $ amzn $ goog $ msft $ ibm $ mon stockmarket URL"". Again, this is about reviewing stocks and mentioning that people are encouraging them. It doesn't specify if it's positive or negative.

Putting all these together: The user seems to be involved in trading various stocks, some of which are BABA. There's no clear indication of improvement or decline in specific metrics for BABA. Some tweets mention how certain stocks perform better when the topic is about bottoms, but this isn't a consistent pattern throughout the provided tweets.

Therefore, while there might be occasional positive statements towards BABA from other stocks, without any explicit information suggesting an upward trend or negative indicators, it's hard to assign a clear overall sentiment. It seems like the focus is more on general trading experiences and stock performance of related companies rather than specific to BABA."
2015-11-30,Missing,File not found
2015-12-01,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to figure out their impact on the stock price of BABA. Let me start by looking at each tweet one by one.

The first tweet is about a technical analysis video for $Baba on December 12, 2015. That seems like a data point or event, but it's from a few years back. I don't think recent news affects the stock price much unless there are significant events around that time. It might influence investor sentiment, but probably not enough to change the overall outlook.

The second tweet mentions $Baba holding in Alibaba Group and their services stocks news review on December 1, 2015. Again, this is from a couple of years ago. While it's about their performance, unless there's something notable around that time, I don't think this affects the current stock price.

The third tweet talks about $Baba's stock price being updated on Tuesday, December 1, 2015 at 2:07 PM with a price of $X. It mentions some URLs and trading hours, but it doesn't provide any new information beyond confirming the status of BABA. This is just additional information without any positive or negative cues.

The fourth tweet is directed by RT to AT_USER, listing several keywords like $Baba, $JD, $NTE, etc., with mentions of China internet and suggestions for buying/selling gold stocks. It's a business advice tweet suggesting actions based on gold prices, but it doesn't provide any financial information about BABA's stock price.

Putting this all together, none of the tweets give me any significant positive or negative clues about BABA's performance. They're mostly reporting events from a few years back or just confirming something without sentiment impact."
2015-12-02,Positive,"Okay, I need to determine the likely impact on the stock price of a given company based on the provided tweets. Let me start by understanding the process step by step.

First, the user mentioned that each tweet is analyzed for positive or negative factors. Then, sentiment is evaluated, and overall sentiment is combined. The target stock symbol isn't specified in the tweets, but from the content, it seems like it's ""BABA"" because some tweets mention it, others talk about YHOO (which is also known as BABA). 

Looking at the tweets:

1. The first tweet says ""$ leaving with $ baba ? URL"". That doesn't seem informative or relevant to the stock price.
2. The second tweet talks about AT_USER and mentions a spinoff of YHOO. It's speculative but states that both are up early, suggesting potential for growth.
3. Third tweet discusses stocks news involving SUNEDISON (SUNE), Columbia Pipeline (COPX), etc., which might be unrelated or unrelated to BABA.
4. The fourth tweet mentions a sale related to another company and refers to the MAYER SHOW. Doesn't directly relate to BABA.
5. Fifth tweet suggests expecting the core of $YHOO to go PECET, relates to expenses and cash flow for $BABA, which could indicate good financial news affecting prices.
6. Sixth tweet discusses options on BABA, specifically a 4/15 $95 call with some movement data.
7. Seventh tweet mentions various stocks including BABA.

From this, it seems the tweets are more about BABA's performance in terms of core earnings or financial news. The mention of expected PECET (which likely stands for Positive Expected Cash Flow) and a positive cash flow from $YHOO could indicate good news that might boost stock prices.

The analysis should categorize each tweet as positive, negative, or neutral. Since the tweets are mostly about BABA's performance without specific information on others, it leans towards speculative positive sentiment because they mention increases in financial metrics and potential for growth."
2015-12-03,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of baba. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, identifying the target stock is straightforward—baba is clear from the last few tweets. Each tweet talks about different aspects related to baba's performance, trends, or future outlook. My task is to assess how these factors collectively influence investor sentiment and affect the stock price.

Starting with tweet 1: It mentions baba reaching a high on the day and points to $sgyp and $vtcq as futures prices. The word ""high"" suggests that baba might be in the upward trend, which could indicate positive sentiment. However, it's speculative about future movements.

Tweet 2 talks about igm stock being involved in an ETF fund with a market cap of $pbr. This mentions a market capitalization but doesn't directly relate to baba. So, not too informative for baba's performance.

Tweet 3 is a list of prices for several stocks, including $yohoo and $baba. While it mentions ""us top 5 most active,"" there's no mention of trends or future outcomes related to baba. It could be speculative but not directly affecting baba.

Tweet 4 suggests that alibaba (which is likely to refer to baba) might buy Yahoo stock during the premarket, priced at $yhoo. If alibaba is a competitor, this could indicate potential competition or investment from a rival, which might affect baba's share price negatively.

Tweet 5 mentions stock tickers trending in the last hour on TwTR, including $baba and others like $ms, $nok, etc. This shows that baba is being discussed by other investors but doesn't specify any direction or significance for its stock performance.

Tweet 6 simply restates $baba without providing additional context. It's a straightforward statement that doesn't offer insights into the market reaction.

Tweet 7 mentions expecting $85 before the new year, which seems like a future target price. This could signal a positive outlook for baba, but it's speculative and not backed by specific information from other tweets.

Tweet 8 discusses various ETFs with symbols including $baba. Similar to tweet 2, this is about other stocks and doesn't provide any direct insights into baba's performance.

Tweet 9 mentions stock prices for rsp and pcar ETFs, which are different from baba. Again, no info on baba here.

Looking at the overall analysis: Each tweet provides some context about baba but varies in specificity and direction. The tweets do touch upon future targets (tweet 7), potential competition or investment (tweet 4), but they don't provide enough direct evidence of positive, neutral, or negative factors affecting baba's stock price. The speculative nature of these statements makes it difficult to confidently assess a single sentiment without more concrete information.

I have to make a conclusion based on the available data. There's no clear trend in terms of positive, negative, or neutral behavior towards baba. Each tweet either provides context about competitors or future targets but lacks specific data that would tip the scales one way or another."
2015-12-04,Negative,"Alright, so I need to determine whether these tweets are likely to positively, neutrally, or negatively impact the stock price of $BABA (formerly known as BABA). Let me break this down step by step.

First, each tweet is analyzed individually. The first one mentions that $tsts has gained 336% in the past two weeks and highlights some stock symbols like $baba, $seji, and $swet. These are all related to financial news about BABA or other stocks. 

The second tweet from Alibaba talks about a taxi war heating up with $baba. That's interesting because it connects a social issue (taxi rides) with the stock of BABA, which could potentially impact investor sentiment positively if there's a positive correlation.

The third tweet mentions that $baba has gained 2% from yesterday and notes some factors like risk management and director hedge anomalies. This seems to be presenting clear upward momentum based on recent performance.

Lastly, the fourth tweet asks investors for the value of $YHOO without mentioning $BABA or $TA BLX. It uses ""without"" which might imply that it's a way to encourage investment in other stocks, but since it doesn't directly mention BABA, it's less likely to significantly impact its stock price.

Now, summarizing each tweet:
1. Positive news about the company.
2. Socially relevant news connecting a company with a social issue.
3. Direct and clear positive performance data.
4. Encouraging investment in unrelated companies without mentioning BABA.

Considering all this, the overall sentiment seems to be positive because the tweets are highlighting either direct financial health of BABA or socially relevant information that could positively influence investor confidence. The social aspect might make some investors feel optimistic about BABA's future despite other factors mentioned."
2015-12-05,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of IBM. The user provided two tweets, but it looks like only one is actually in the format I was given. Let me check again.

Wait, no, both of them are similar: they mention ibm international business machines and talk about investing with $ amounts. But wait, the first tweet says ""ibm eod data URL $ ibm $ hvu.to $ fro $ baba ibm stock investing."" The second one is a bit cut off but includes similar content.

So I need to analyze each tweet step by step.

First, identifying the target stock. Looking at both tweets, they mention ibm, so that's our target. Now, for each tweet, I should separate the factors—Positive and Negative—and assess the sentiment.

Starting with the first tweet: ""ibm eod data URL $ ibm $ hvu.to $ fro $ baba ibm stock investing."" This seems like a request or an inquiry about investing in IBM. It's open-ended, which might suggest uncertainty about the stock's performance.

Then, the second tweet is similar: ""ibm international business machines eod data URL $ ibm $ fro $ baba ibm stock investing."" Again, it's asking for investment advice with those $ signs and mentions both IBM and a different company.

Now, I need to assess each tweet. The first one starts with ""eod data URL,"" which suggests the user is checking real-time data about IBM (probably iShares global equity funds). The quotes indicate that they're investing in IBM stock, so it's an inquiry or potential investment decision.

In the second tweet, it mentions iShares as well, again talking about investing in IBM and another company. It doesn't provide specific information but is similar to the first.

I should consider each factor: Positive factors would be data (real-time), quotes from sources, and any mention of other companies. Negative factors might include potential risks or market trends, but since both tweets are open-ended and suggest investment decisions, I'm not sure if they're positive or negative.

Wait, maybe the positivity comes from the fact that both tweets are similar and the user is interested in investing in IBM, which would be a positive signal for stock price. The quotes and mentions of other companies might indicate diversification but don't necessarily add to the investment's potential.

So overall sentiment: Positive because it's about making an investment decision based on real data and source credibility."
2015-12-06,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets about gpro and their impact on stock price. Let me break it down.

First, looking at each tweet:

1. ""gpro groupon inc . financials URL $ gpro stocks pennystocks"" – Okay, the user is introducing a company named gpro, which sounds familiar. I know gpro is related to renewable energy and solar panels. The word ""renewable energy"" stands out as positive. But I should check more details.

2. It mentions ""pennystocks"". Pennystock is a financial institution that's focused on solar energy. This makes sense because gpro deals with solar panel manufacturing, so the connection here is strong for positive factors.

3. The sentence just ends, but there are no other tweets provided. So I only have two points: the introduction and the mention of pennystocks.

I don't see any negative words or terms that suggest concern. All mentions are positive about gpro's industry and financials. Even though it's a short list, the context gives a clear positive outlook on the stock."
2015-12-07,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on a stock's future price. The user provided a specific tweet, and I need to determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative.

First, looking at the tweet: ""intersting article about a new stock pick site . URL related : $ baba $ lnkd $ hlf URL."" Hmm, the text seems promotional. It mentions something about a new stock pick site linked to several stocks: BABA, LNK, and HLF. The structure here is pretty clean, no negative words or indicators of criticism.

Now, considering the process they outlined earlier: identifying the target stock symbol (BABA), then analyzing each tweet for positive or negative factors. But this particular tweet seems more about promoting the service than fact-checking a stock's performance. It doesn't mention any specific information about BABA or its stock price changes.

So, without specific data on BABA's current status, I can't assess whether this tweet is positive, neutral, or negative in terms of stock performance. Since it's more about marketing and promoting the service than evaluating a company's financial health, it likely doesn't provide any valuable information that would affect the stock price.

Therefore, based on the given instructions, since there are no specific factors related to BABA's performance being positive or negative, I should conclude that this tweet has no impact on the stock price. It might be part of a broader campaign but isn't directly influencing the market."
2015-12-08,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether these tweets are positive, negative, or neutral in terms of impact on a company's stock price. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at each tweet individually. The first one says, ""gain from movement in these buzzing assets $ baba $ googl $ nflx $ outr $ vrx URL URL."" Hmm, that seems like it's talking about gains from other stocks moving up. The words used here—like ""movement,"" ""buzzing,"" and the mention of different assets—are all positive indicators. Investors might be excited because things are moving in their favor. So this tweet suggests a positive outlook.

Now, the second tweet says, ""spxs direxion daily s & p 500 bear 3x shares shares URL $ spxs $ baba $ slv $ svxy spxs share nasdaq."" This one is a bit confusing. It mentions S&P 500 being in a bear trend and some other stocks like SLV and SVXY. While I know the S&P 500 can be volatile, ""bear"" indicates a potential downturn. But since it's part of a tweet, it might not convey as much investment sentiment directly. Maybe it's more about market conditions rather than investor reactions.

For the first tweet, the use of words like ""gain,"" ""movement,"" and ""buzzing"" makes me lean towards positive. Investors often react positively when others are moving up. On the other hand, the second tweet seems to focus on stock performance but doesn't specify if it's good or bad—just noting a bear trend. This is more about technical analysis than sentiment.

Considering both tweets together, the first one points to positive market movements, which can boost stock prices. The second, while talking about the S&P 500 being bearish, might not directly indicate investor sentiment but could be part of broader news. However, in the context of stock price impact, the stronger emphasis from the first tweet is more telling.

Therefore, putting it all together, I think the overall sentiment is positive because there's a clear indication that other assets are moving upward."
2015-12-09,Negative,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol. The user didn't specify it yet, but based on the first tweet mentions ""rwm,"" that's likely Russell Crowton Warrant. So we're focusing on rwm stock.

Now, I need to analyze each tweet as a tweet-by-tweet basis. Let me go through them one by one.

1. The first tweet says: ""rwm short russell 2000 fund eod data URL $ rwm $ wfc $ lmt $ baba rwm finance finance."" Hmm, it's talking about their stock and some other assets like WFC (Warriors Football Club), LMT, BABA (Barker & Associates), and RSFM (Russell short sell fund). It also mentions financial data URLs. So this is a mix of different financials and some active management funds. Since rwm is mentioned in multiple tweets, it's likely a position being held or tracked.

2. The second tweet: ""uvxy proshares ultra vix short-term futures etf current price URL $ uvxy $ hawk $ fb $ baba uvx … URL."" This looks like another set of financials from UVX (Union Valves & Expellers). The focus here is on their VIX short-term futures and the current price. Pro shares and the hawk ETF are also mentioned, which suggests they're tracking some index or ETF related to these companies.

3. Third tweet: ""rt AT_USER breaking : yahoo drops plans for alibaba spinoff amid activist pressure , tax questions $ yhoo $ baba URL."" This is about Yahoo dropping a spin-off of Alipay, probably due to activist influence and tax issues. It's looking at corporate mergers and acquisitions.

4. Fourth tweet: ""see why these assets are trending in 1 watchlist $ baba $ eurgbp $ lse $ lulu $ sensex URL."" This is about investing in a watchlist, so it's about diversifying into certain stocks or ETFs.

5. Fifth tweet: ""$ baba triangle 1min URL."" This seems like technical analysis, talking about the price movement and potential for a trend (triangle formation) over the next minute.

Now, compiling all these factors:

- rwm stock is involved in multiple tweets, indicating active tracking.
- uvxy and yhoo are financials from other companies.
- Yahoo's spin-off and tax issues imply corporate news affecting their operations.
- Investing in ETFs and short positions might mean portfolio management.
- Technical analysis suggesting potential price movements.

Overall sentiment-wise, the user is actively analyzing various assets and considering different strategies. They're tracking some stocks for position or coverage but also looking into others for broader trends. It's a mix of active research (tracking rwm) and speculative investment (investing in ETFs). However, without specific information on whether these actions are positive, negative, or neutral towards the company's stock price, it's hard to assign a single sentiment tag.

Considering all this, the overall impact seems mixed. There's both technical analysis suggesting changes and active management, but without concrete data on how these factors will affect rwm's performance, it's safer to conclude that there's no clear trend."
2015-12-10,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on a company's stock price and determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol in the tweets: gpro inc. So, I'm focusing on that specific stock. The first tweet is ""gpro gopro , inc . stock forum URL $ gpro $ etr $ baba $ sbux gpro invest share."" Hmm, that's a bit confusing with all those symbols and words. Maybe it's just some irrelevant information or placeholders.

Next, the user instructed me to analyze each tweet separately. So I'll need to go through each tweet one by one. But in this case, only one tweet is provided. Wait, maybe I misread that. Let me check again. It seems like there are multiple mentions of gpro inc. stock and other company names like etr, baba, sbux.

I should probably read the entire text carefully to extract relevant information. The user mentioned identifying the target stock symbol first, which is ""gpro inc."" in this tweet. Then, I need to separate positive and negative factors for each related tweet, but since there's only one tweet here, maybe it's just that single tweet.

Next, assess sentiment by evaluating how each tweet might influence investor sentiment. Since the text mentions gpro stock forum URL and other companies, perhaps it's more about information sharing or product launches. But without specific context on what these tweets are about—like any financial news or updates regarding gpro inc.—it's a bit challenging.

I need to consider whether there's any positive, negative, or neutral information being shared here that could impact the stock price. If the tweet is promoting gpro inc.'s products or services and suggests it will meet investor expectations, that could be positive. Conversely, if it's critical about certain details that are negative for investors, it might be negative.

Since I don't have specific details from this tweet, like any company news or financial statements, it's hard to determine the sentiment. Maybe it's neutral because there's no explicit information about positive or negative factors influencing gpro inc.'s stock price based on what's provided.

I should also consider whether other tweets in the set would provide more context if I had access to all of them, but since only one is here, my analysis might be limited. Without knowing more about what these tweets are discussing, it's hard to make an informed judgment. 

In conclusion, based solely on this tweet, there seems to be no explicit positive or negative information that affects gpro inc.'s stock price. Therefore, the overall sentiment remains neutral."
2015-12-11,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user wants me to analyze some tweets and determine if they have a positive, neutral, or negative impact on a stock's future price. They provided eight tweets and specified the output should be one of those three tags.

First, I need to extract the target stock from each tweet. Looking at each one:

1. ""do you agree bnp analyst's view on $ baba ? URL see the call levels here URL URL"" – Not helpful, no stock symbol.
2. ""alibaba lands south china morning post URL premarket $ baba"" – Stock is BABA (Alibaba). 
3. ""$ baba is rated buy , 19.1 % upside by wall street analysts based on average ratings / targets URL URL"" – Stock is BABA, up 19%.
4. ""why alibaba bought the south china morning post $ baba URL"" – Doesn't mention a stock.
5. ""iyt ishares dj transportation average index fund yield URL $ iyt $ vnm $ trv $ baba iyt tradeideas finance"" – Not a stock.
6. ""rt AT_USER dow & dupont agree on deal , stupid name URL $ away $ baba $ bhi $ brk . a $ brk . b $ ccg $ cp $ dd $ expe $ hal $ h …"" – No stock mentioned.
7. ""xiu.to velocityshares daily inverse vix short term etn quotes URL $ xiu.to $ ewj $ tgldx $ baba xiu.to stocks stocks"" – Stock is BABA, down 50% as per the text.
8. ""$ baba scrapiron : the entire market got crushed today ! reason :: scrapiron URL"" – Not a stock.

So, only two tweets mention a stock symbol: BABA in tweets 2 and 7. Let's focus on those for impact analysis.

Now, each tweet's factors:

For BABA in tweet 2:
- Positive: The article mentions that analysts think BABA is up by 19%, suggesting positive sentiment.
- Negative: Not sure about any negative aspects mentioned here.

For BABA in tweet 7:
- Positive: It states a significant drop of 50%, which is a strong downward move, indicating some negative sentiment from the perspective of an investor.
- Also mentions that xiu.to stock is being bought, but not sure if it's positive or neutral towards the stock itself.

Putting it together, tweet 2 suggests BABA will go up, and tweet 7 indicates a significant drop. These can be conflicting signals. However, considering that in some markets, down moves are seen as bearish, especially on small-cap stocks like BABA which often have lower price levels compared to larger companies. But I need to consider the context of each tweet.

But wait, all other tweets don't mention a stock symbol except two. The user's output requires analyzing based on the given tweets and their impact on the stock. Since we're only focusing on BABA mentioned twice, which is up 19% in one and down 50% in another. It's unclear if this represents a consistent trend or just a short-term move.

However, looking at all other tweets, some are negative (like tweet 7 stating ""ixu.to velocityshares daily inverse vix short term etn quotes"" which could imply concerns about volatility). But again, without context, it's hard to assess.

Given that BABA is being discussed in two tweets with conflicting opinions, but each has a significant price movement. However, I need to make a conclusion based on the information available. The user wants a single line of positive, neutral, or negative impact. Since one tweet suggests an increase and another decrease, it's ambiguous without more context.

But considering that all other tweets are negative in nature (e.g., the ones mentioning volatility and concerns), perhaps BABA being down 50% is a strong enough indicator to lean negatively. Alternatively, if there were multiple negative opinions about BABA, but here only two tweets, one up, one down.

I think I need to pick based on the factors each tweet brings in. The positive tweet suggests a possible up move, while the negative tweet indicates a potential drop. But without more context or additional data points, it's challenging to determine the overall impact. Therefore, perhaps the overall sentiment is Neutral because there are conflicting signals.

Wait, but looking back at the user's output requirements: they just need one line with [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Since both tweets mention BABA, and each has a significant movement in price, it's unclear whether to classify as positive or negative. Maybe neutral since we don't have consistent data on BABA.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that BABA is mentioned only twice and the other tweets are mostly negative, but given the specific context of the user asking about impact based solely on these tweets, I think it's better to conclude Neutral because both positive and negative opinions are present."
2015-12-12,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative in terms of their impact on the stock price of a company. The user has provided three tweets, each with some factors and mentions. Let me break this down step by step.

First, for each tweet, I need to identify the target stock symbol. Looking at the first tweet: ""intersting article about a new stock pick site . URL related : $ baba $ lnkd $ fb $ hlf URL"". The word 'baba' appears in it, so I think that's the target stock.

The second tweet is: ""erx direxion daily energy bull 3x shares p / e ratio URL $ erx $ qld $ baba $ gs erx nasdaq tradeideas"". This one mentions 'erx', 'direxion', 'daily energy', 'bull', and '3x shares p/E'. I don't recognize this as a major stock symbol, but maybe it's a typo or something else. Not sure yet.

The third tweet is: ""track trending assets in 1 watchlist $ baba $ fb $ ing $ phm $ vac URL URL"". Again, 'baba' seems to be the stock mentioned here.

So now I have two tweets with 'baba', and one with 'erx'. Let's focus on the ones with 'baba'.

First tweet: ""intersting article about a new stock pick site . URL related : $ baba $ lnkd $ fb $ hlf URL"". The mention of a new stock pick site seems like positive, but I don't have any specific information about this stock. However, the URL mentions other companies as well, which might indicate that they're researching various assets, including 'fb' (Facebook), 'hlf' (HiFi Audio), and maybe others.

Second tweet: ""track trending assets in 1 watchlist $ baba $ fb $ ing $ phm $ vac URL URL"". This one is more about tracking assets. The words 'trending assets', 'tracking assets', 'fb' again, 'ing', which might be an abbreviation for something like 'institutions' or 'iPod'? Wait, 'ing' isn't a word on my keyboard. Maybe it's a typo? Or perhaps 'ing' refers to a sector? I'm not sure.

Third tweet: ""track trending assets in 1 watchlist $ baba $ fb $ ing $ phm $ vac URL URL"". It seems similar to the second one, maybe with 'phm'? Not sure. Again, no specific info on 'erx'.

Now, let's analyze each positive tweet:

1. The first tweet mentions a new stock pick site and other companies, which might suggest diversification or thorough research into various assets, including Facebook (FB), which is a tech company. This could imply that the investors are looking at multiple sectors, which might be seen as cautious but not necessarily negative.

2. The second tweet talks about tracking trending assets in a watchlist, which indicates active monitoring and possibly an investment strategy focused on current trends. This is more of a positive signal for someone actively managing their portfolio.

3. The third tweet again mentions tracking trending assets but with a different set of companies: 'ing' and 'phm'. If 'ing' isn't a recognized abbreviation or industry, it might be another company in the same context as FB. Still, without specific info on ERX, I can't make much of this.

Since all positive tweets mention FB (as 'fb' appears multiple times) and indicate strategies related to asset tracking, which could imply that these are being managed by a certain group or sector. However, without knowing more about ERX's specific impact, it's hard to say if they're good or bad.

Considering the overall sentiment, the tweets suggest positive actions like diversification, asset tracking, and active management. These might not inherently be negative but could influence investors positively. It's possible that this isn't a significant downturn affecting the stock price."
2015-12-13,Positive,"Alright, I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the company. Let's start by identifying the target stock symbol. The tweets mention ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . news URL $ baba $ oks $ payx $ googl baba pennystocks stock,"" which seems like it might be referring to BABA, but I'm not entirely sure. Sometimes these abbreviations can be confusing.

Next, I'll separate each tweet into Positive and Negative factors. For the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER baba alibaba group holding ltd . news URL $ baba $ oks $ payx $ googl baba pennystocks stock."" It looks like it's talking about BABA holding a company that offers various products (since they mention products like baba, oks, payx, google), which might indicate growth or innovation. The user is probably updating the stock price via Twitter.

Now, considering Sentiment: The tweet seems to be promoting BABA as a strong performer because it's mentioning specific products. Investors usually see positive signs that can boost sentiment towards a company.

Looking at the second tweet: ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . news URL $ baba $ oks $ payx $ googl baba pennystocks stock."" This seems redundant with the first one, possibly a duplicate or another update about the same stock. It's likely reinforcing positive information without new context.

Putting it all together, both tweets are promoting BABA and its expanding product portfolio. This is a classic positive signal for investors looking to buy stocks. Therefore, the overall sentiment should be Positive."
2015-12-14,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a given company. 

First, I need to identify the target stock. Looking at the tweets, none of them mention a specific stock symbol, so maybe it's better to think in terms of the sentiment rather than an exact company.

Now, each tweet is analyzed individually. The first tweet says ""jones 2000 : stock info : alibaba ( $ baba ) agreed to buy hong kong ’ s south URL."" This seems like a news item about Alibaba buying a part of Hong Kong's URL, which could indicate positive sentiment towards the company.

The second tweet is ""aa alcoa , inc . e . p . s . URL $ aa $ xlu $ baba $ abx aa stockmarket stocks."" It looks like it's discussing the stock of Alcoa or another company with symbols. The mention of ""stockmarket stocks"" might suggest a positive outlook, but I'm not entirely sure.

The third tweet is ""rt AT_USER . AT_USER 2 $ baba "" the real value of AT_USER is not in the price tag , but in freedom "" last column imd_prc URL."" This seems like it's discussing an AI developer or developer stock. The quote about real value and freedom could be positive, indicating a company that values innovation.

So combining these thoughts, each tweet has some positive aspects: Alibaba buying something, a positive stock market outlook, and attention to free radical theory, which is often seen as innovative. Therefore, the overall sentiment is positive."
2015-12-15,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll look for the target stock symbol in each tweet. Hmm, looking at the first tweet: ""wall street breakfast : stocks rise despite investor anxiety URL $ spy $ qqq $ ba $ baba $ cmcsa $ d … URL"". It mentions spy and qqq as possible targets, so I think those are the stocks we're focusing on.

Next, for each tweet, I need to identify positive and negative factors. The first tweet has several stock names: spy, qqq, ba, etc. Let me check if these represent major sectors or companies that might be in the news.

""Wall Street breakfast"" could imply stock performance related to tech or financials. ""Investor anxiety"" is a common sentiment, especially for stocks during economic downturns. So maybe positive factors here are some sector-specific news about their performance.

Then there's something with ""CMCSA"" and others. CMCSA is often associated with consumer services companies. If they're talking about their earnings or stock price changes, that could be a positive factor if the company is doing well.

The last tweet has two words: ""d $"" which might refer to tech stocks like Microsoft (MSFT) or maybe some other sector-specific news. So another positive point here is another potential target.

Now, assessing each tweet's sentiment. The first one mentions investor anxiety about stocks rising despite that. It sounds like investors are worried about the market performance, so this could be a negative factor because of expected drop in confidence. But then it links to factors that might not be clear yet; maybe mixed feelings?

The second tweet just says ""Dollar"" which is often associated with U.S. economic data. If the dollar strengthens, it can impact stock prices negatively unless there's a corresponding improvement elsewhere.

Third tweet has CMCSA and other names. Again, CMCSA being consumer services could have positive or negative effects depending on how they perform during their specific periods.

The fourth tweet includes ""D $"", which might be a typo or specific to a company. If it's related to stock performance or earnings, that would add a positive factor.

Putting this together: The first tweet is mixed because investor anxiety makes the factors seem uncertain. The second tweet relates to economic data with a possible negative impact if the dollar moves. The third mentions sector-specific news which could be either good or bad depending on context. The fourth adds another stock, so it's positive for sentiment.

Overall, there are mixed signals. Some are positive, some are negative, and one is just listing potential targets. It seems like the factors might have a neutral effect because some are positive, others are uncertain, and one could be either. But without more context, I can't say definitively."

2015-12-20,Neutral,"Okay, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let's see, the user provided two tweet lines and an example output.

First, looking at the target stock symbol from the first tweet: eem. It seems like it's related to emerging markets, which is common for stocks like EEM or EMU. The second tweet mentions rig, share, pbr, iyt, etc., so maybe it's related to energy companies? I'm a bit confused because both words ""removing energy from the market"" and ""energy companies"" are present.

I think the key here is that eem refers to EEM or EMU stocks, which are part of the emerging markets. The other tweet talks about the removal of rig production, which is a sector-specific concern but might be linked to stock sentiment. 

Now, considering each tweet: the first one seems like a market update with several stock names and prices. This type of tweet usually doesn't affect investor sentiment much because it's more about trading action rather than providing information. The second tweet mentions removing rig production, which could indicate economic concerns or supply chain issues that might lead some investors to sell their stocks.

I'm leaning towards the overall sentiment being [Neutral] because while one tweet might have a slight effect, it doesn't provide substantial information that would significantly influence stock prices. It's more about an event that others are reacting to but not something that changes investor behavior enough to tip the balance."
2015-12-21,Neutral,"Okay, let me figure out how to determine the impact on the stock price based on these tweets. First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet.

Looking at the tweets:

1. The first tweet mentions several assets: $ btc, $ baba, etc., but it's in a general context about news for various assets. It doesn't specify the particular stock we're tracking.
2. The second tweet lists multiple stocks like $ aapl, $ amzn, $ baba, etc., so that might be the target stock. But I'm not sure which one yet; there are multiple names here.
3. The third tweet mentions alibaba's hiring, specifically the man in charge of fighting counterfeit goods with an impressive resume, and talks about $ baba URL. This seems relevant to baba, but again, it's broad.
4. The fourth tweet similarly mentions alibaba and matthew bassiur as head of intellectual property enforcement and links to $ baba URL. So another mention of baba.
5. The fifth tweet is about kmb, kimberly clark corp., posting on trade ideas with URLs like $ kmb, ilf, erx, etc., but also mentions $ baba.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. There are multiple possible target stocks here: alibaba, matthew bassiur, baba, kmb, ilf, erx, or baba again on another account. It's hard to pinpoint which one the user is referring to because each tweet mentions different stocks.

Since there are multiple mentions of baba and alibaba, I might have to assume that the target stock is either of these. However, given that it's a company's stock price, the context here seems vague. The other tweets like ilf or erx could be unrelated or part of different discussions.

Without clear information about which stock is being referred to in each tweet, it's challenging to assess the impact on its future price. Each tweet might be influencing investor sentiment for multiple stocks at once, making it hard to isolate a single stock's effect.

This uncertainty means I can't definitively categorize this as positive, neutral, or negative. It's possible that multiple stocks are affected based on these vague mentions, leading to an overall unpredictable trend."
2015-12-22,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the future stock price of a company based on the provided information.

First, looking at each tweet individually. The first tweet is about weekly analysts' ratings for Alibaba Group's holding on $BABA. While it provides some information, like the stock symbol and mentions analyst ratings, it doesn't give direct insights into the market sentiment or any specific predictions.

The second tweet discusses Wall Street breakfast data related to US economic data before holidays, mentioning several stocks: SPY, QQQ, AGL, AMX, BABA. It seems like this could influence investor behavior, especially with holiday events approaching. More financial data can affect trading volumes and stock prices as investors might adjust their expectations.

The third tweet talks about an up-to-date chart analysis for $AAPL, FB, TWTR, BABA, XOM, CVX, MON, AMZN, GOOG, MSFT, CLF, NQF, ESF, YMF. This is a broader view of the stock market performance and trends across multiple companies. It can show overall market conditions but might not directly impact individual stock performance without context.

The fourth tweet mentions $BABA showing an uptrend still viable. This is more about current performance rather than predicting future movements or sentiment changes. It's a bit vague but suggests ongoing gains, which could be positive but doesn't give clear indicators of long-term trends.

Now, combining all these factors. The third tweet provides market data that can affect investor confidence and overall market mood, which might influence stock price expectations. However, the first tweet is more about analyst ratings without sentiment. The fourth tweet suggests ongoing performance but isn't a predictive note. The second tweet introduces economic data, which can be positive or negative depending on the context of the holiday season.

Considering all these, the third tweet's chart analysis could indicate broader market trends that might influence investor decisions collectively. This could lead to positive sentiment if expected performance leads to increased demand for BABA stock. However, without concrete info on Wall Street data affecting specific stocks or analyst ratings, it's hard to pinpoint a clear trend.

I think the overall sentiment is neutral because while there are several factors influencing market dynamics, they're too varied and lack direct impact on individual stock prices. Investors might not have a clear direction from this information alone."
2015-12-23,Neutral,"Okay, I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company, specifically Apple Inc. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet mentions a debate about top internet investment topics for 2016 and targets specific stocks: AAPL, AMZN, BAA, FB, MSFT, YOOH, RAX, PYPL, SQ, URL. It doesn't directly mention Apple, so maybe not related.

2. The second tweet talks about huge gains on penny stocks starting next year, mentioning URLs,Segi, BBAB, SWET. Again, no direct info on Apple or its stock.

3. Third tweet lists trending stocks like TSLA, GE, EWHJ, MSFT, QQQ, T, INTC, FB, BABA, KO. Again, no mention of Apple.

4. Fourth tweet includes a list of ETFs related to Apple: EEM, EWHJ, MSFT, VWWO, CSCO, BABA, KO, VZ, CVX, AMJ, ABBV, IOGE, OKE, AIG, XLP, COG. This is very relevant because Apple has many of these ETFs. The user mentions ""iemg"" but that's a typo for ""IOGE."" So there are direct mentions of Apple stocks.

5. Fifth tweet points out BABA top news on Dec 23, 2015, which is about trading history, not stock performance.

6. Sixth tweet says the user commented on stocktwits, expressing frustration and saying they can't predict BABA's future performance because others are pushing it around. It seems like negative sentiment from other investors.

7. Seventh tweet discusses BABA holding a company called E.P.S., which is part of Alibaba Group Limited. It mentions the stockmarket but doesn't mention Apple directly or relate to its current performance.

Putting this together, the main positive point is the fourth tweet where Apple ETFs are listed, indicating investor interest in their stocks. However, the sixth tweet shows negative sentiment from others about predicting BABA's future. Since there are both positive and negative signals, it's a mix that leans towards [Neutral] because while there are signs of interest through ETFs, the community is divided on BABA itself."
2015-12-24,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how the given tweets affect the stock price of a company. The user provided two tweets and specified that I should analyze them as if they were relevant to a specific stock. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet: ""baba alibaba group holding ltd . company info URL $ baba $ lmt $ amba $ gasl baba investing pennystocks"". Hmm, that seems a bit confusing with all those symbols. Maybe it's a specific stock name? I'll assume it's BABA or another stock symbol for now.

Next, the second tweet: ""invest stocks yahoo to alert users of suspected state-sponsored hacking attacks : yahoo ... URL $ fb $ aapl $ baba $ ibm"". That also includes some other companies mentioned like FB and IBM. Maybe these are related to the target stock? Or perhaps the user is promoting investing in certain companies as a precaution against hacking?

Now, I need to break down each tweet into factors: Positive and Negative. For each tweet, assess its sentiment towards the target stock.

Looking at the first tweet: It mentions ""invest stocks pennystocks"", which might be a form of marketing or promotion. So that's a positive factor. The company name includes ""baba alibaba group holding ltd."", which could indicate they're active in the tech or finance sector, but without more info, it's hard to say if it's positive or negative.

For the second tweet: It mentions investing stocks to alert users about hacking attacks. Again, promoting something proactive by suggesting investors take action. That's another positive factor.

Putting them together, both tweets are promoting investments as a form of safety during potential threats. So that suggests a positive impact on stock price.

Wait, but I need to make sure each tweet isn't just talking about itself or other stocks without context. The first tweet is about ""invest pennystocks"", which could be related to BABA if pennystocks refers to a company with the same symbol. The second tweet is promoting investing in other companies like FB and IBM, which are unrelated to the target stock unless it's implied.

But since both tweets mention promoting investments as a precaution against hacking attacks, that reinforces a positive sentiment towards the overall approach, even if not directly tied to one specific company.

So combining these, each tweet contributes positively by suggesting proactive investing, thus likely boosting the stock price."
2015-12-25,Negative,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to determine whether the given tweets are likely to impact the stock price of a company. Let me break down each step based on what I know.

First, looking at the target stock symbol from the first tweet: ""apple pay scales the great wall URL $ ssnlf $ baba $ aapl URL."" Hmm, ""baba"" sounds familiar; that's a popular stock symbol. So I think the company in question is BABA or BBTC. The symbol includes ""baba,"" which usually refers to Binance Smart Chain, but given the context with Apple and scaling services, maybe it's Binance, specifically BNB. But wait, Binance is already known for its tokenization, so perhaps it's a different stock.

Next, looking at each tweet:

1. The first tweet mentions ""apple pay scales the great wall URL"" and then lists $ ssnlf, $ baba, and $ aapl. Since I'm assuming the target stock is BABA or BBTC, this tweet seems to be about the performance of Binance's BNB token. Apple Pay is known for integrating payment services across multiple platforms. Scaling in the context of the great wall might refer to expanding their services.

2. The second tweet talks about ""see why these assets are trending in 1 watchlist"" and lists several crypto tokens: $ eog, $ fb, $ twtr, $ baba, etc. This looks like a list of crypto assets that are being discussed on a watchlist. Cryptocurrencies are generally volatile, so this could be indicating that investors are watching these assets for their potential future performance.

3. The third tweet mentions ""invests usd 1.25 b in food delivery service platform ele.me URL by AT_USER URL."" This seems more about investment decisions and specific to an individual user or company, perhaps AT&T? But the symbol includes ""usd,"" which might be a currency exchange rate factor.

4. The fourth tweet says ""rt AT_USER baba alibaba group holding ltd . short sales"" and lists $ amgn, $ dd, etc., with mentions of Binance. This seems to be talking about selling Binance tokens (short sales) for investment purposes.

Now, I need to analyze each tweet's factors:

1. Positive factors: The tweet is discussing the performance of a crypto asset, which can have mixed effects. However, the mention of Apple Pay and potential expansion in the U.S. market might indicate positive signals, but it's also speculative.

2. Negative factors: The use of ""watchlist"" suggests that the tweet is about potential investments or trends, not necessarily negative. It's more about discussing assets that are being monitored by investors.

3. Positive factors: Investing a specific currency (USD) could be seen as a positive move for foreign exchange or speculative trading.

4. Negative factors: Short sales indicate selling positions, which can affect the price if there's confidence in their value, possibly leading to negative sentiment if these transactions impact investor behavior.

Now, combining all factors:

- The tweet is about discussing crypto assets and potential investments.
- Apple Pay expansion could be a positive sign for a company's performance.
- Speculative investing (short sales) might lead to volatility but could also indicate confidence in the asset's future value.

Considering the overall sentiment, while there are both speculative elements and investment discussions, these can create uncertainty. The use of ""watchlist"" suggests investor interest but doesn't clearly show a trend or expected outcome. Combined with potential positive signs from Apple Pay, it leans towards a mixed view, which might be considered [Neutral]."
2015-12-26,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to figure out if they'll impact the stock price positively, neutrally, or negatively for a company. Let me start by identifying the stock symbol from the first tweet: ""vym vanguard high dividend yield bid size URL $ vym $ ewj $ baba $ sune vym finance pennystocks"". Looking at this, I see mentions of VBM, EWM, BABA (which is BSW), SUNE, and FINAN. The symbol seems to be ""VBM"" or possibly ""BSW"" because VBM isn't a standard symbol but BSW is. Since the user didn't specify which one it is, I'll have to make an assumption here.

Next, looking at each tweet:

1. **Tweet 1**: ""vym vanguard high dividend yield bid size URL $ vym $ ewj $ baba $ sune vym finance pennystocks"". This seems like a list of stocks or symbols. It doesn't mention any positive or negative factors related to the stock, so I might consider it neutral.

2. **Tweet 2**: ""some of the charts i had posted last week , still look okay . this includes $ akba $ lxft and even $ baba for the matter of fact ."" This tweet is talking about past posts from a user who was reviewing charts. It doesn't provide any information about stock performance or sentiment towards specific stocks, so I don't think it affects the overall stock price.

3. **Tweet 3**: ""$ baba : stocks with active momentum - cisco systems , inc . ( nasdaq : csco … : URL"". Again, this tweet is discussing a stock mentioned in a quote and mentions other companies on their website. It's not indicating positive or negative sentiment towards the stock.

Since none of these tweets provide specific information about the target stock or any positive or negative analysis, I'm leaning toward them having no significant impact on the stock price. However, given that some tweets discuss past performance (Tweet 2) and others are about active momentum (Tweet 3), it might hint at a potential upward trend but not enough to make a definitive conclusion."
2015-12-27,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze the given tweets and determine their likely impact on the future stock price of a company. The user provided a list of tweets from different stocks, but in this case, I'm focusing on a single tweet that's part of a dataset.

First, looking at the tweet: ""jumps in nyse shorts : $ bbd $ pfe $ aa $ baba $ ncr $ teva $ jwn $ fcx $ gps $ hd $ cnx $ sfun $ lyg $ p $ lvs $ sune $ fit $ x $ cop URL""

Hmm, I notice that the tweet mentions ""jumps in nyse shorts"" and several company names like bbd, pfe, aa, etc. It also includes some dollar amounts and stock codes. The structure seems like multiple stocks are being mentioned with different symbols or identifiers.

The user's query is to determine how this affects the stock price of a given company. But wait, in the provided tweets list, I don't see any specific stock mentioned; it's just a collection of various companies and their symbols.

I think there might be some confusion here. If each tweet represents different stocks, then evaluating their impact individually isn't possible without more context about which stock we're focusing on. The output format is expecting a single conclusion about [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative] based on the given tweets.

Since I don't have specific information about a particular company, I can only analyze the provided tweet as it stands. However, this tweet doesn't provide any directional information like positive or negative trends; instead, it's listing several stocks with various symbols and mentions a few jumps.

Given that, maybe the user intended to include more context or identify a specific stock. But based on what's given, I can only assess if each tweet is positive, negative, or neutral towards the stock being discussed. Since there's no actual data or trend in the provided tweets, it's hard to make an accurate conclusion.

Perhaps the user wants me to provide instructions for someone who includes a specific stock in their analysis? Or maybe they're testing my ability to handle multiple stocks without more information. In that case, I might need to explain how to process each tweet and determine sentiment relative to a particular stock.

But since the current problem is just about this single tweet, and it's not enough for me to evaluate its impact on any specific stock, I think the best approach is to state that without additional context or data points related to the target stock, I can't provide an accurate overall sentiment.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants a summary of all the factors mentioned in the tweet. Let me see: positive factors include ""jumps"" and mentions several stocks. Negative factors might be less obvious because the tweet doesn't specify any negative elements beyond that.

In conclusion, without knowing which stock we're assessing or additional information about its performance, I can't determine if this tweet is positive, neutral, or negative for it."
2015-12-28,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the future stock price of a company. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I see two tweets. The first one is ""rt AT_USER $ baba URL."" Hmm, that looks like a link tag but in lowercase. Maybe it's just a typo or placeholder. I'll assume it's not meaningful and ignore it for the stock analysis part.

The second tweet says: ""googl horizons alphapro seasonal rotation etf quotes URL $ googl $ aa $ baba $ arg googl stock … URL."" Let me parse this. It looks like it's a combination of some stock ticker symbols: 'googl', 'alpha pro', etc., and mentions other words like 'seasonal rotation' and 'etf quotes.' 

So, the main companies here are Google (GOOGL), Alpha Pro (ALPPO), and perhaps others related to 'baba,' 'arg', and 'aa.' These are all tech stocks. But without specific information about what these stocks do or their current performance, it's hard to assess the stock price directly.

I don't see any positive statements like ""increasing,"" ""good news,"" or mentions of upcoming projects. Similarly, there aren't any negative sentiments such as ""bad news"" or concerns. The tweets are more about general trends and company names rather than specific events affecting the stock price.

Since the user provided an example response saying ""[Neutral]"" for these tweets, maybe it's because they don't have specific information pointing to positive or negative sentiment. Without knowing if these stocks are improving, stable, or declining, I can't assign a strong positive or negative impact.

So, considering all this, my conclusion is that the stock market isn't significantly influenced by the given tweets."
2015-12-29,Missing,File not found
2015-12-30,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, I have these tweets and I need to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided a query where they've given some tweets about two companies, AAPL and GILD, and asked for an overall sentiment analysis.

First, I'll break down what's required. From the instructions, I understand that I have to extract the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at the tweets, it seems like both AAPL (which is Apple Inc., the stock symbol) and GILD (Gillette Corporation, which is $gild). But the user didn't specify a particular company; maybe that's part of the problem.

Wait, no, looking again, I see two separate tweets: one about AAPL and another about GILT. Hmm, perhaps the first tweet is about AAPL? Or is it possible that both are from the same source?

But moving on to the processing steps provided. The user wants me to analyze each tweet by tweet for factors and sentiment. Let's take them one by one.

First tweet: ""cnbcclosingbell saraeisen lets here your picks for 2016 . here are my top 5 picks $ aapl $ baba $ fb $ gild and $ googl … URL""

Hmm, this seems to be a list of investments. The user is encouraging people to pick among Apple (AAPL), BABA (Balerauwe Biotech Holding), FB (脸书), GOOG (Google). It's all about investing in the stock market.

I need to extract the target stock symbol from here. But looking at this tweet, it doesn't mention either AAPL or GILT directly. Maybe the user is focusing on a different company? Or perhaps there's confusion because both tweets are related but about different stocks.

Wait, actually, the second tweet seems more relevant: ""GILTT is up 3% ... just saw $500 billion in revenue. Did any of this get mentioned in the first tweet?""

So maybe the user wants me to analyze both GILT and AAPL from two separate tweets. But that doesn't make sense because each tweet refers to a different company.

Wait, now I'm confused. The user's initial prompt is about analyzing tweets for stock price impact. It seems like they provided two tweets: one about AAPL and another about GILT.

But in the output, they want me to conclude with ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"". So perhaps each tweet is independent, but since both are about different stocks, maybe it's not intended for that.

Alternatively, maybe I need to process each tweet separately. Let's see:

First tweet: This seems like a call to action towards investing in various tech companies, Apple, BABA, FB, and Google. It might be promoting the idea of stock trading but not directly mentioning any stock symbol.

Second tweet: GILTT is up 3%, did any mention of revenue? Revenue increased by $500 billion. So this tweet could be indicating that investing in Gillette's stock would result in a positive outcome due to higher revenue growth.

But wait, the user didn't specify which stock to analyze here. This complicates things because I don't know which stock is being referred to in each tweet.

Alternatively, perhaps both tweets are about different companies and each needs analysis separately. But since the output requires a single conclusion, maybe it's expecting an overall analysis from all relevant tweets.

But in that case, how do I decide whether to consider both or just one? The user might have provided two tweets but wants an impact on the stock price of a particular company. Since they didn't specify which company, this is ambiguous.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe each tweet pertains to a different stock, and for the purpose of this analysis, both need to be considered together in terms of their overall impact on the market or specifically on one stock.

But given that the output requires only one conclusion, maybe the user intended for me to look at one specific company's tweets. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the same company being mentioned in multiple tweets.

Alternatively, I might have misread the initial tweets. Let me check again:

1. ""cnbcclosingbell saraeisen lets here your picks for 2016 . here are my top 5 picks $ aapl $ baba $ fb $ gild and $ googl … URL""

This seems to list several stocks, but I don't see any target stock symbol in this tweet.

2. ""GILTT is up 3% ... just saw $500 billion in revenue. Did any of this get mentioned in the first tweet?""

So the second tweet mentions GILTT and mentions a revenue increase, which might be related to Gillette's performance, potentially influencing their stock price.

But again, I'm confused because the user didn't specify which company's tweet is being analyzed for stock impact.

Wait, perhaps the user wants an analysis of both companies from these tweets. So each tweet can provide factors and sentiment towards either AAPL or GILTT.

Given that, maybe the overall impact on the market would consider both stocks. But since the output requires a single conclusion, I might have to combine their effects somehow.

Alternatively, perhaps only one company is relevant, but given that the user provided two tweets without context, it's unclear.

Wait, another thought: The first tweet seems more promotional in nature, maybe promoting AAPL as a stock trading platform. But actually, AAPL is an investment firm, not a stock. Maybe this is a marketing note rather than a direct market analysis.

So perhaps the user wants to know whether there's any positive or negative impact from these tweets towards the overall company performance, but without knowing which specific stock symbol is being referred to in each tweet, it's difficult.

Given that, maybe I should focus on the GILTT tweet since it clearly mentions a revenue increase and mentions it as a potential stock performance indicator. But again, without context about AAPL or GILT's stock symbols, it's unclear.

Wait, perhaps the user intended for me to analyze each tweet separately, considering their impact on their target stocks. So from ""cnbcclosingbell saraeisen lets here your picks for 2016 . here are my top 5 picks $ aapl $ baba $ fb $ gild and $ googl … URL"", perhaps the user is referring to AAPL, as it's an investment firm.

But without knowing which company each tweet is about, it's challenging. Maybe I should consider that both tweets are from different companies and analyze them separately. However, since the output needs a single conclusion, I might have to pick one based on some reasoning.

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants me to focus only on the GILTT tweet because it directly mentions revenue growth, which could be positive for Gillette's stock. But again, without knowing if that relates to their stock price impact, it's speculative.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The initial processing steps mention that the output is based on target stock symbols and analyzing each tweet. So perhaps both tweets are about different companies, but in reality, they could be about the same company or different ones.

Given that, perhaps it's better to process each tweet separately as if targeting specific stocks. But since I don't have a clear target stock symbol from either tweet, maybe I'm supposed to analyze based on what's mentioned in each tweet.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the tweets is about AAPL and another about GILT. So, let me consider that:

First tweet: Promotional note towards investing, mentioning several tech stocks but no specific stock symbol.

Second tweet: GILTT ( Gillette Corporation) with a 3% increase in revenue from $40 billion to $500 billion and mentions potential stock performance.

If I'm to analyze each tweet's impact on their respective target stocks:

- First tweet might not directly mention AAPL or GILT, but it could indirectly indicate investor sentiment towards tech companies generally, which might influence the overall market, but not a specific stock.

- Second tweet is about GILTT, which could influence its own stock price positively due to increased revenue.

But again, without knowing which company each tweet is targeting, this becomes speculative.

Perhaps I need to make an assumption here. Since the user provided two tweets, maybe they are both from the same company, and one of them refers to their stock. But given that the first tweet mentions ""A"" in ""aapl"", perhaps it's a typo or intentional.

Alternatively, perhaps both tweets are about different companies but the user intended for me to analyze each separately.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this further. Let's think of it as two separate analysis tasks:

1. Analyze first tweet towards AAPL (investor firm) and possibly towards GILTT ( Gillette Corporation).

2. The second tweet mentions GILTT with revenue growth.

But since I don't have context on how these relate to their stock prices, perhaps the best approach is to assume that each tweet refers to a specific company and analyze them accordingly.

So:

- First tweet: Promotional note towards investing in tech companies but doesn't mention AAPL or GILT specifically. So maybe no direct impact on their stocks.

- Second tweet: GILTT's stock performance is influenced by its revenue, which could be positive for Gillette's stock price.

But since the user hasn't specified a target stock symbol, I might have to consider that the second tweet is about GILTT and evaluate its potential impact. However, without knowing how the company did in previous years or other factors, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps both tweets are referring to AAPL, but the first mentions ""aapl"" which could be a typo for ""apple"", but I don't know if that relates to any specific company in this context.

Given all these uncertainties, maybe the best approach is to proceed with the assumption that the second tweet is about GILTT and evaluate its potential positive impact on its stock price based on revenue growth. However, without additional information like profit margins or other performance indicators, it's speculative.

Wait a minute, perhaps there's more context I can infer here. The first tweet mentions ""aapl $ baba $ fb $ gild"" which could be referring to AATL (Apple Technology Solutions), but that seems unrelated. Similarly, FB and GIL are names of companies as well as brands, not necessarily stock symbols.

So maybe the first tweet is more of a marketing note towards investors for a range of tech companies.

In conclusion, perhaps it's best to analyze each tweet separately considering their target stocks. The second tweet mentions GILTT and its revenue increase, which could indicate positive sentiment towards Gillette's stock performance. Therefore, I might consider that as the target company, despite not having specific information on AAPL or GILT.

However, since the user wants an analysis for a specific stock symbol, perhaps I should proceed with the first tweet being about AATL and the second about GILTT, even if there's no direct connection. Alternatively, maybe both tweets are about different companies, but without context, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, perhaps both tweets are about AATL (Apple Technology Solutions), but that seems unlikely as it was mentioned earlier.

I think I'm going in circles here. Perhaps the best approach is to accept that the user wants an analysis for a specific stock symbol and refer to one of their tweets, likely GILTT based on the second tweet mentioning revenue growth.

Therefore, maybe I should proceed by considering each tweet separately as target stocks:

1. First tweet: Promotional note towards investing in tech companies but no specific target stock.

2. Second tweet: Concerning GILTT's potential for positive stock performance due to increased revenue.

Given that, perhaps the user intended to ask about these two tweets and analyze them for their impact on their respective targets.

But since I can't determine which company each tweet is targeting without context, perhaps I should consider that both are referring to AATL (Apple Technology Solutions) based on the first mention of ""aapl"" in the second tweet's $ googl line. But again, this seems unfounded unless there's a typo.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended for me to analyze both companies from these tweets separately, even though I don't have context on their performance yet.

In conclusion, given the ambiguity, perhaps it's best to proceed by analyzing each tweet separately as target stocks:

First tweet: Promotional note towards tech companies but no specific target. Maybe not relevant unless considering AATL or another company mentioned in multiple tweets.

Second tweet: Concerning GILTT's potential for positive stock performance due to increased revenue. So, if I'm focusing on GILTT, perhaps it can be a target stock symbol based on the second tweet mentioning $500 billion in revenue and potential stock performance.

Therefore, maybe the user intended to ask about both AATL (from the first tweet) and GILTT (from the second tweet). So, in that case, I should analyze each separately.

Given that, perhaps the target company is GILTT based on the second tweet's mention of revenue growth. But without context on their performance yet, it's speculative.

Alternatively, if both tweets are about AATL, but again, the first tweet mentions ""aapl"", which might not refer to a company unless it's a typo for Apple Technology Solutions or something else entirely.

Wait, maybe ""aapl"" is an acronym for Apple's Advanced Placement exam? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps ""aapl"" is a different abbreviation, but I don't recall such terms in finance.

Given the lack of clarity, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with GILTT as the target company based on the second tweet mentioning revenue growth. So, if I'm focusing on GILTT and it's mentioned that its stock performance could improve due to increased revenue, then I can consider this as a target for analysis.

However, without any other information like profit margins, competitive position, or other financial metrics, it's hard to evaluate the sentiment towards GILTT's stock. Revenue growth is a positive sign, but without context, it's speculative.

Alternatively, maybe both tweets are about AATL and GILTT are two different companies with no direct relation in this scenario, so I can't link their performance.

Given that, perhaps the best approach is to analyze each tweet separately regardless of their target company. However, since the user seems to have a particular stock symbol in mind, maybe they're referring to multiple tweets about a single company.

But given all these uncertainties, perhaps it's best to proceed with considering both GILTT and AATL as possible targets for analysis based on their respective tweets.

Therefore, my analysis will include evaluating each tweet towards GILTT and possibly AATL, depending on context. So, in this case, since the user didn't specify a target stock symbol, I'll assume that they're asking about multiple companies mentioned in these tweets.

In conclusion, given the ambiguity, perhaps the best way is to proceed with both GILTT and AATL as potential targets for analysis based on their respective tweets. Therefore, I will consider each of them separately."
2015-12-31,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of gequ global equity intl. The user has provided two specific tweets and wants me to assess them. Let's break this down step by step.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""gequ global equity intl , inc . day high URL $ gequ $ spwr $ svy.to $ baba gequ finance stockgild gilead sciences , …"". This seems like a list of stocks and some metrics. The word ""day high"" might indicate some positive news about the stock's performance, possibly leading to an expected increase in price. I'll note that as a Positive factor.

Next, looking at the second tweet: ""breakout = 85.91 r2 = 83.71 r1 = 82.69 $ baba pivot = 82.10 s1 = 81.08 s2 = 80.49 breakdown = 77.86"". This is a statistical analysis with specific numbers. The presence of terms like R², S₁, and S₂ suggests some form of predictive modeling or market trend indicators. A high R² indicates a strong fit in the model, which can imply confidence in an upcoming trend. The word ""pivot"" might indicate a turning point or significant change expected, further supporting a positive outlook. So, this tweet adds substantial Positive factors related to expected movements.

Considering both tweets together, they collectively suggest that gequ's stock is on the upswing, with metrics indicating potential growth and confidence in future trends. These signals are strong enough to lean towards an overall Positive sentiment."
