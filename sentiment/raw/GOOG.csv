Date,Sentiment,Analysis
2014-01-01,Negative,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about the stock price forapl. I'm not super familiar with all these abbreviations and terms, but I'll go through each tweet one by one.

First, there are three identical tweets saying something about a webcast featuring several company names. They mention things like trader education options and hedging strategies. Hmm, I don't know much about financial investments or what specific trades traders do, so maybe these tweets aren't giving direct information about the stock's performance. Maybe they're just updating on some event related to those companies?

Then there are three more tweets: number 4 is a wrap-up and trading set review part iii, listing several company names with their symbols. That seems pretty standard; it's like a summary of past trades. I don't see any positive or negative keywords here, so probably not much impact on the stock.

Number 5 repeats similar to tweet 2, again talking about webcast topics and specific companies. It doesn't seem to be providing any new information about the stock either.

The sixth tweet mentions goog removing edits in a document and minimizing a bar of icons. I'm not sure what that means or if it's relevant to stocks. Maybe it's just some design work on their website, but without more context, it's hard to tell how it affects the stock price.

Lastly, number 7 talks about AT_USER dropping mottox price to $399 for 2014 and mentions goog's URL. This seems like a specific action by someone, possibly updating stock prices or updates their information. If they're lowering the mottox price, that might indicate concern about the stock, but I'm not sure if it's positive or negative.

So putting it all together, the tweets don't provide any direct information aboutapl's performance. They are either summarizing events from other companies, repeating previous trends, or providing specific updates on individual stocks. Without more context or explicit mentions of positive or negative indicators, it's hard to assess if there's a positive or negative impact.

I think maybe these tweets are just keeping the company's stock prices updated in different ways, so they don't significantly affect the overall sentiment."
2014-01-02,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to assess the impact of these tweets on Google's stock price. Let me start by breaking down each tweet one by one.

The first tweet says that Google has issued a patent for adding new attributes to a structured presentation URL. Patents are usually positive because they can protect specific innovations and might lead to long-term revenue growth. So, this seems like a good sign for the stock price.

Moving on to the second tweet, it mentions trade signals generated from Twitter having a 75.8% win rate in 2013 and still open URLs including $ goog, $ ma, $ bidu, and $ yelp. This sounds like Google's products are effective and getting traction. The win rate indicates that these signals are working well, which is positive for their revenue streams.

The third tweet states that $ goog can unlock 68% more value by emulating Google in this way with a URL stock stocks action. Imagination can lead to innovation, so this seems like it could result in higher future earnings. It's about the potential of their approach to deliver better products or services.

Putting it all together, each tweet is highlighting different aspects of Google's growth and innovation. Patents are always positive, successful product launches contribute positively to profits, and new technologies can open up new revenue streams. The combination of these factors suggests a favorable overall sentiment for the stock price."
2014-01-03,Positive,"Alright, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on Google's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first few tweets mention the early days of employees at Google, Amazon, and Subway. These seem like they're talking about their history or founding stories, which is generally a positive sign because it can boost confidence in the company.

2. The next tweet mentions a patent application for Google's query expansion. Patents are important as they indicate technology advancement, so this could be a positive factor.

3. Another tweet talks about GM (General Motors) for 2014, but I'm not sure how relevant that is to Google. It seems out of context unless it's related to their operations, which doesn't seem directly connected.

4. The next tweet refers to $ goog being the doorway for $ amzn in the next year, implying a competitive position between them, though this could be positive but might also imply something else not covered yet.

5. A tweet from Tim K mentions Android phones are used as dumbphones by Apple. This is a bit confusing because it's about competitors, which can sometimes hint at issues or strategies rather than a clear signal on the company's performance.

6. The next tweet talks about China mobile deals driving Apple in 2014 and mentions stock action. Similar to the previous one, this seems out of context unless there was prior information not provided here.

7. The last tweet is about Google's S&P futures, with a price target. This directly relates to the stock price movement and can provide direct insights into how investors are viewing the stock relative to its competitors or overall market conditions.

Putting it all together: The early days of companies generally boost investor confidence. Patent expansions show innovation potential. Chinese deals might indicate opportunities or issues, but if there's a positive price target like Google has, that directly affects the stock. So combining these, I think the overall sentiment is positive for Google."
2014-01-04,Negative,"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to analyze the impact of given tweets on a company's stock price and determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative.

First, I need to figure out how to extract the target stock from the provided tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""google inc : charleston seo company matthew rubin marketing services ... $ goog URL"". The most prominent part here is ""google inc"" followed by a dot and then ""$ goog URL"". From this, it seems like the target stock symbol is ""GOOGL"" because Google's ticker symbol is GOOG. The rest is probably extra information or maybe a typo.

Next, I need to consider how each tweet affects the sentiment. In this case, there's only one tweet provided: ""google inc : charleston seo company matthew rubin marketing services ... $ goog URL"". The presence of ""GOOGL"" in lowercase suggests it's the target stock. 

Now, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. But since there's only one relevant tweet, it's hard to assess sentiment individually. However, just having the stock symbol might not provide much context about investor reactions. It could be that this tweet is a dummy or irrelevant.

I'm also supposed to look at other aspects like market conditions, macroeconomic indicators, or company-specific events. But with only one tweet, I don't have enough information to make a clear assessment.

The output needs to conclude with a single line: [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. However, without additional context from multiple tweets or more detailed analysis of the factors, it's challenging to determine the overall sentiment. It might be neutral because there's limited data, but some investors could see it as positive if they're looking for potential growth.

Considering that ""GOOGL"" is a well-known stock and often used in news about tech companies, maybe it has a slight positive impact. But without more information from other tweets or context, I'm not sure. It's probably safer to consider the tweet as neutral because it doesn't provide enough details to make a confident judgment."
2014-01-05,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on a company's stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at tweet 1: ""2013 ' s best smartphone URL $ apple $. Googling and FB are the primary targets."" Hmm, this seems a bit confusing. It mentions Google and Facebook as primary targets but doesn't specify what 2013's best smartphone is. Maybe it's a typo or missing context. I'm not sure if that's positive or negative because there's no specific information given.

Next, tweet 2: ""AT_USER Sunday links : reflexive buybacks , economic optimism & short vs long-term thinking URL $ amzn $ goog $ fb."" This one talks about buybacks, which might be related to stock price adjustments. Economic optimism is a positive sign, and mentioning things like short vs long-term thinking could indicate investor sentiment. So this tweet seems positive.

I'm not entirely sure about the first tweet because of the missing context on the smartphone URL. If it's just stating targets without specific info, maybe it's neutral or even negative if it's misleading or incorrect. But since I don't have more details, I'll consider each tweet's sentiment separately and then weigh them to decide the overall impact.

So, tweet 1 could be neutral because there's uncertainty about what 2013's best smartphone is. Tweet 2 is positive with buybacks, economic optimism, and thinking about timeframes. Combining these might lead to a mixed overall sentiment but leaning towards positive."
2014-01-06,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, I have these tweets about some company and I need to determine their impact on the stock price. The possible responses are Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

First, looking at the tweets provided. There's only one tweet here: ""rt AT_USER $ goog continues to look strong as it clings to the 10 - day line ."". That seems pretty straightforward. It mentions Google continuing its strong performance because of reaching a 10-day line. 

I think about what that means. The 10-day moving average is often used to identify trends. If an asset is still above this line, it can indicate upward momentum, suggesting the stock is strengthening. So in this case, if Google's price has been heading up because of this, I would lean towards a Positive sentiment.

But wait, let me double-check. The tweet also mentions that ""the most moral thing to do would be to invest in $ twtr $ fb $ goog where engineers r given millions in options."" That part is about the company's employees and investment opportunities. It doesn't directly relate to Google's stock price but might suggest a positive outlook overall.

The first tweet alone seems to focus solely on Google, so combining all relevant tweets isn't possible here since there are none besides this one. So I'll stick with just the first tweet.

Also, the mention of $ goog continuing to look strong makes me think that the stock is performing well in the short term, perhaps even building momentum. If a company is trending upwards based on recent technical indicators like moving averages, it can lead to positive sentiment for investors.

In conclusion, given Google's continued strength due to reaching a 10-day line and the general positive outlook from the tweet about employees and investments, I think this tweet is leaning towards a Positive impact on the stock price."
2014-01-07,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of Google. Let me take it step by step.

First, I'll extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. The first tweet is about GOOG being an ETF, which suggests it's related to assets like stocks or ETFs, probably Google itself. So the stock symbol is GOOGL.

Looking at the tweets:

1. "" $ goog is pretty much an etf at this point . "" - This seems neutral because it's making a statement about GOOGL being an ETF but doesn't give any positive or negative info on its performance.

2. "" that's a mind-boggling number rt AT_USER $ goog hits new high . $ 1135 . incredible job larry page has done over last few years ... "" - This is definitely a positive tweet because it's talking about GOOGL hitting a new high, which generally boosts investor confidence and stock price.

3. "" AT_USER rotate that $ twtr $ $ into $ fb $ goog "" - It seems like a query or instruction to switch from TWTR to FB for GOOG, not much to analyze here in terms of affecting the stock itself. Maybe it's testing knowledge but doesn't impact the stock.

4. "" rt AT_USER $ goog is closing in on $ fb in social logins . together both account for 80 % of social sign ins URL ht …"" - Again, this seems like a statement about GOOGL getting closer to FB through social logins, which could indicate a potential shift in market dynamics but doesn't provide a clear positive or negative impact.

5. "" google's pt raised by jpmorgan chase & co . to $ 1,305 . 00 . URL $ goog goog"" - This tweet is talking about GOOG raising its price target from some amount to $1,305. While it does mention an increase in the target price, it doesn't give specific information about whether this will positively or negatively affect GOOGL's stock price.

6. "" $ goog google : jp morgan ups target to $ 1,305 , deutsche pounds the table URL"" - Similar to tweet 5, this is a statement about raising the price target but without providing any data on how it affects the stock price or investor sentiment.

7. "" $ goog ’ s ubiquitous presence & investments in new technology warrant a place for it in your portfolio URL"" - This tweet is discussing GOOGL's presence and investments, which could indicate growth potential. It might suggest that GOOGL could see an increase in value, contributing to positive sentiment about the stock.

8. "" $ goog will be a $ 2000 stock by year-end ' 15 . can't wait for the first $ 2k price target . $ aapl will be a $ 1000 stock ... never . "" - This seems like an aggressive statement, predicting significant jumps in GOOGL and Apple. These are major milestones that could lead to strong positive impacts on the stock.

Now, I'll assess each tweet's sentiment relative to GOOGL:

1. Neutral
2. Positive
3. Neutral (maybe just testing)
4. Positive (based on social login trends suggesting a shift in market dynamics towards GOOGL)
5. Positive (target increase is an indicator of potential growth)
6. Positive (same as 5, about price targets)
7. Neutral (talking about presence and investments without specific data)
8. Positive (aggressive predictions for significant stock milestones)

Considering all these, the most positive tweets are 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. But some of them don't directly address GOOGL's performance but rather market trends or investor expectations.

The overall sentiment seems mixed. There are strong positive statements about GOOGL reaching new highs, potential price increases, and major milestones. However, it also includes neutral elements that might imply uncertainty or medium-term factors affecting the stock.

Given the context of these tweets, the strongest indicators are the increasing focus on GOOGL's performance, the predictions for significant price targets, and the social login trends suggesting a shift in market dynamics. These all contribute to building positive sentiment towards Google."
2014-01-08,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of Google. 

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol. Looking through each tweet, I see mentions like ""goog"" in several places, so that must be the company we're analyzing here.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one to extract positive (Positive) and negative (Negative) factors. For each tweet, I'll check if it has an effect on investor sentiment or stock performance.

 Tweet 1: The user seems to mention a ""wild"" feeling and jumping on something related to the market. It's talking about trading history and selling, which might indicate selling pressure or concerns about volatility, but not sure yet.

Tweet 2: Google is using a private ferry to shuttle employees. This could be seen as a positive aspect of company culture or employee well-being, possibly affecting investor sentiment positively.

Tweet 3: The tweet talks about internet privacy lawsuits and mentions AT_USER URL. It could relate to regulations or potential legal issues, which might lead to negative sentiment if there's fear of fines or regulatory scrutiny.

Tweet 4: The user is pointing out that Google is away from Twitter and competing with Facebook on S&P trends. This competition could cause market volatility but might not directly affect the stock price unless it impacts investor confidence.

Tweet 5: This tweet lists various stocks, includinggoog. If many companies are buying goog, it could signal a strong market presence or increased interest in goog's products, which might be positive for investors.

Tweet 6: Similar to Tweet 2, this is a morning call discussing multiple stocks. It's likely covering news related to tech companies like aapl and twtr, which could have short-term effects on the stock price but not necessarily long-term trends.

Tweet 7: Google mentions that over 1 billion android devices will be sold in 2014, with a 26% jump from 2013. This is about future sales, which are generally positive for companies as it boosts revenue and could lead to higher stock prices.

Tweet 8: Facebook is buying an Android app monitoring tool maker. This could indicate strategic moves by both tech giants and attract market attention, which might influence investor sentiment positively.

Tweet 9: Google exiting their day trade long position on the long-term horizon. Exits can sometimes cause a sell-off in markets but also show volatility, potentially affecting stock price.

Now, combining these factors: 

- Tweets 2 and 8 are positive as they mention employee culture and strategic partnerships, which could boost investor confidence.
- Tweet 3 is negative due to privacy concerns and legal risks.
- Tweet 5 lists multiple stocks, suggesting increased competition or interest in goog's products.
- Tweet 7 looks into future sales, which can drive demand and potentially increase stock price.
- Tweets 6 and 8 don't seem as volatile; they're more about current news.

Overall, while there are mixed factors—some positive, some negative—it seems Google is facing both challenges and opportunities. The exit from long positions (Tweet 9) could cause selling pressure, but the other tweets suggest a mix of growth potential and regulatory concerns. Considering all these elements, the overall sentiment leans towards [Neutral]."
2014-01-09,Neutral,"Okay, I need to figure out how these tweets impact the stock price of Google. Let's go through each tweet one by one.

First tweet: ""yes , ladies and gents : today's selloff is brought to u b y folks who fear too much eco prosperity i . e . expect a 240 + jobs # tomorrow $ goog $ fb"". It sounds like people are worried about eco issues affecting the stock. Maybe it's positive because they're concerned about future growth due to these eco factors, but I'm not sure if that's enough to outweigh other concerns.

Second tweet: ""employees at google can take a free private ferry service to work , $ goog , URL"". This seems like a temporary good news. More employees working from home could boost revenue and possibly stock price. That's definitely positive.

Third tweet: ""$ fb $ scty $ z $ deck $ goog $ v – morning market video - update from option millionaires come visit our live chat t ..."". It mentions the Facebook stock (scty) and others, but since they're talking about a live chat or an event, it's unclear what impact that has on Google. Maybe some positive news, but not sure.

Fourth tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ goog nearly a $ 400b company . yet no one is concerned by it's size like $ aapl . it can supposedly keep growing at these rate …"". The user mentions Google reaching $400 billion, which could boost the stock. However, the comment says people aren't worried about its size or potential growth. This seems neutral.

Fifth tweet: ""internet stocks : double top ? $ spy , $ spx , $ es_f , $ fdn , $ goog , $ amzn"". It refers to Google being in a double-top formation on the S&P 500, which is unusual and could be due to technical analysis. This makes sense as it's a signal for investors to watch, indicating potential positive developments.

So, combining these thoughts: There are positive elements like more workers and potential growth (tweets 2 and 4), but some tweets suggest concerns about eco issues (tweet 1) and the stock's valuation (tweet 5). It might be mixed, but leaning towards positive because of the positive news from employees and technical analysis. However, the negative tweet could weigh it down a bit."
2014-01-10,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of Apple Inc. The user provided four tweets and an output requirement where I have to conclude with either [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, I need to understand what each tweet is saying. The task says to extract the stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at each tweet:

1. "" update "" seems like a placeholder for the address of the user, not relevant.
2. ""appeals court : apple’s iPhone does not infringe on motorola’s patent URL $ aapl $ goog"" – this mentions that Apple's iPhone doesn't infringe onMotorola's patent, which might be positive because it could benefit Apple financially.
3. ""what's google x doing meeting with the fda's medical device staff ? URL via AT_USER AT_USER $ goog"" – Google X is mentioned here, but without specific information about what they're discussing and the link, it's hard to assess its impact on stock prices.
4. ""rt AT_USER how to opt out of google’s latest changes , so strangers won’t end up in your gmail inbox : URL $ goog"" – This seems like a query or advice, suggesting that users can opt out of Google's changes. If it makes sense and spreads awareness about privacy issues, it could be positive by encouraging user behavior.

Now, let's break down the tweet by tweet. 

The first tweet is probably irrelevant because it doesn't mention Apple. The second tweet is also relevant as it mentions Apple making a claim that might affect their stock price positively. The third tweet isn't specific enough to determine its impact on Apple, so I might consider it neutral or uncertain. The fourth tweet is about user behavior and privacy, which could influence the company's reputation but doesn't directly state how it affects their stock price.

Next step: Identify positive factors (P) from the relevant tweets. From the second tweet, it mentions that Apple’s iPhone doesn’t infringe onMotorola’s patent, which would be a positive signal for Apple financially. That's one positive point.

For negative factors (N), I don't see any relevant tweets that clearly state something negative about Apple or their stock price.

So combining P and N: 1 Positive, 0 Negative. 

Now, considering the user provided an example output as [Positive], which made sense because it had a clear positive tweet. But in this case, only one tweet is relevant. So with only one positive factor, what's the overall sentiment?

In many cases, even if there's one positive tweet, the stock might still be neutral or slightly negative if other factors are considered. However, since I don't have other tweets that could cancel out the positive impact, it leans more towards a Positive overall.

Wait, but sometimes even one positive can lead to uncertainty. Maybe in this case, given that Apple is still building something significant like the iPhone, which has already had some success, the market might be positive because of the expected future gains from their products and partnerships.

But without all tweets analyzed, it's hard to say for sure. The example output was [Positive], so perhaps I should go with that unless more information suggests otherwise."
2014-01-11,Negative,"Okay, let me try to figure out the likely impact on the stock price of the given company based on the provided tweets. So, first, I need to analyze each tweet separately and then combine them into an overall sentiment.

Looking at the first tweet: ""$ goog this is how beats music looks like and what it will cost URL"". Hmm, that seems a bit off-topic because it's discussing Beats Music's URL or where they'll go next. The mention of Beats Music isn't directly related to the stock in question. Since I don't have information about Beats Music's current performance or any specific event related to their stock, this tweet is probably not relevant.

Now, moving on to the second tweet: ""The [Negative] impact of an upcoming tech conference could tip the balance"". This one talks about a potential negative factor from an upcoming conference. I'm assuming this refers to a company's future earnings or product launches because tech conferences often affect market expectations. Negative factors typically lead to a decrease in stock price, which would be considered a negative sentiment.

Considering both tweets, the first is about Beats Music but not directly related to the stock price of the company we're analyzing. The second tweet introduces an upcoming event that could have a negative impact on the company's performance. Putting them together, it seems like the potential conference could cause concerns, which would likely decrease investor confidence and thus result in a negative overall sentiment.

So, combining these thoughts, the tweets suggest a negative trend, so the stock price is expected to go down."
2014-01-12,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze the given tweets about a stock and determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative in impact on the future stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol, it's FB (Facebook). Now, going through each tweet one by one:

1. The first tweet is ""rt AT_USER $ oxbt monday gapper ? URL $ phot $ fnma $ twtr $ goog $ aapl $ fb daytrading pennystocks daytradealerts tr …"" Hmm, this seems like some kind of personal message or possibly a typo with some symbols. The mention of FB is present here. The rest are URLs indicating the company's stock ticker and other companies. It looks like this tweet is just a random text without any explicit information about FB.

I don't think this tweet provides any meaningful information relevant to Facebook's financial performance, earnings, or anything else significant. It seems off-topic. So, I'll consider this as neutral because it doesn't add useful data.

2. The second tweet is ""The most popular stock on the stock market is not just a question of time but a question of value."" This one is more of a general statement about the stock market dynamics, suggesting that the most popular stock isn't necessarily the best investment. It's somewhat neutral because it doesn't give any specific information about Facebook or its future performance.

3. The third tweet is ""We’ve found out how to make money at a higher price."" Again, this seems like a general tip on making money but doesn't provide any details about Facebook. It might suggest that trading is profitable, but without specifics, it's hard to assess the impact on FB stock.

4. The fourth tweet is ""The company’s revenue growth could be affected by the global economy.” This provides some information about potential changes in the company's revenue based on economic factors. However, this is speculative and doesn't give concrete data or predictions about Facebook's future performance. It might hint at a possible shift but isn't certain.

Looking through all four tweets, none of them provide concrete information that would indicate Facebook's stock will perform positively, neutrally, or negatively. Each tweet either lacks relevant context, offers general statements without specifics, or suggests potential risks and opportunities but doesn't predict outcomes. Therefore, the overall sentiment is neutral."
2014-01-13,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of the given company, which I assume is Google (GOOGL). I'll go through each tweet step by step.

Starting with tweet 1: The user says that $APL's (Apple) put option is about to expire. That seems like a positive event because it could make someone buy more shares. But wait, the price is at $16.60, and they're offering an in-the-money put. So selling this might lower the stock price, but there's also a lot of market noise with emojis pointing down. I'm not sure if that's positive or negative yet.

Tweet 2 mentions Google challenging Microsoft and Apple in the connected car market, which is a relevant industry. The user doesn't specify how it affects the stock, just says it could be a big push. That seems like a positive signal for the company's future. But I should consider the other factors too.

Tweet 3 talks about Tim Cook seeking perfect living room perfection and taking over the home with Google. That sounds like a great move and would definitely boost investor confidence. The user is making a strong case, which is positive. Also, $GOOG is taking over a hardware company, which is a good sign.

Tweet 4 says Google is buying Nest for $3.2 billion. Again, Nest is a hardware company that could drive growth in home automation. This is a direct acquisition and a solid signal for future performance. The user is making a confident statement here.

Tweet 5 repeats tweet 4 with more details about the purchase from AT_USER. It reinforces the idea that Google is taking big steps forward, which should positively impact the stock.

Tweet 6 mentions Google wanted to be a hardware company but ends on a note of excitement and looking for footholds. That's positive because it shows they're willing to invest in new technologies, which could drive innovation.

Tweet 7 talks about Google hiring someone who designed the iPod. This is interesting as it shows strategic planning, which can attract talent and improve efficiency. It might not directly impact the stock, but it's a good sign for future growth.

Tweet 8 mentions Google buying Nest Labs in cash, which is another acquisition that could increase revenue from home automation. This is positive and likely to boost the company's performance.

Tweet 9 discusses Google pursuing innovation or just not paying too much for what they want. The user emphasizes overpaying as a bad strategy but doesn't say whether it will lead to success. There's some uncertainty here, which could be neutral or negative.

Tweet 10 says Google is buying Nest with smart thermostats and smoke detectors, building a foothold in the market. This is a direct buy that would likely increase sales. It's positive for growth prospects.

Tweet 11 corrects a metric and mentions other companies like CSCO, MSFT, etc., which are relevant to tech stocks. Correcting metrics doesn't directly impact stock price but is good practice, so not sure about sentiment here.

Tweet 12 talks about Google making a big push in online travel. While this could lead to revenue growth and positive brand exposure, it's a short-term move that might not have long-term implications for the stock.

Tweet 13 says Google will be buying Nest Labs for $3.2 billion. This is another acquisition, reinforcing the user's confident statements about future success.

Tweet 14 asks if someone missed an opportunity to bring home to Apple. The question suggests uncertainty, possibly indicating that people were on the fence or not sure what would happen, which could lead to neutral sentiment.

Tweet 15 mentions coincident bubbles in art and stock market. While speculative, this is related to tech stocks, so it might affect investor confidence but not necessarily sell or buy signals.

Tweet 16 says Google is raising its target to $1,220 for Q4 and expects volume. This is a forward-looking statement about future earnings targets, which can signal potential growth and positive sentiment.

Tweet 17 mentions Twitter being worth $65 per share due to market interest. This could indicate that the stock is undervalued and could drive up its price, which would be positive.

Tweet 18 says Google bought Nest Labs for $3.2 billion in cash. Another acquisition that supports growth in home automation, so positive for future performance.

Tweet 19 talks about Twitter being worth more because of a stock market bubble. This reinforces the idea that investors are buying stocks at a high price relative to earnings potential, which is positive.

Tweet 20 says Google bought Nest for $3.5 billion. Similar to previous purchases, this shows ongoing investment in home automation technologies and likely future success.

tweet 21 breaks down more on Google acquiring Nest, providing detailed information about the deal, which could be favorable news for investors.

Tweet 22 mentions that the price raised by Oppenheimer is expected to improve their rating. This suggests the stock is performing well enough to attract buy interest, indicating positive sentiment.

Tweets 23 and 24 are corrections of previous statements, perhaps to correct any prior misstatements or fill in details, but don't add much to sentiment.

tweet 25 talks about Apple making a big push into the car market. The user is reinforcing Google's potential future performance by talking about Google's own move.

tweet 26 says $GOOG is investing $3.2 billion in Nest Labs for $1,220 next year. This is another acquisition that could drive growth and positive sentiment towards future earnings.

So overall, considering all these tweets, the company seems to be gaining traction with multiple acquisitions, strong public statements about innovation and expansion into new markets, and a focus on building brand presence. The user's consistent positive messaging is likely to indicate confidence in future performance, which should be a [Positive] sentiment."
2014-01-14,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about the stock price of a company based on the given criteria. I'm not very familiar with all the financial terms and trends mentioned here, so I'll need to break it down step by step.

First, I see that each tweet is a separate point in time or event. My task is to determine how each tweet impacts the overall sentiment towards the stock price of a company. The possible outcomes are positive, neutral, or negative.

Starting with tweet 1: ""iot , $ goog and home automation would be positively scary."" This seems like a positive statement about potential developments related to Google, especially in their products. Positive statements usually boost investor confidence, which could be seen as positive for the stock price.

Tweet 2 mentions that $ goog's 2nd largest purchase is Nest, which runs on Apple's arm cortex A8 microprocessors. There's a coincidence and anticipation of a takeover coming up next month. Anticipating a takeover often sends investors on a positive note because it gives them hope about future growth. This could contribute to a positive sentiment.

Tweet 3 says ""rt AT_USER i agree with AT_USER on this : sorry , but this guy is a total idiot on apple URL $ aapl $ goog."" This seems critical and dismissive of the previous statement. Dismissals can sometimes lead investors to take risks, which might be seen as negative if it's a sign of skepticism.

Tweet 4 is ""rt AT_USER where ’ s bitcoin going in 2014 , and beyond ? URL bitcoin btc $ bitcoin wallstreet $ goog."" The mention of Bitcoin could cause concern because cryptocurrency stocks are generally volatile. However, this tweet seems to focus on Bitcoin's potential future performance, which might make investors cautious but not necessarily negative overall.

Tweet 5 is "" $ goog look out , apple - google just bought nest for $ 3.2 billion URL."" This seems like a news event related to Google's acquisition, which can cause stock prices to rise as companies like Google are valued. Positive news about their operations usually boosts sentiment.

Tweet 6 mentions that soon $ goog knows when you're sleeping or awake based on Google's performance, implying increased awareness of company performance. Increased visibility could lead to more positive sentiment as investors see better opportunities.

Tweet 7 says "" $ goog pay attention to resistance level @ $ 1144.54 price needs to breakout or breakdown . you know how to play this . cheers ."" This is a technical analysis suggestion, which can be seen as a methodical approach, possibly contributing to positive sentiment as it guides investors.

Tweet 8 talks about the 3x and 2x multiples for Google's cash reserves versus its stock price. This could indicate management's expectations about future growth or confidence in their financial performance, which is often positive.

Tweet 9 questions how $ goog values its Google Fiber business line. This relates to the company's revenue streams. If investors expect higher returns from this segment, it can positively impact the overall stock price.

Tweet 10 mentions that $ goog is a crook pumps at earnings, implying a lack of ethical conduct regarding financial reports. This could be seen as negative news, possibly leading some investors to avoid Google or sell their stocks, contributing to negative sentiment.

Tweet 11 suggests raising valuations for Google's stock in 2013-14 by increasing the range from $900-$1,000 to $1,300-$1,350. A wider valuation range is sometimes seen as more favorable and could boost investor confidence.

Tweet 12 refers to technical levels for AMZN, Aapl, FB, and goog. Technical analysis can influence stock price movements; if there are significant support or resistance levels set, it might affect sentiment positively or negatively depending on where the price hits those levels.

Tweet 13 mentions that stocks are rising, with futures going up, and ignoring lows but climbing highs. This suggests investor confidence in the company's fundamentals, which is positive.

Tweet 14 says that big days for big tech like Google matter a lot, especially their stock picking up steam. Positive market developments can boost sentiment.

Tweet 15 notes that 19 new highs were noted on S&P 500 today, with no new lows. This indicates strong recent momentum in the index, which can positively influence investor sentiment towards the tech stocks involved.

Tweet 16 talks about a dismal 2014 for Google's Angie's List stock. A negative year can lead to more cautious behavior, potentially negative sentiment if expectations of better returns are misplaced.

Tweet 17 mentions Instagram's role in Facebook as a ticket to Facebook's growth. Positive development could boost investor confidence and sentiment positively.

Tweet 18 discusses the $ goog call options trading strategy and how they affect prices based on market conditions. This can be seen as an analytical approach, possibly contributing positively to price movements.

Tweet 19 says that 3 calls were opened for Google's stock trading at $36.90. Opened trades often indicate potential buying interest or interest in the stock, which could contribute to positive sentiment if the market takes notice.

In summary, each tweet contributes either positively by mentioning future developments, gains, or technical analysis, negatively by talking about negative earnings or a bad year, or neutrally by providing general market trends. Combining all these factors, it's likely that Google's stock is performing well, which would make the overall sentiment positive."
2014-01-15,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of Google. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

Starting with the first tweet: ""alas AT_USER team , we knew you well whence u were once an innovative company , b4 giddy $ goog purchase for us $ 3.2 b URL"". Hmm, it mentions a purchase but isn't clear if it's positive or negative. It sounds like they bought something, which might indicate enthusiasm or a desire to invest, so that could be positive.

The second tweet is ""$ goog - can qihoo 360 close the revenue gap with baidu ? -> URL stock stocks stockaction"". This looks like a question about potential future actions from Google. It suggests that someone is interested in taking action now, which might lead to something turning around or improving, so this could be positive.

The third tweet: ""$ goog prime example of why it's not worth risk to take full positions into earnings . it was a gap n go . gave us several weeks to get in ."" This seems like a warning against investing. It talks about a revenue gap and suggests avoiding investment due to potential risks, which could be negative.

The fourth tweet is ""rt AT_USER obnoxious trader URL do you love him or hate him all you traders on $ fb $ twtr $ goog $ p $ renn $ meet ? ?"" It's playful with no clear positive or negative message. Maybe some frustration or humor, so unsure about the sentiment here.

Fifth tweet: ""a very good one about us and our potential - infinity augmented reality : a potential double URL … $ goog google $ also"". This seems enthusiastic about Google's potential future but not sure if it's positive or negative since it doesn't specify what's going on. It might be neutral because it's more about outlook than action.

Sixth tweet: ""rt AT_USER why google spent $ 3.2 billion to get inside your home : URL • $ goog ( via AT_USER"". Another playful tweet, asking about potential expenses for personal use, which could indicate a desire to invest or grow, so positive sentiment.

Seventh tweet is the same as six, probably repeating the same question, reinforcing that idea of investment interest.

Eighth tweet: ""google $ goog leads dec us web searches with 67.3 % share , according to comscore stocks"". This seems like a factual statement about Google's market position, so it's positive because it gives an objective view of the company's performance.

Ninth tweet: ""$ goog ~ 2x $ amzn ~ 4x $ appl ~ 2x $ msft ~ 1x $ ebay ~ 2x"". This is comparing growth rates across companies. It suggests potential growth, which might indicate a positive outlook on Google in relation to others, but not directly about its own stock.

Tenth tweet: ""a really scary real robot developed by a google company $ goog URL"". This mentions a serious threat from Google's technology. scares can be negative, but it's speculative whether this threat affects the company or just their operations, so uncertain.

Eleventh tweet: ""$ goog hitting buzz $ cmg $ drys $ xlk $ ej $ uso"". Comparing Google to other tech stocks could indicate competition or potential for growth, which might not be directly positive, depending on context. It's a bit vague.

Twelfth tweet: ""$ goog net neutrality ruling could force goog to join in the $ twc bidding , no pos .. just saying .. goog fiber ..."". This talks about policy changes and bids from other companies. It seems like Google is involved in regulatory issues that might impact their operations, which can sometimes cause instability, so negative.

Last tweet: ""$ goog - [ $ $ ] eu warns google on antitrust case -> URL stock stocks stockaction"". Another regulatory warning, similar to the previous one, suggesting uncertainty about regulations, which could be negative if it affects investment decisions.

Putting it all together, the tweets have a mix of positive messages like purchasing, potential investments, and comparing growth rates. But there are also negative ones regarding potential risks, policy changes, and a playful tone that's less clear in sentiment. There are some questions about investing but not definitive answers. So overall, the positive and neutral factors seem stronger than the negatives.

I'm leaning towards a [Neutral] stance because while there are positive statements about growth and investments, the negative tweets about regulations and potential risks balance it out without extreme positivity or negativity."
2014-01-16,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of $ goog.

First, I need to understand what each tweet is saying. The user wants me to identify the stock symbol from the tweets, but looking at them, it seems like $ goog is used in some tweets. For example, tweet 1 says ""goog - wally weitz on value investing and keeping pace with a raging bull market ... -> URL stock stocks stockaction."" Hmm, that looks like an email or something else, not exactly the stock symbol.

Wait, maybe I'm missing it. Let me check again. Actually, all tweets start with $ goog followed by something else. So $ goog must be the stock symbol for the company we're analyzing. That makes sense because many financial reports and analyses mention their stock symbol at the beginning of a tweet.

Now, each tweet is about different factors affecting the stock. Let's go through them one by one:

1. ""goog - wally weitz on value investing and keeping pace with a raging bull market ... -> URL stock stocks stockaction."" This seems to be an announcement from Wally Weitz regarding his views on the bull market. It doesn't mention positive or negative factors, but it's about his opinions.

2. ""this weeks trade on $ aapl url what does everyone think about $ goog er next week"" – This tweet is probably asking a question about the upcoming stock performance of Apple. It's not clear if this is positive or negative, just an inquiry.

3. ""google's positive rating reiterated at raymond james . url $ goog goog"" – This one mentions Raymond James as a ratings person for Google. While it doesn't specify whether it's positive or negative, it could imply positive sentiment about the company.

4. ""rt AT_USER now google sf commuters are getting security guards on their buses url $ goog"" – The user is sharing a fact about SF commuters having security guards. This seems like a minor factual update and doesn't really impact the stock price significantly.

5. ""$ goog google shares way overbought here and expected to retest lower support areas ..."" – This tweet is predicting that Google's stock will go back up because it's overbought. It suggests that investors expect more buying power, which could be positive but uncertain about the broader market.

6. ""$ goog - banks swapped for startups : graduates crave freedom -> url stock stocks stockaction."" This one mentions a swap of banks for startups and an inquiry about graduates wanting to have more freedom. It's speculative and not directly related to Google's performance.

7. ""u . s . active ( stock wars ): $ scty +8.98 % , $ goog +0.5 % , $ bby -27.76 % , $ bcbay +9950.71 % , $ tsla +2.84 % url stockwars"" – This seems like a tweet from a user discussing the ""stock wars,"" which refers to the competition between major tech companies. The sentiment here is that Google is performing better than others, so people are cautiously optimistic about the future.

8. ""google inc : the stock is testing its highs . $ goog url url"" – Again, just an announcement from Google itself about the company's state of mind without specifics on positive or negative factors.

Now, putting it all together. The tweets mention Wally Weitz talking about value investing, a swap in stocks, and people cautiously optimistic about Google's performance. They don't have strong, direct positive or negative statements but provide information that might suggest investor sentiment is mixed. However, the speculative nature of some tweets like #StockWars adds uncertainty.

Considering all these factors, while there are mentions of investors feeling optimistic about Google (from tweet 7 and the fact from tweet 3), they don't have consistent, strong information to outweigh any potential negative signals. The overall sentiment seems mixed but leaning towards positive because of the cautious optimism from certain tweets."

2014-01-18,Missing,File not found
2014-01-19,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER facebook's video views soar : is it relevant ? URL $ aol $ goog $ twtr $ fb"". Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about all these abbreviations and terms. Facebook's video views increasing sounds like positive news because more people are watching their videos online. But wait, the URL mentions $ aol, $ goog, $ twtr, which don't seem familiar. Maybe they're placeholders or specific brands related to Apple (AAPL) and Google. So I'm not sure if that's relevant to Facebook. It could be a red herring.

Moving on to the second tweet: ""rt AT_USER how are you doing? Your team is amazing. 📄 @gpt9203"". This seems more positive. It expresses good news about the user's performance and mentions a social media handle, which might not relate directly to Facebook stock but could be unrelated.

Third tweet: ""rt AT_USER I just wanted to reach out and let you know how much I missed you all the time! 💕 🚀"". This is definitely positive. It expresses gratitude and shows good relationship, which can boost investor confidence.

Fourth tweet: ""rt AT_USER My day is better than ever! 🌱🔥"". Again, this seems positive. It's an uplifting message about a good day with happy emotions.

Lastly, the fifth tweet: ""rt AT_USER I miss you, everyone! 💥 #stayhome"". This is also positive. It expresses joy and gives a cheerful message without any negative or irrelevant terms.

So, analyzing each tweet:
1. The first tweet has some unrelated information.
2. The second tweet is more about personal well-being.
3-5 tweets are uplifting and positive.

The overall sentiment seems mostly positive except for the first tweet which might not have direct relevance to Facebook's stock. However, since it's a minor or unimportant piece of information, I'll consider the majority as positive. So, combining all thoughts, the stock is likely to be positively impacted."
2014-01-20,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets about Google's stock price using the provided structure. Let me start by breaking down each tweet.

First, each tweet mentions ""Google"" but also refers to other terms like ""GOOG,"" ""GOOGLE,"" etc., which likely means they're talking about the company itself, not any other stocks.

Looking at the first tweet: It says, ""correlation the last 3 - years of $ spy vs $ xlf , $ gs , $ goog , $ aapl."" I know that SPY is actually the stock symbol for Apple, so this seems like a generic mention about comparing Google's performance against other tech stocks over the past three years. It doesn't directly talk about Google itself but gives an overview of their performance.

The second tweet: ""$ goog - the enigma of google glass , doomed , fashionable and late."" This seems like a motivational or negative statement towards Google, possibly referring to something related to ""glass,"" which I'm not sure stands for, but it suggests that the market is uncertain about Google's future. It also mentions ""doomed"" and ""fashionable and late,"" which might imply they're looking ahead, which could lead to some negative sentiment.

The third tweet: ""rt AT_USER robots with soul - URL - src : ted conferences - ted robotics $ goog."" Here, the mention of robots and robots seems a bit off-topic. It's more about Twitter users sharing something related to robots, maybe in forums or discussions. The reference to ""ted conferences"" doesn't directly tie into Google stock.

The fourth tweet: ""$ goog a new lens on google -> URL stock stocks stockaction."" This is again a generic mention comparing Google's performance with other tech companies, but it doesn't indicate any positive or negative thoughts about the company itself.

Putting this together, most of these tweets are expressing skepticism and uncertainty about the future of Google. The use of terms like ""doomed"" and ""fashionable and late"" suggests they're holding onto optimism for a long time and maybe in a more uncertain market environment. Additionally, referring to robots or other topics that aren't related to Google itself doesn't provide much insight into their current performance.

So, considering the sentiment from these tweets, I think there's some negative intent towards Google but not strong enough to outweigh positive aspects. The overall sentiment seems neutral because while there are some negative indicators like ""doomed,"" they don't strongly support a positive outlook for the stock."
2014-01-21,Positive,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on a company's stock price. Let me start by understanding the task step by step.

First, the user provided a list of tweets related to a specific company. They want me to assess each tweet's impact on the stock using one of three labels: [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. The process involves identifying the target stock, breaking down each tweet into factors and sentiment, and then combining these to get an overall feeling.

Looking at the tweets, they all seem relevant in some way. Each one talks about Google-related terms like ""goog,"" ""target high targets,"" ""price targets,"" and mentions things like cybersecurity firms, options traders, and other tech companies. Since the target stock is clearly ""Google,"" I can focus on how each tweet affects Google's performance.

Starting with tweet 1: It mentions Google using glasses and that its URL was well, which might not directly impact the stock. The mention of $ goog makes me think it's a new investment, so maybe it's positive for someone looking to buy. 

Tweet 2 is a reaction to Google's new high target, which could indicate investor confidence and a possible positive sentiment if seen as favorable news.

Tweets 3 mentions price targets but doesn't directly talk about the stock's performance, just financial metrics. This might be neutral because it doesn't mention anything about the company's fundamentals or performance.

Tweet 4 talks about Google holding the NDX up and changing positions due to a cybersecurity firm acquisition, which is positive for investors in that sector.

Tweets 5 lists some stocks to watch this week, possibly focusing on tech companies like Apple, Starbuck's, Microsoft, etc. This could be neutral as it doesn't specifically mention the stock of interest.

Tweet 6 discusses Google being acquired by another firm and mentions VC funding, which might indicate positive news for investors who see it as a gain.

Tweets 7-12 are about other stocks that don't directly relate to Google, so their impact on the stock is likely [Neutral].

Now, considering all these factors—positive reactions from investors due to potential acquisition, increased targets by financial institutions—these seem to suggest overall positive sentiment. The tweets are focused on potential buy-ins or excitement in tech sectors.

I should also think about how each tweet's content and tone contributes to the overall sentiment. Positive mentions of new targets and potential gains often indicate optimism. While some tweets might mention other factors unrelated to Google, the majority seems to lean positively towards investors' expectations.

So putting it all together, the overall impact on Google's stock looks positive because there are a lot of positive reactions from various angles—acquisitions, target increases, and investor confidence."
2014-01-22,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets regarding their impact on the stock price of the given company.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: it mentions new alltimehighs in several stock tickers, which seems like a positive sign. The second tweet talks about Google's chairman denying knowledge of NSA snooping on firm data, which is generally seen as a major concern and can lead investors to sell shares. The third tweet refers to Google questioning the background of a man wearing Google glasses during a movie theater setting, which might not be directly related to stock prices but could affect investor sentiment indirectly. The fourth tweet states that Facebook is the next myspace, which seems irrelevant unless there's some indirect connection. The fifth tweet mentions adding Bitcoin support for Google's wallet and going to Reddit, again, no direct link to stock data.

Now, analyzing each relevant tweet:

1. **Positive**: The first tweet suggests new alltimehighs, so it's a strong positive factor.
2. **Negative**: The second tweet talks about knowledge of NSA snooping, which is serious. Google can impact investor sentiment negatively by causing shareholders to sell or reduce holdings.

The other tweets don't seem directly related, but the negative sentiment from the second tweet might weigh in on the overall picture. However, the first tweet's all-time high is a strong positive factor.

Putting it together, while one tweet shows a positive note, another shows significant negative, and others don't contribute much. But since we're only looking at relevant tweets that could impact stock prices, the second tweet is the most impactful. It directly mentions Google's chairman's actions, which can cause shareholders to sell their shares or reduce holdings. This negative sentiment from the chairman could lead to a selling pressure on the company's stock.

Therefore, even though the first tweet adds value, the dominant factor here is the negative sentiment in the second tweet."
2014-01-23,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of the company and assign them as [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Let's go through each tweet step by step.

Starting with the first tweet: AT_USER said that Google's design workaround around Pat offered still infringes on patents. There was a big battle won, but it's ongoing, so no end yet. That seems like some positive information about their product—maybe good news for investors who care about intellectual property. 

The second tweet mentions wishing for Apple to fix issues with Mavericks and mail &ical services hosted by Google. The user points out that these are broken, which could be a red flag if it affects their operations. If Apple is struggling, especially in areas like data storage or cloud services, this might lead investors to doubt their strategy.

Third tweet talks about Fed pulling Google's Glasso browser from the theater due to suspected piracy. This action could have implications for their global presence and user experience, which would be a concern for stock price if they're facing reputational issues.

Fourth tweet suggests trying contacts with Google. The user is probably looking to test or improve contact services, which might be seen as a move to expand into another space, possibly beneficial if this new business model resonates well.

Fifth tweet talks about a flood of new gadgets from Samsung and Sony entering the market. This would likely increase competition and could affect pricing, making investors concerned because higher competition can sometimes drive prices down unless they innovate more effectively.

Sixth tweet mentions rare earths prices dropping and short positions increasing for both Apple and Google. If rareearths are essential components for these companies, their stock performance is directly tied to this item's price, which could lead to negative sentiment if the price drops hurt their earnings or reputation.

Seventh tweet discusses revenue growth from Revo after 5 weeks with subscriber numbers up by 1,100%. This suggests they're increasing their user base and possibly expanding their market reach. If this aligns with their strategy for future stock performance, it might be a positive sign.

Eighth tweet introduces Gmail aimed at curbing email overload, affecting marketers relying on promotions. If Google is targeting specific groups that have high promotional costs, this could lead to lower margins or reduced revenue, which would be negative news.

Ninth tweet talks about analyzing $GDX, $GOOG, $UNT, etc., from a video recap. This seems like a technical analysis of the market, not directly impacting the stock performance unless it indicates broader market movement. It's probably neutral in this context.

Tenth tweet mentions Google acquisitions, which could affect their financials and hence investor sentiment if they're part of a larger growth strategy.

Eleventh tweet discusses $GOOG bugs in Chrome browser access to microphones. This technical issue might impact user experiences related to phone interactions or data capture tools, which could negatively affect app performance unless it's just an isolated problem not affecting overall sales.

Now, compiling these thoughts, the overall sentiment seems mixed. Some tweets suggest positive outcomes like new products, revenue growth, or innovation in services (like Gmail), while others highlight potential negatives from issues with existing operations, increased competition, or specific product impacts. The lack of clear direction across all tweets makes it difficult to pinpoint a dominant theme but leans towards uncertainty, suggesting neutral sentiment overall."
2014-01-24,Negative,"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to analyze the given tweets and determine their impact on the future stock price of a company. The options are Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

First, I'll go through each tweet one by one, identifying the target stock symbol and the factors mentioned in each.

1. **Tweet 1**: ""$ goog stock moving up slowly gmail will be alive soon $ $ $ :) ""
   - Identified as $goog.
   - The tweet mentions that Google's Gmail service is ""alive soon,"" which might indicate good news for investors, but it doesn't specify the direction of movement or any immediate impact.

2. **Tweet 2**: ""rt AT_USER google : ' we're investigating reports of an issue with gmail . we will provide more information shortly . ' $ goog""
   - Identified as $goog.
   - The tweet is a retweet and expresses that details about Google's Gmail are under investigation, which could be positive or neutral depending on the context. However, since it's just stating something to inform the user, it doesn't directly impact stock movements.

3. **Tweet 3**: ""$ goog [ video ] europe needs to decriminalize failure : schmidt URL""
   - Identified as $goog.
   - This tweet is unclear in its tone and mentions a potential legal issue. It's possible that there might be some public sentiment, but without more context on the impact of such a law, it's hard to assess definitively.

4. **Tweet 4**: ""rt AT_USER or $ yhoo :) rt AT_USER $ goog down .. doesn't that make $ aapl more valuable .""
   - Identified as $goog.
   - The tweet suggests that if Google goes down, another company (ApaL) might become more valuable. This could indicate a bearish view because it's implying that the current stock is undervalued when others are seen as overvalued.

5. **Tweet 5**: ""someone should tell $ twtr $ goog $ aapl $ aapl that markets correcting . these r the real teflon don't go it's a big correction 10 % >""
   - Identified as $goog.
   - The tweet mentions market corrections, which are typically bearish. A 10% correction is a significant drop, suggesting a negative impact on stock price.

6. **Tweet 6**: ""seeking alpha | google reportedly charging android oems for apps / services $ goog : URL""
   - Identified as $goog.
   - This tweet is speculative and not directly related to stock performance. It doesn't provide enough information about Google's current state, making it difficult to assess impact.

7. **Tweet 7**: ""give snowden credit for surveillance debate : google's schmidt URL $ goog snowden nsa security technology""
   - Identified as $goog.
   - This tweet is irrelevant and unrelated to the stock price of Google. The mention of Snowden and SNS (Security Services) might have implications, but without context on how that affects Google's stock, it's unclear.

8. **Tweet 8**: ""if this market selloff continues for another 5-10 % , there will be some great investing opportunities : $ aapl $ amzn $ goog $ tsla $ twtr $ yhoo""
   - Identified as $goog.
   - This tweet suggests that if Google's stock is underperforming, it could lead to better investment opportunities. It implies positive trends ahead, which might indicate a bullish sentiment.

9. **Tweet 9**: ""rt AT_USER more signs of shift from bricks to clicks in earnings call , with huge implications for $ goog $ amzn $ ebay $ aapl $ eat $ cmg $ dri $ …""
   - Identified as $goog.
   - This tweet talks about changes in earnings calls, which could indicate shifts in investor sentiment or expectations. It's possible that these trends might affect Google's performance but not directly stating it.

10. **Tweet 10**: ""rt AT_USER AT_USER i have used $ goog adwords for a few years for our business & do fairly well , although ... ( cont ) $ fb""
    - Identified as $goog.
    - This tweet is about using Google's AdWords and says they're doing well, but it doesn't mention any negative factors or market trends. It might indicate positive user engagement, which could be a good sign.

Now, compiling the analysis:

- **Positive Tweets**: Tweet 8 andTweet 10 suggest that if certain sectors like Apple (ApaL) and Amazon (Amzn) perform well, it could lead to good opportunities for Google. These tweets highlight potential positive trends ahead.
  
- **Neutral Tweets**: Tweets 2,3,5,7,9 provide information but are too vague or speculative. They don't give enough context about the factors influencing the stock.

- **Negative Tweets**: None of the provided tweets indicate negative sentiment or specific negative factors impacting Google's performance.

Considering the main positive points (Tweets 8 and 10), the overall sentiment seems to lean towards a positive outlook for Google, especially with potential opportunities from other companies. However, without more context from other tweets or broader market movements, it's difficult to say if there are significant downward trends yet."
2014-01-25,Neutral,"Alright, let me figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price. So, the user provided two tweets and asked for a conclusion on whether they'll increase, keep, or decrease the stock's value.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""rightsmile , inc . ( $ righ ): email from angel , march 10 . 2013 : URL $ righ $ phot $ stbv $ aegy $ mdbx $ goog $ fb $ mcig $ fitx"" The stock symbol here is rightsmile, inc., which I think might be rightsmile Inc. That seems familiar—it's part of the gaming industry.

The second tweet: ""hackers concoct most devious way yet to deliver android malware URL via AT_USER googleplay $ goog andriod malware"" This one mentions hackt, which probably stands for HackT, a company or individual known for hacking. It also talks about delivering Android malware through Google Play account. That sounds like something that could be malicious or indicative of security issues.

Now, considering each tweet separately. The first is from an angel investor, March 10th, 2013. Angel investors often make statements that are critical and can influence the stock negatively if they suggest bad news. However, without knowing the company's specific context, it's hard to say if this is positive or negative. It might be neutral if no significant events have happened.

The second tweet is from a hacker who is attempting to create malware through Google Play. This sounds concerning and suggests that there are security vulnerabilities in their target, which could hurt the stock price negatively. However, it's also possible they're trying to break something, so maybe it's not as straightforward as just negative news.

Putting both together: The first tweet adds critical information about rightsmile, but is it positive or neutral? Maybe a bit of info if it doesn't lead anywhere specific. The second tweet is more indicative of the target company having security issues and could be negative.

But wait, maybe the angel investor's statement is just a warning to investors, so it might not directly affect stock price much. If both tweets are pointing towards potential problems or vulnerabilities in rightsmile's operations, that could indicate a negative sentiment overall.

So combining both: The first tweet adds info but possibly neutral. The second is more negative. Overall sentiment would be Neutral because the information isn't definitive and the content suggests concerns about security."
2014-01-26,Neutral,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about the impact on a company's stock price.

First, I see two tweets. The first one says ""5 startups goog might acquire next URL via AT_USER."" That sounds like something speculative and probably not related to any specific company or their stock performance. It doesn't seem to directly mention the company in question, so maybe it's about potential investments or partnerships, which could influence investor sentiment.

The second tweet is ""24 of the world's biggest companies report earnings next week . including $ amzn , $ goog , $ fb , and $ aapl : URL."" This one mentions multiple big companies, specifically Apple (APL) and Amazon (AMZN), along with Facebook (FB). These are major tech and consumer goods companies. The tweet is providing information about upcoming earnings but doesn't specify the company whose stock price we're looking at.

Hmm, wait, both tweets don't mention a specific company's stock. That makes me think that maybe there's confusion in the data. The first tweet talks about startups acquiring URLs, which could be unrelated. The second one lists companies that might report earnings next week, but again, no specific target company is mentioned.

So if neither tweet mentions a specific stock or company, it's hard to assess the impact on their future stock price. Without knowing which company we're focusing on, I can't determine if its stock will go up, stay the same, or down. The tweets are just providing general information about companies that might be relevant, not directly affecting any particular stock.

I think in this case, since there's no specific target or company mentioned, it's neutral because we don't have enough context to make a decision. There's too little specificity to evaluate sentiment towards a particular stock."
2014-01-27,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a given company. The user provided 19 tweets and an example output. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. For example, in tweet 1, it's Ericsson, but looking at other tweets, it seems like the focus is on Google. So maybe I should look for tweets mentioning ""goog"" as that's the most common and likely to influence investor sentiment.

Next, for each relevant tweet, I'll separate positive and negative factors. For instance, in tweet 5, the user says they sold 25% of their $ goog position and bought it at 1.21, making a 9579% profit. That's definitely positive.

I should also assess the sentiment by evaluating whether the tweet adds value, takes risks, or makes assumptions without information. Each tweet that affects investor confidence will be part of my analysis.

Looking through all the tweets, I notice most are about Google-related news and stock buys/sells. The main ones are tweets 1 to 9, focusing on Google's products, earnings, and stock actions. Some mention other companies but not as dominant as Google.

I'll go through each tweet:

1. Ericsson paix avec samsung via brevets: Positive because Ericsson is a major player.
2. Nest ceo selling to Google: Neutral, just informing someone.
3. Google expanding same day deliveries: Positive.
4. paired trades using options for risk reduction: Neutral.
5. Significant profit from 25% sell: Definitely positive.
6. Earnings reports next week by big companies: Positive as it affects investor sentiment.
7. Budgenius (Google) meeting with someone, which is a bit vague but could be positive or negative. Not sure yet.
8. Google creating ethics board for AI tech: Neutral because it's about company culture without affecting stock price.
9. Google expanding delivery tests: Positive news.
10. Google buying AI startup for 400 million: This might influence investor sentiment positively if the purchase is strategic.

The rest of the tweets, like those mentioning other companies or less impactful points, don't seem to affect Google's position significantly.

Considering all the positive tweets and one strong sell tweet from tweet 10, I think there's some positive impact. But since not all are major news, it's a mix between positive and neutral."
2014-01-28,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided 12 tweets and wants me to assess each as either Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

First, let's start by looking at each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions that big tech firms reach an info sharing deal with the government and lists some URL stocks. This seems like a positive action from the company, potentially influencing investor sentiment positively.
2. The second tweet is about AT_USER possibly mainstreaming with VSP (which I think stands for something like VSI or VSP, maybe a specific stock) and asks if it will go mainstream. Without knowing what VSP does, it's hard to assess this one, but it might be neutral as the tweet seems speculative.
3. The third tweet is about a chart by AT_USER predicting that the market might become ""goo-lish,"" suggesting it could turn something ordinary into an interesting or unexpected topic. This sounds positive because it shows potential for change in investor sentiment.
4. The fourth tweet mentions the company's $ goog picking a team captain's words and asks if there are any last-minute words from their team. It seems like they're checking for trends or specific keywords, which might not have a significant impact on stock price but could be considered neutral because it's more of a follow-up question.
5. The fifth tweet talks about Google making a step ahead in AI. This is definitely positive because advancements in technology can boost company performance and attract investors, so this should be positive.
6. The sixth tweet asks what the user will say on $ yhoo about their $ goog numbers, referencing earlier thoughts from ""aapl."" It seems to seek information but doesn't give a clear indication of sentiment towards Google's stock price.
7. The seventh tweet mentions AT_USER mentioning Google getting prescription glasses with four styles priced at $225 each. This could be seen as positive because it might indicate improved image or technology, which is generally good for the company and investors.
8. The eighth tweet talks about VRNG (which I'm assuming stands for something like VSR or a specific index) having revenues growing by 4%, up to $20 or $50 per share. It mentions future stock price decisions from another trader versus Google. This looks positive because growth in revenues can boost investor confidence and stock value.
9. The ninth tweet says that Google's getglue becoming a TV tag focuses on curated TV moments, which might be about improving customer experience but not sure how it affects the company itself.
10. The tenth tweet is from Barron's regarding Yahoo's Q4 revenue of $1.2 billion and EPS of $0.46, beating expectations. This is positive because strong earnings can attract investors, so this should be positive.
11. The eleventh tweet mentions AT_USER reacting to Google paying a patent royalty rate of 6.5% after a halt by bloomberg. The specific number might influence investor sentiment positively if the company is expected to develop something new based on that rate.
12. The twelfth tweet tells AT_USER that Google will pay VRINGO a patent royalty rate of 6.5 percent, which is congruent with their previous message.

Now, summarizing each tweet's impact:

- Positive tweets: 1, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12.
- Neutral: 2, 4, 6.
- Negative: None of the given tweets are negative in content or sentiment analysis.

Therefore, overall sentiment is positive because there are multiple positive tweets that suggest improved business practices, revenue growth, strategic developments, and positive market sentiment."
2014-01-29,Negative,"Okay, I need to determine the overall impact on the stock price based on the given tweets. Let's go through each tweet step by step.

1. **rt AT_USER google selling motorola phone business but keeping some patents URL via AT_USER $ goog**
   - The user is selling their motorola business but keeping patents. This shows they're selling assets and not just trying to keep profits, which could indicate cautious sentiment.
   
2. **lenovo to acquire motorola from google for $ 2.91 bilion $ goog**
   - Lenovo buying Motorola isn't the best idea as it risks revenue loss. Investors probably aren't sure about this deal.
   
3. **AT_USER bought AT_USER for $ 12.5 b in 2012 , sold for $ 2.9 b today ... that's what i call scrap value . never bet against the iphone . $ goog**

7. **rt AT_USER prescription lenses are coming soon to google glass . how it could impact the eye-care industry : URL $ goog**

9. **nikkei , china , aus look bad for thurs , eu prob react to fed news dropping , like $ dow did $ oil hinting up , $ goog & $ aapl maybe simphathy up**
   - Economic reports from multiple regions could impact the stock prices negatively if they affect the economy.
   
10. **wyoming among states eyeing laws to ban google glass while driving $ goog URL via AT_USER**
    - State laws affecting Google's products might be seen by investors, but it seems related to a business move rather than a direct financial decision.
    
11. **very nice moves today on some stocks . looking at bullish setups for tomorrow's open $ gtat $ ezpw $ rcon $ spy $ goog $ cdti $ x $ hubg $ tsra**
    - The user is highlighting positive moves with bullish setups, which suggests optimism and cautious optimism.

14. **rt AT_USER breaking : lenovo nears $ 3b deal to buy google's handset unit , sources tell reuters . URL • $ goog**
    - Another acquisition, which is positive for the company, possibly boosting stock price.
    
15. **$ goog - will flash memory spell the end of the hard disk drive ( hdd ) industry ? -> URL stock stocks stockaction**
    - The tweet suggests that an upcoming tech event might impact HDDs negatively, which could reduce demand and thus affect stock prices.
    
16. **if $ goog increases $ himx stake we will see $ 20s fast imo . they bot initial 6.3 % stake right before googleglass beta launch . $ qcom $ aapl $ fb**
    - This indicates that the user is predicting the impact of a new beta version on their existing stake, which might lead to stock moves.
    
17. **stock trading isnt an occupation its a school of thoughts ... see you at the top $ fb $ twtr $ lnkd $ goog $ aapl**
    - The tweet suggests that trading stocks isn't a formal position but is rather a thought process, implying uncertainty about the future.

Considering all these tweets, there's both positive and negative sentiment. Some are cautious (tweets 1-3), others expect gains (tweets 4-6, 8-10), some worry about economic impacts (tweets 9-12), and some point to possible stock movements due to market reactions (tweets 11,14). The overall tone is a mix of cautious optimism, anticipation of new deals, uncertainty from economic data, and potential future moves in the tech sector."
2014-01-30,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the overall sentiment of these tweets related to a company called ""lenovo."" Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol. Looking through the tweets, one of them mentions lenovo and something about motorola. The URL is $lnvgy$, so the stock symbol is ""lenovo"". Got that.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one to analyze their factors and sentiment towards lenovo. 

1. The first tweet talks about lenovo swallowing motorola and mentions Google and IBM. It seems like it's adding lenovo as a competitor, but not the seller.
2. The second tweet says that Google confirmed an acquisition of Lenovo's mobility from Google. This is positive because it's expanding their operations.
3. The third tweet discusses a sale where Lenovo sold motorola home to Amazon for $2.35B. It mentions more than just that, so again, this is positive about expansion.
4. The fourth tweet talks about Qcom and Apple, but the user is confused about mobile slowdowns affecting smartphone sales in Europe. Not sure if this is positive or negative.
5. The fifth tweet mentions how many people bought Google's Glass in the last quarter, suggesting customer interest. Positive towards stock growth.
6. The sixth tweet states that Google up 2% after reporting lenovo and motorola reports. This is definitely positive for the company.
7. The seventh tweet lists additional earnings reports for Amazon, AMC, Amzn, CRCM, Wynn, and N. This could indicate improved financial health, which might be a positive sign for customers or investors.
8. The eighth tweet mentions lenovo buying motorola from Amzn. Since it's a merger, this is another acquisition, so positive sentiment.
9. The ninth tweet talks about Facebook's performance and correlation with Google stocks. While some might find Facebook undervalued, the general sentiment could be positive as it's a tech company.
10. The tenth tweet says Google continues to outperform, even if they're spying. This seems positive because it shows resilience despite external factors.
11. The eleventh tweet details a Google news story about selling motorola to Lenovo for $2.91B. It mentions the sale and what Google will do next.
12. The twelfth tweet talks about volatility, especially after earnings, which could indicate investor concern or fear.
13. The thirteenth tweet discusses Magic's bounce, suggesting a positive trend from earnings.
14. The fourteenth tweet is just a placeholder or typo, so no information here.
15. The fifteenth tweet details Lenovo acquiring motorola for $2.91B and Google keeping patents. Positive acquisition.
16. The sixteenth tweet confirms that Google sold motorola mobility. This is positive expansion.
17. The seventeenth tweet mentions getting rid of sweaters as a way to sell Lenovo, which could indicate a strategic move to reduce inventory or focus on new markets.
18. The eighteenth tweet talks about emerging markets and $ goog selling handsets business. Positive for global growth.
19. The nineteenth tweet discusses market shares from competitors like Facebook and others. This suggests competition from other tech giants, which could be negative if it dilutes profit margins.
20. The twentieth tweet provides stock performance percentages for Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple. Positive as they are all increasing, showing gains.
21. The twenty-first tweet mentions a nice line about covering $ goog and another placeholder or typo.
22. The twenty-second tweet says Google missed by $0.28 but beat revenue. Positive because it's good financial performance.
23. The twenty-third tweet discusses expectations of higher stock splits and dividends, which are positive signals for investors.
24. The twenty-fourth tweet talks about auctioning government bonds to the Treasury Department. This is a serious move that could impact profitability, possibly negative for customers or investors.
25. The twenty-fifth tweet mentions Google selling its motorola mobility unit. Positive acquisition again.
26. The twenty-sixth tweet notes that Google's sale didn't involve Amzn but rather a different company. So it might not be part of the same deal as in the previous tweet, so maybe just another acquisition.
27. The twenty-seventh tweet is about Google's sales performance in 2015. Positive for the stock growth.

Now, considering all these points: multiple acquisitions with positive outcomes (like selling motorola and other companies), earnings, expansion into new markets, increased revenue, improved financial metrics, strategic decisions to reduce inventory or focus on new areas. 

There are some negative points like market share concerns from competitors but mostly, it's more about the company expanding its product line or entering new markets rather than facing internal criticism.

So overall sentiment is positive because of the expansion, higher revenue, strategic moves, and improved financial health."
2014-01-31,Negative,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of Google. Let me go through each tweet one by one and analyze them step by step.

First, the target stock is Google (GOOGL). 

1. The first tweet says ""Stop down 9 points. Tiny meaningless loss. That's what happens when get bored and push a trade. Oh well."" This seems to indicate a bearish sentiment because of the loss, but it's too vague and not very specific.

2. The second tweet mentions the VIX methodology for Google, comparing its price to a 50-day moving average (MA) and mentions an increase by $3.5%. While this could influence investor behavior, I don't have enough information about what exactly they're talking about in their methodology.

3. The third tweet is just a link request, ""new to options trading watch how to buy put options today URL."" Not much here, probably not affecting the stock price negatively or positively.

4. The fourth tweet states that Google stopped down 9 points, saying it's because of boredom and pushing trades. This seems like a negative sentiment based on past experiences but is too vague.

5. The fifth tweet reports earnings: $12.01 EPS and $13.55 revenue. Positive info, which could indicate potential for an upward movement if earnings are strong.

6. The sixth tweet criticizes institutions driving tech trends, implying a cautious market environment. This can be seen as bearish because people might worry about regulation or company decisions.

7. The seventh tweet discusses a 420 patent lawsuit between Google and the USPTO. If this is a major event, it could impact Google's revenue or stock price negatively if they face lawsuits.

8. The eighth tweet talks about Google rallying on VIX methodology. Again, without knowing what that means in terms of sentiment, it's hard to assess.

9. The ninth tweet reviews earnings and revenue for Q4: $12.01 vs. a target of $12.24, missing EPS by $0.23, and revenue of $13.60B. Positive info about future performance could suggest potential gains but might not directly affect the current stock price.

10. The tenth tweet mentions Google leading tech retreats and rallies in tech stocks like YHOO and ZYNGA. This suggests that investors are watching out for these companies, which could be a positive sign for Google's overall market sentiment.

11. The eleventh tweet is about Q4 performance: EPS $12.01 vs. estimates of $12.24, revenue of $13.60B. Positive info on financials, but I need to check if this is a standalone event or part of a larger trend.

12. The twelfth tweet talks about VIX methodology for Google and the 50-day MA. Similar to tweet 7, it's a methodological report but without context, it's hard to gauge sentiment.

13. The thirteenth tweet mentions Google stock moving up after streamers like CSIQ, UCO, PAAS, and SS URL. Positive movement in a sector could indicate broader market strength.

14. The fourteenth tweet is about Google raising its price to $1,200. This seems like a short-term move but not specific enough for sentiment analysis.

15. The fifteenth tweet discusses stock movers on the pre-open market: ZNGA, CMGR, GOOG higher; DILLR, AMZN, MA lower. This could indicate that Google is on an upward trend relative to others, signaling potential for a rise in stock price.

16. The sixteenth tweet reports Google's price hitting $1,200. Without context, it's speculative and hard to assess impact.

17. The seventeenth tweet asks about a defined risk transparency check with USY and GOOG. This is a factual question rather than an opinion, so less likely to influence sentiment positively or negatively.

18. The eighteenth tweet mentions a pre市场 meeting, focusing on various stocks including Tesla (TSLA), Facebook (FA) etc. This could imply broader market activity but not specific to Google's price movement.

19. The nineteenth tweet talks about Q4 beating expectations by 13 points with $16.86B revenue and missing EPS of $12.01 due to Motorola. Positive financial results could lead to gains, though again, without context it's unclear.

20. The twentieth tweet says Google is among the top 50 hot stocks on the market. This is about current trends rather than stock performance.

21. The twenty-first tweet mentions no stock split for Google but pays a quarterly dividend. While dividends are important, they don't directly affect the stock price unless it's seen as a sign of financial strength.

22. The twenty-second tweet warns that Google might face regulatory scrutiny if their stock price goes too high. This is a potential negative factor affecting sentiment.

Now, considering all these tweets together: There's some positive information about earnings, market movements in related companies, and potential future performance expectations. However, many of the tweets are speculative or based on methodological studies without specific context. The overall sentiment seems mixed with some bearish elements like stock movers, regulatory concerns, and limited data on actual performance.

I think the best way to conclude is that while there are positive signs from earnings and related movements, the broader market environment includes factors like patent cases, regulatory scrutiny, and cautious behavior due to institutions, all of which contribute to a mixed sentiment. Therefore, I'll lean towards a neutral conclusion."
2014-02-01,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on Google's stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Hmm, looking at them:

1. The first one mentions ""goog"" and ""$ goog $ googl"". It looks like it's about Google's stock since they mention ""goog"" in lowercase but with a capital G elsewhere.
2. The second tweet is just a company name without any stock symbol.
3. The third tweet refers to the stock as ""$ goog"", which again is clearly related to Google.
4. The fourth tweet says, ""google reports higher profit , bolstered by an increase in advertising revenue . $ goog URL""
5. The fifth tweet: ""why google has more growth ahead URL""

Okay, so the target stock seems to be ""goog"" or ""GOOGLE"". Since they're using lowercase letters but it's followed by a dollar sign and similar words for Google.

Now, let's process each tweet one by one.

1. rt AT_USER what google's stock split means for investors : $ goog $ googl
   - The user is asking about a stock split. Stock splits usually increase the number of shares without changing the total value, so it might not affect the price significantly but could provide more visibility or support to shareholders.
   
2. Google inc . sets record highs after hours $ goog URL
   - This seems to be a question about whether Google has set new record highs. It's checking if their stock is up. I'm not sure if setting records in that timeframe affects the price; it might just indicate strong performance, but overall, it could be considered supportive.

3. $ goog - wall street tumbles in worst january since 10 -> URL stock stocks stockaction
   - This tweet seems to suggest that Wall Street is doing badly because Google's stock is down and there are actions like ""stockaction"" which isn't a familiar term but might imply something about their stock.
   
4. rt AT_USER google reports higher profit , bolstered by an increase in advertising revenue . $ goog URL
   - The user is reporting positive news—Google made profits and had more revenue from advertising. This would likely indicate good earnings, which can boost investor confidence.

5. $ goog why google has more growth ahead URL
   - Again, similar structure to tweet 4 but phrased differently. It's indicating that Google expects growth, which is a positive sign.

Now, putting it all together:

- Tweet 1: A question about stock split. Not a strong statement on price.
- Tweet 2: Checking for record highs—it could indicate good performance but not necessarily a big increase in price.
- Tweet 3: Suggesting a bad Januari for Wall Street, which might not directly affect Google's stock.
- Tweets 4 and 5 both are positive news about earnings and growth. Positive statements tend to have a positive impact on stock prices.

But wait, is tweet 1 a stock split? If it's a small stock split, maybe it's considered neutral because it doesn't change the price much. On the other hand, if it's a significant split or a buyout, that might be more impactful.

However, since the user didn't specify the exact terms for stock splits or the size of the increase, I should consider it as possibly moderate. So, combining all these, positive tweets 4 and 5 give strong signals about earnings and growth, which are generally good indicators of future performance.

But tweet 3 is a bit ambiguous because ""wall street tumbles in worst january since 10""—it could be a typo or misunderstanding in the word ""worst"". Maybe it means a prolonged bad January without specific context on what's worse. If that's a negative event for Wall Street, it might indirectly suggest investor sentiment going down, but Google's stock is still expected to rebound with positive earnings.

Additionally, tweet 1 could be seen as a bit vague because it just mentions the question without providing specifics about the split amount or effect. A well-crafted stock split would likely boost confidence, but without clear data on what happened, it might not be significantly negative.

Overall, considering all factors—positive earnings reports, positive statements from Wall Street (even if ambiguous), and Google's overall health in its recent performance—the sentiment seems favorable for the stock."
2014-02-02,Neutral,"Alright, so I'm trying to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me start by understanding what each tweet is saying and how it might affect the stock.

First, I'll look at the target stock symbol mentioned in all the tweets: APL. So, we're focusing on that particular stock. 

The first tweet says: ""rt AT_USER triple digit returns from daytrades killer webinar URL $ aapl $ goog"". The word 'trader' and 'webinar' suggest an event or discussion related to trading strategies, maybe something about returning investments. The mention of APL andgoog being positive indicators could be good for the stock.

The second tweet: ""rt AT_USER rt AT_USER open interest – february 7th expiration $ aapl $ amzn $ cmg $ fb $ goog $ nflx $ pcln $ tsla URL"". This seems like it's talking about open interest, which is usually related to trading volume. A higher open interest could mean more buying or selling activity, but since it's specifically about February 7th expiration and includes multiple companies, it might indicate a broader market effect rather than just the target stock.

The third tweet: ""pull the trigger for triple digit returns on same day amazing webinar URL $ aapl $ goog"". This is similar to the first tweet. It seems like a positive event leading to increased trading activity, again pointing towards APL andgoog being good news.

The fourth tweet: ""why google is the top tech play of our generation URL $ goog $ aapl $ twtr google AT_USER $ tsla $ ddd technology tech $ fb"". Here, it's discussing Google's dominance in the tech industry among older generations. This could imply that Google is doing well in the market and that tech stocks are undervalued.

Now, combining all these thoughts: The first tweet mentions a webinar related to trading strategies, which might suggest increased activity. The third tweet repeats the idea of similar events leading to more returns. The fourth tweet suggests Google's position as a top tech player, which could boost other tech stocks. However, there are conflicting mentions like Feb 7 expiration in the second tweet, but I'm not sure how that directly affects APL.

Overall, the main positive factors seem to be the webinar events and the focus on Google. But some tweets about market conditions or broader tech trends might have mixed feelings. It's a bit of a mix, so the overall sentiment is leaning towards a balance, making it [Neutral]."
2014-02-03,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. The user provided 10 tweets and asked me to analyze them for possible positive, neutral, or negative effects.

First, let's break down the steps they mentioned: identifying the target stock from the tweets, analyzing each tweet in terms of factors (positive/negative), assessing sentiment, and then summarizing the overall impact. The stocks involved here are APEL, GOOG, TSLA, and股可能是指股票，我猜是股票AB.

Looking at the tweets:

1. ""trades produce 100 % same day webinar on wednesday URL $ aapl $ goog"" - This seems like positive because it's talking about a webinar. A positive keyword is present.
2. ""account doubling system free webinar URL $ goog $ tsla"" - Again, positive with the mention of a webinar.
3. ""rt AT_USER multi-baggers daily watch video URL $ tsla $ goog"" - Positive, focusing on content and a webinar.
4. ""youtube zaplatil v posledních letech přes miliardu dolarů hudebnímu průmyslu , přiznává tom pickett , vicepresident of youtube content $ goog"" - This is positive because it's talking about a webinar attended by someone else, probably increasing interest in GOOG.
5. ""rt AT_USER account doubling system webinar on wednesday URL $ aapl $ goog"" - Positive again with the webinar mentioned.
6. ""rt AT_USER catch reversals accurately killer webinar URL $ tsla $ goog"" - Positive, referencing a webinar for investors interested in TSLA.
7. ""laser targeted signals make 100 % returns in minutes webinar this wed URL $ aapl $ goog"" - Positive about returns from a webinar.
8. ""big bang profits with options must attend webinar URL $ goog $ tsla"" - Positive, again referencing the company for a webinar.
9. ""$ goog get ready for tons of new chromecast apps : google releases cast sdk URL"" - This seems positive because Google is releasing something important.
10. ""rt AT_USER apple joins google on fda med tech regulators ' meeting calendar-URL $ aapl $ goog by AT_USER"" - Positive, apple attending a regulatory meeting with Google.

All 10 tweets are either positive about webinars or involve Google products and announcements. They all seem to be promoting the company's stock or related events. There's no negative mention of issues affecting the company, so the overall sentiment is likely positive."
2014-02-04,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on Tesla's stock price. 

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. The stock symbols mentioned are TSLA (Tesla), GOOGL (Google), and APLX (Apple). Looking at each tweet:

1. ""rt AT_USER explosive returns daily check out trade URL $ tsla $ goog"" – This seems like it's related to Tesla, so I'll focus on that.
2. ""rt AT_USER average 50 % on every daytrade free webinar URL $ tsla $ goog"" – Again, seems about Tesla.
3. ""rt AT_USER everything you need in morning links : buffett , bezos , brin did quite well last year URL $ goog URL"" – This could be related to Google or Apple, but given the context around stock prices, it might not be as relevant for Tesla's impact on TSLA.
4. ""rt AT_USER google awards $ 106m in stock , cash to chairman eric schmidt URL $ goog"" – Talks about Google stock and a chairman award, which could affect investors' perceptions of the company, possibly Google, but not specifically Tesla.
5. ""average 50 % on every daytrade 40 % returns in minutes video URL $ aapl $ goog"" – This is about Apple, so again, might be unrelated to Tesla's stock unless there are indirect effects.
6. ""rt AT_USER google approves $ 100 million in restricted stock units , $ 6 million in cash bonus for eric schmidt - filing • $ goog"" – Consistent with the previous tweets, discussing Google stock and chairman Eric Schmidt's performance, which could influence investor sentiment towards Google but may not directly impact Tesla unless there are synergies.
7. ""so when does $ goog buy $ yelp ? google reviews ... sounds nice"" – This seems to be a tweet about Google reviews or reviews on YELP, which might not have a direct effect on Tesla's stock price.

Now, for each relevant tweet (1-6):

1. ""explosive returns"": Positive, suggesting good performance could boost the stock.
2. ""average 50% returns"": Average positive sentiment, but maybe neutral since it's a general statement without specifics.
3. ""nothing directly related to Tesla or Google"": Maybe irrelevant for Tesla's stock impact.
4. "" Google stock and chairman award"": If there's a relationship with another company like Apple, but unless the tweet implies that Google stock affects Tesla's price, which is unlikely, this might be neutral.
5. ""Apple stock performance"": No direct link to Tesla's stock price unless it affects broader market sentiment on a related topic, which isn't clear here.
6. ""Google stock approving bonuses"": Again, unrelated to Tesla without implying any connection.

Considering the analysis, only tweets 1 and 2 are directly about Tesla. The rest don't mention Tesla or affect it significantly. However, tweet 3 might imply that something good happened for other companies related to Google, which could indirectly affect Google's stock, but there's no evidence of a direct link from this tweet to Tesla's stock price.

Overall, the tweets suggest positive trends in tech companies (Google and Apple), which can sometimes lead to market confidence. However, without clear information linking these tweets to Tesla's specific stock performance or any relevant news about it, it's hard to determine if they have a significant impact on TSLA's future stock price."
2014-02-05,Positive,"Okay, let's analyze the tweets to determine their likely impact on the future stock price of a company. The given tweets seem to be from users discussing various topics related to Google and other tech companies. 

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol mentioned in each tweet. It looks like some tweets mention $ twtr, $ goog, $ tsla, $ fb, and others. However, without knowing which specific company's stock is being referred to, it might be challenging. But given the context, I can assume that $ goog and related companies are involved since many tweets mention Google-related terms.

Next, each tweet needs to be analyzed for positive (P), negative (N), or neutral (U) factors. The user is expressing concerns about Google's performance in various areas like stock probe settlements, revenue growth through webinars, social media interactions, privacy issues, and even trade entries using options. 

Each tweet seems to express uncertainty or potential positive outlooks regarding Google's future performance. For example, tweets 5 and 6 mention triple-digit returns and revenue push from webinars. These could indicate optimism about the company's growth prospects.

However, some tweets are critical or negative, like mentioning privacy issues or social media interactions that might affect investor sentiment negatively. But overall, the positive factors seem to be more prominent in these tweets.

Considering all the points, the positive factors show increased confidence and potential growth in areas important to investors. The critical aspects mention things like privacy and webinars but don't outweigh the positive trends. Therefore, combining these, the overall sentiment appears to be positive."
2014-02-06,Positive,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, the target stock is ""Goog Inc."" which is the name of Google. So that's my base for everything else.

Looking at the first tweet: ""AT_USER why not 15,000 ? bernstein ups $ goog pt to $ 1,500 URL"". This seems like a direct offer for shares. It says ""up"" and gives the price, so I think this is a positive signal for investors because they're willing to pay more. That's definitely going to have a positive impact on the stock.

Next tweet: ""strategies for options traders must attend webinar URL $ goog $ tsla"". This mentions Google and TSLA (tesla). It says $ goog $ tsla, which I think means Google is involved in a stock or product related to Tesla. But without specific information on what the webinar covers, it's hard to tell if this is positive or negative. It could be neutral because while Google might have something relevant, it's speculative.

Third tweet: "" $ goog android search update lets you pick video on-demand providers in google now URL"". This is another offer, but instead of a price increase, it seems like Google is updating their services with Android and video searches. More user engagement can generally be positive because it can expand the company's reach and customer satisfaction.

Fourth tweet: "" $ goog google inc ( goog ) news : is google losing its mojo to facebook , twitter and ... URL"". This seems negative because it says Google is losing its mojo to Facebook, Twitter, etc. If a company loses a major competitor or partner, it can hurt their performance. So this is definitely a negative factor.

Fifth tweet: ""$ goog - google unveils box for business videoconferences -> URL stock stocks stockaction"". This looks like a press release or announcement about Google introducing a new feature related to business conferences. New features can sometimes boost productivity and growth, but it's not clear if Google is actually doing that. It could be positive because more meetings might increase sales, but the wording isn't very specific.

Sixth tweet: ""$ rcon - great upside potential with 52 - wk high in target at $ 5.80 - china natural gas play stockaction $ fb $ goog $ twtr $ lnkd $ msft"". This mentions RCON (which I think is an acronym for something, maybe a company or index), China's natural gas plays, and multiple other stocks. It seems like Google has a significant investment position in natural gas, which can affect energy prices. If the price of natural gas goes up, companies that rely on it might benefit. So this is a positive factor because of potential gains from this industry.

Now, let me summarize the factors:

Positive tweets: 1 and 3
Negative tweets: 4
Neutral: Not sure about 2 and 5

So overall, we have some positive signals (two offers) but one negative tweet. The neutral ones are ambiguous. Since there's a clear positive from Google introducing Android services, which is a common trend for tech companies to expand their product line.

Considering all the factors, while there's an ambiguity in the second and fifth tweets, they seem less impactful than the two direct offers. Therefore, I think the overall sentiment is positive."
2014-02-07,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me start by looking at each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet talks about daytraders aiming for a webinar on Wednesday. That's more about trading strategies than stocks, so probably not affecting the stock directly.
2. The second tweet is from Facebook and mentions phantom revenue leading to seeking alpha. Seeking alpha can sometimes boost performance but it doesn't necessarily mean good stock performance.
3. The third tweet introduces an app for finding hot iPhones, which could be a positive signal about tech trends, possibly leading some investors to buy stocks related to tech companies.
4. This tweet seems like a sales pitch promoting buying shares of both Google and Apple. It's a call to action that might attract more investors, especially through social media platforms.
5. Another attempt by Facebook to sell shares on the exchange, which could push prices up but also attracts competition.
6. A tweet from Tesla showing high returns in minutes compared to a stock's performance elsewhere. This seems like a positive sign for Tesla, possibly pushing its stock price up.
7. A comment about 100 swipes taking time to find an iPhone app, suggesting that there might be some interest or buzz around tech companies, which could translate into buying more shares.
8. Similar to tweet 4, Facebook is promoting the webinar on both companies, which would likely draw in more investors and increase interest in Google.
9. Google announced a purchase of a 5.94% stake in Lenovo, which is a tech company. This strategic acquisition could have long-term effects on their stock price, potentially boosting it.
10. Facebook claiming to be leading the U.S. most valuable stock index, which would make sense if they're doing well and attracting more capital, which can increase their stock value.
11. A list of companies with app updates for iPhones and Androids, indicating a buzz around tech trends that might drive investor interest in related stocks.
12. Same as tweet 6, Tesla's returns compared to another company, suggesting positive news about them.
13. Another repeat of the same content from tweet 6, so this is redundant but still supports Tesla's performance.
14. A call to action for users to watch a series via their social media account, promoting Google and Apple stocks.
15. Another attempt by Facebook to attend a webinar on Google and Apple stock trading. While it's not exactly about the company itself, it might attract some investors.
16. A tweet from Tesla again, emphasizing its success in the weekend.
17. A call to action for users to watch a series on Amazon, NVIDIA, and Google, promoting multiple tech companies.
18. Google entering an antitrust deal with the EU, which is a regulatory move that could affect their market position if they face competition or new regulations.

Looking at all these tweets, I notice several points: some are promotional (like selling shares), others are suggesting acquisitions or partnerships. There's also mention of Tesla's performance, which can be positive for tech stocks. Google has made strategic moves like acquisitions and regulatory updates that could have long-term benefits. These factors suggest a general positive sentiment about the company, possibly increasing investor interest and stock prices."
2014-02-08,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for a given company. The user has provided nine tweets, and each seems to be related to stock prices with mentions of Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), or other companies.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking through each tweet, it seems they are all about AAPL or GOOG. Let me focus on each one individually.

1. The first tweet says ""rt AT_USER average 50 % on every day trade killer webinar URL $ aapl $ goog."" So the focus is on both Apple and Google. That's good because if multiple stocks are mentioned, it could indicate broader market sentiment.

2. The second tweet mentions ""supercharged options trade must attend webinar URL $ goog $ tsla."" Here, only Google is mentioned, along with Tesla (TSLA). This suggests a specific focus on Google.

3. The third tweet says ""trades produce 100 % same day check out trade URL $ aapl $ goog."" Again, both Apple and Google are discussed here.

4. The fourth tweet talks about ""daytraders dream trades must attend webinar URL $ goog $ tsla."" Similar to the second one, only Google is mentioned, but focused on TSLA.

5. The fifth tweet discusses "" $ goog - [ video ] blockchain banned by apple -> URL stock stocks stockaction."" This seems like a negative statement about Apple's decision regarding blockchain.

6. The sixth tweet says ""$ goog at 19x2014 est operating profit . at same multiple $ aapl = $ 1,245 per share . ridiculous . keep buying tim ! you still have…"" Here, it mentions Google's earnings and talks about investing in Tim Cook, who is an Apple employee. This could be positive if the user thinks that Tim has personal interest or views on Apple.

7. The seventh tweet says ""$ goog no , carl icahn : apple inc . shouldn't trade at google inc . multiples : no , carl icahn : apple inc . shouldn't trade at google inc . URL."" Here, there are quotes from Carl Icahn, a big figure in tech. It's critical and negative, implying that Apple should avoid trading with Google.

8. The eighth tweet has more text: ""$ goog no , carl icahn : apple inc . shouldn't trade at google inc . multiples : no , carl icahn : apple inc . shouldn't trade at google inc . URL."" Again, similar to the seventh one, focusing on Icahn's comments.

9. The ninth tweet is again about $ goog and Apple. It doesn't add much beyond what was seen in previous tweets.

Now, breaking it down:

- The overall sentiment seems negative because of tweets 5, 7, 8, 9 which are critical about Apple's actions regarding Google (like blockchain banned) and specific quotes from Icahn.
- The fifth tweet is a direct criticism of Apple's decision to ban blockchain on their stock. This could be seen as negative for the user if they're trying to buy shares or have positive views about AI/Blockchain.

Considering all these tweets, especially the ones by Carl Icahn and the critical statements about Apple's move towards Google stocks, it leans heavily towards a Negative sentiment."
2014-02-09,Neutral,"Alright, so I need to analyze the given tweets to determine their likely impact on the future stock price of a company. The user provided 12 tweets and has already outlined the process they should follow: identifying the target stock symbol, analyzing each tweet into positive and negative factors, assessing sentiment, and then summarizing the overall sentiment.

First, let's break down each tweet one by one to see if I can figure out what's going on. The target stock seems to be Google since there are several mentions of ""goog."" Let me go through them step by step.

1. **$ goog - acer c720 review**: This tweet is about the Chromebook and waiting for the mass market. Not directly related to stocks, so probably not affecting the overall sentiment.

2. **expose on a penny stock criminal for the ages URL help me spread it $ fb $ twtr $ lnkd $ goog $ yhoo peeps !**: This looks like clickbait or promotional content. While promoting something, it might not be serious enough to influence investor sentiment significantly. Maybe a bit positive but maybe not enough.

3. **rt AT_USER trades produce 100 % same day sign up for free 1 week alerts URL $ aapl $ goog**: This seems like another clickbait tactic with promises of massive discounts or benefits. It might be more about generating excitement than making a decision, so it's probably positive but maybe not enough.

4. **android instability URL $ goog google $ ssnlf $ aapl**: Similar to tweet 2 and 3, this is promoting something without providing concrete information. Maybe a bit of sell, but not significant enough for overall sentiment.

5. **rt AT_USER google spent $ 7.3 billion on its data centers in 2013 : more than doubles 2012 spending . URL $ goog**: This tweet is serious and mentions a significant investment. It's making an announcement about something, which could be positive because it shows that the company is committed to growth or innovation. But I need to consider if it's generating excitement for investors.

6. **get great research on stocks $ cvti $ sn $ iff $ goog i suggest URL**: Promotional content again, trying to sell stock research services. It might be more about encouraging readers to engage with the material than making a decision themselves. Maybe just a bit of positive influence.

7. **$ goog flappy bird creator says popular game will fly no more URL**: Another clickbait tweet claiming that a popular game is ending, which could mean it's being removed from the market or removed from developers' lists. This might be a negative signal because it removes a potential investment opportunity, but I'm not sure how strong this impact would be.

8. **rt AT_USER trades produce 100 % same day try free for 1 week URL $ aapl $ goog**: Similar to tweets 4 and 7, this is promoting something without giving concrete information. It's likely more about excitement than making a decision.

9. **high performance daytrading get free 1 week alerts URL $ aapl $ goog**: Another promotion, encouraging people to trade but not necessarily providing specific stock info. Maybe positive because it draws in others, but I'm not sure how impactful this is on the company's stock price.

10. **$ goog google , twitter , facebook and microsoft play nice in the internet safe ... URL**: This seems like a vague statement about companies in the internet space playing well together. It might be positive if they are seen as strong players, but without specifics, it's hard to tell how this affects individual stocks.

11. **rt AT_USER extreme daytrades 100 % in a day webinar on wednesday URL $ goog $ tsla**: Another promotion with high hopes for trading and a specific event mentioned. It could be very positive because it's generating excitement about the stock, but again, without specifics, I'm not certain.

12. **$ goog is reportedly putting considerable brain power into smartwatch URL u thot $ aapl would get a free pass , did u ?**: This seems like an unrelated tweet, possibly trying to sell a service or something else. It might be more promotional than serious, so maybe only a slight positive impact.

Now, considering all these tweets, the main ones that stand out are 5 and 10 because they have specific information about Google's investments or achievements. Tweet 5 mentions a significant investment, which could indicate confidence in their future performance. Tweet 10 talks about others playing well in the internet space, which might suggest positive trends but not necessarily related to Google's stock.

I need to evaluate if these tweets provide enough clarity for investors. For tweet 5, the fact that Google spent $7.3 billion is a concrete number and could show a long-term commitment or expansion, which might be seen as positive. Tweet 10 mentions others in the internet space playing well, but it doesn't directly relate to Google's performance unless there's an overlap.

However, these are just minor points compared to the broader context of the stock market. The overall sentiment seems mixed because while some tweets have positive elements like investments or success stories, others are more promotional without specific information. Therefore, I'm leaning towards a neutral or slightly positive sentiment overall, but not sure if it's enough to be positive.

Wait, tweet 5 is about Google spending money, which could be seen as confident and forward-thinking, while the other tweets are more about trends and promotions. So maybe there's an element of uncertainty because Google hasn't always followed these patterns. But without more context from other tweets, I can't say for sure if it's positive or not.

In conclusion, based on the information given, some tweets show positive signals like investments, while others are more speculative. The overall sentiment seems to be a mix of positive and negative influences, making it neutral."
2014-02-10,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company based on their provided analysis. The user has already given me some tweets and an example output, so maybe they want me to apply the same process step by step.

First, let's look at each tweet one by one and see what information I can extract. From the tweets, it seems like the target stock is related to Google, possibly because several of them mention Google or its related companies like Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, Amazon, or others.

Starting with tweet 1: It mentions YHOO (which is Alphabet Inc., often abbreviated as YHOO) and talks about the company's performance. Positive factors here are that YHOO's stock was at $100 pre-market, and there were comments from Marissa Mayer, which might imply some positive sentiment towards Google. However, it doesn't mention negative factors.

Tweet 2 is about HON (Hydroxy Group) forecasts a net loss in the first quarter. This sounds like a negative factor for the stock because a loss could affect investor confidence and therefore their decisions.

Tweet 3 discusses ARL's earnings, specifically mentioning an estimate of $19x2014 with a multiple compared to Apple ($1,245 per share). The mention of ""ridiculous"" might suggest that this is a very strong positive point, possibly because it's so good news. But I'm not sure if it's a clear factor.

Tweet 4 talks about RT's maximum daytrading profits with free alerts for the next week. This could be seen as a positive action to manage risk, which would boost investor sentiment positively.

Tweet 5 is about extreme options trading offering 100% returns with a free trial. If this seems promising or beneficial, it could push investor confidence upwards.

Tweet 6 and 7 both mention the upcoming manufacturing of Google-branded smartphones by China-based companies. This might be a negative factor if it affects demand or supply chain issues in the global market, which can impact stock prices.

Tweets 8 and 9 compare the value of Google to other companies like Exxon Mobil and Apple, suggesting that Google's performance is being seen relative to these competitors. This could influence investor perceptions based on how others perceive each other.

Tweet 10 talks about a facility at SJC being built by a company, which might be more of a business-related action rather than directly affecting the stock price unless it leads to increased production or revenue, but this seems tangential.

Tweets 11 and 12 discuss precision trades with 100% gains. These seem like strong signals that could trigger buy orders if the trader is ready. This is usually a positive signal for investors because they are confident in their strategies.

Now, considering all these factors, I should assess each tweet's sentiment relative to the stock and combine them. Let me go through each one:

1. Positive: YHOO's pre-market high could be positive.
2. Negative: HON's forecast of a net loss is definitely negative.
3. Positive: The earnings estimate for ARL seems very strong, which might boost investor confidence.
4. Positive: RT's risk management strategy sounds good and would likely help.
5. Positive: The free trial options suggest potential gains, which could be positive sentiment.
6. Negative: Chinese production could affect global demand, so this is a negative factor.
7. Similar to 6, another Chinese production-related tweet.
8. Relative valuation between Google and others might not directly affect stock price unless it's seen as undervalued or overvalued.
9. Similar to 8, again relative valuation which doesn't impact current stock.
10. Business expansion but probably unrelated to the company.
11. Positive: Precision trades with strong gains could trigger a buy order.
12. Similarly positive.

Considering all these, most tweets have mixed signals—some positives and some negatives. However, tweet 2 is very clear on an earnings forecast that's likely negative. The rest are either very strong (tweets 3,4,5) or tangential to the company in question. There's a mix of positives and one big negative.

In conclusion, while there are mixed signals, the overall sentiment seems to lean towards positive because several tweets suggest increased confidence due to business actions like facility expansions and potential gains from trades."
2014-02-11,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on Google's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. That should help me see what information is being conveyed. For example, some tweets mention ""GOOG"" which would be Google.

Looking at the tweets:

1. ""rt AT_USER $ goog @ 19x2014 est operating profit . at same multiple $ aapl = $ 1,245 per share . ridiculous . keep buying tim ! you still have …"" Hmm, this tweet is talking about Google's profits and mentions something about Tim, maybe an employee. The fact that the user is saying it's ""ridiculous"" might be a bit confusing, but I think they're just expressing frustration or disappointment in their situation.

2. "" insider trading news on $ kool $ xrsc $ md $ goog must see URL"" This one is talking about some insider information being revealed and suggests someone should check the URL. Insiders usually have positive signals because they have knowledge of the market.

3. ""AT_USER AT_USER $ goog $ aapl $ nflx must join forces to build out nation wide state of art fiber system . att & comcast wont do it ."" This seems like another insider update about Google wanting to collaborate on something and mentions that two big companies won't help, which is positive because it gives the insider an advantage.

4. "" insider trading news on $ irm $ clgx $ sai $ goog visit URL"" Similar to tweet 2, this is about insider info but for another company. They're suggesting someone should check a specific URL, so maybe they have information that could influence others.

5. "" rt . AT_USER $ goog and $ fb accounted for 60 % of $ 100bn global internet ad market last year , up from 35 % in 2006 URL"" This is another positive point about Google's advertising presence, indicating growth which can boost stock prices.

6. "" rt AT_USER trades making 80 to 100 % daily get free 1 week alerts URL $ tsla $ goog"" Again, insider trading info with the idea of free alerts, so more positive signals for investors.

7. ""$ mcp should see nice action as ree prices are bouncing back . 120 % upside $ aapl $ goog $ fb"" This one is about rareearths and rareearths (REE) whose prices are expected to go up by 120%. This sounds like positive news for REE, which could indirectly affect Google if they have a product or service in common.

8. "" rt AT_USER high performance daytrading free alerts for a week try now URL $ aapl $ goog"" Positive signals about trading strategies and alerts, which can boost investor confidence and stock prices.

9. Same as tweet 5, another positive ad account growth: 60% compared to 35% from 2006. This reinforces Google's growing business presence.

10. "" google inc : next generation nexus 10 to be made by htc ?"" This is a news about Google's product (Nexus 10) being planned for another company, HTOC. This might signal that Google is investing in future developments or partnerships, which could positively impact their stock.

11. Frenchman fined for ' theft' and fraudulent retention for finding health docs via $ goog search URL. This seems like they're investigating fraud, so the fine could be seen as a positive outcome (good deal), which would benefit Google if their services are affected by this incident.

12. ""this is extreme daytrading try free for 1 week URL $ aapl $ goog"" Negative signals about trading strategies and offering free alerts for a week, which can hurt stock prices.

13. anticipation tweet: ""am anticipation 02/11 : focus on janetyellen and fed & apple & google being watched $ aapl $ goog URL."" Positive, hoping Google will perform well as they watch the companies mentioned.

14. Same as tweets 1 and 5: positive ad account growth. This reinforces that Google is doing well in their advertising efforts.

15. Same as tweet 6: insider trading about alerts for TSLA and Google. More positive info here too.

16. ""stocks to hold onto $ tco $ epl $ sxc $ goog click URL"" Positive signals suggesting stock holdings are important, so investors might be cautious.

Now, let's summarize the factors from each tweet:

- Positive tweets: 2,3,5,8,9,10,11,13,14,15,16. These indicate that Google is performing well in their operations, products, or services.
- Negative tweets: 1,4,7,12. These suggest that there's uncertainty, lack of information, or rumors about other companies.

The factors are mostly positive except for a couple of negative ones. The overall sentiment seems mixed but leans more towards positive because the positive tweets reinforce each other and indicate growth in multiple areas. Although there are some negatives, they might not outweigh the positives enough to make it all-negative."
2014-02-12,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the future stock price of a company. The user provided 19 tweets, and each one is about various topics related to the stock market. I remember from previous examples that the process involves identifying the target stock symbol and then evaluating each tweet for positive or negative factors.

First, looking at the target stock mentioned in all these tweets, it seems like TSLA (Tic-Tac-Toe Limited) based on the ones starting with $ tsla. So my main focus is on TSLA's performance.

Now, I'll go through each tweet one by one and categorize them into positive, negative, or neutral factors related to TSLA.

1. ** insider trading news**: This could be a bad sign because insider info often affects stock prices negatively.
2. **79% smartphone market in 2013**: That's about the phone market, which might influence consumer spending and potentially tech stocks like TSLA if they see growth, but it seems out of context for TSLA's performance.
3. **R&D in R&D**- mentions tracking a company called ""wheelbarrows,"" which doesn't relate to TSLA's product developments.
4. **U.S. internet influence**: This is about global influence rather than TSLA-specific tech products.
5. **Lenovo buy motorola**: Focus on the company, not the specific sector or technology segment (like Android phones).
6. **Great moderation in mobile phone market**: Again, a broader topic affecting the overall economy but not directly tied to TSLA's performance.
7. **Extreme daytrading**: Mentioning alerts for 1 week could be more about trading strategies than actual stock moves.
8. **Trending topics**: More about general tech trends rather than specific company performance.
9. **Daytrading trial**: Similar to the previous one, focusing on trading methods rather than specific company info.
10. **50% average trade**: Again, broad trading statistics unrelated to TSLA's stock.
11. **Fedral airfield move**: This is about a government project, not related to tech companies like TSLA.
12. **Sectors being ""trending right now"" - probably general market trends, not specific to TSLA.
13. **Extreme daytrading alert sign up for free 1 week**: More trading strategy focus than actual stock performance.
14. **Movers in tech research** - about moving towards specific tech sectors but doesn't clarify if it's relevant to TSLA.
15. **Google dragging S&P down**: If Google is pulling the stock price lower, that would be a negative factor for TSLA.
16. **ThinkPad stocks rising**: This could affect overall tech stocks like TSLA, so positive or neutral based on expectations.
17. **Stock market reports** - general tech news but might mention specific companies.
18. **Technology launch by Nokia**: If this relates to specific technology products, it would be a positive factor for TSLA if the products are in line with TSLA's operations.
19. **Tech shares climbing** - Again, broader market trends affecting tech stocks, not specific to TSLA.

Now, evaluating each tweet:

- **Sentiment Analysis**: All tweets seem neutral or slight negative because they cover a wide range of topics without focusing on TSLA specifically. Only a couple are more about the company's stock performance indirectly (like $ goog cloud topics trending right now).
  
- **Overall Sentiment Summary**: Given that most tweets are broader market trends, except for two which might be slightly negative, I would consider the overall sentiment neutral because there's no clear positive or negative signal focused on TSLA.

So, after considering all these points, my conclusion should reflect a neutral stance as there's significant uncertainty due to various unrelated factors."
2014-02-13,Positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of [Apple Inc.] based on the provided information. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I see that none of the tweets explicitly mention Apple's stock symbol, which is ""AAPL."" That makes it a bit tricky because without knowing the specific company, it's hard to evaluate the sentiment directly. But maybe I can infer based on the context or other factors mentioned in the tweets.

Looking at each tweet:

1. The first tweet talks about extreme options trading and mentions some URL links, but no direct Apple info.
2. The second one is about research on competitors like Oxy and AVP.
3. The third one discusses bullish sentiment and stock looks.
4. The fourth tweet asks if it's a breakout time, which relates to stock price trends.
5. The fifth tweet mentions Sam'ssubs and aims to blow up an account, potentially implying potential gain or loss.
6. The sixth is about James Dyson aiming to take on IRobot, tech-related.
7. The seventh mentions technicals and consolidation for Google.
8. The eighth says Apple has 100% downloads since 2007, so maybe Apple's ecosystem is strong.
9. The ninth tweet talks about account doubling with a free sign-up.
10. The tenth discusses stocks like ETCF and MCK.
11. The eleventh mentions a play involving lenovo and Google glasses.
12. The twelfth provides info on other financials like HIG, CNA, COH.
13. The thirteenth is about a stock action based on a quote.
14. The fourteenth talks about extreme trading with Aapl and goog offers a free trial.
15. Another mention of Google downloads from 2007.
16. The fifteenth tweet says Google is undervalued, maybe implying Apple could be overvalued.
17. It suggests that Google surpassed XOM (Xbox One) as the largest company in terms of market cap.

So, without the exact stock symbol, I'm trying to see if any tweets can hint at Apple's position relative to other companies or sectors. For example, the eighth tweet talks about 100% downloads since 2007, which could mean strong ecosystem, but it's not specific to Apple. The twelfth mentions financial info on competitors.

The ninth tweet is interesting because it doubles accounts, which might suggest potential for more trades, possibly affecting price. The fourth tweet is a question about stock trends, so if the user thinks it's a good time, that could be positive sentiment.

Looking at other tweets: the third suggests Google is in consolidation, maybe Apple is looking for opportunities. The fifth mentions Sam blowing up an account, which is speculative but might suggest increased risk or uncertainty. The twelfth doesn't directly mention Apple, so I'm not sure if it's relevant.

Putting it all together, some tweets are speculative, while others mention strong sectors or undervalued stocks. However, without knowing the exact stock symbol, it's hard to determine a clear overall sentiment. But considering factors like Google being in a consolidation phase and other companies' performance, maybe Apple is facing some opportunities, which could make the stock positive.

I'm leaning towards a Positive overall sentiment because of speculative trends, strong sectors, and potential for increased trade activity."
2014-02-14,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of the company. So, I have six tweets here, and each is about Google's stock, which I assume is $ goog. 

First, I need to go through each tweet one by one. Starting with the first one: ""$ goog - third of eu commissioners oppose google antitrust deal - officials -> URL stock stocks stockaction"". Hmm, this seems like a news event related to Google's legal position on an antitrust deal. The EU commissioners are part of the company, so if they oppose the deal, it could affect investor sentiment. I remember that opposition usually leads investors to doubt the stock price and maybe reduce their buying power.

Next is ""$ goog google deems android ready for more chromecast apps , let the floodgate ... URL"". This tweet mentions Android apps getting more features, especially chromecast support. I know that Google has a history of introducing new features, but it's not something I'd expect to cause immediate positive news regarding their stock price. Maybe this is just talking about an ongoing project, so perhaps it's neutral.

Then there's ""rt AT_USER excluding cash , $ goog is now more valuable than $ aapl : URL"". The user is saying that removing cash will make Google more valuable compared to Apple. That seems like a strong opinion because removing cash can lower stock prices. Investors might be scared of losing their money, leading to a negative sentiment.

The fourth tweet says ""rt AT_USER this is extreme daytrading free trial now URL $ aapl $ goog"". Daytrading with a free trial sounds risky for investors. They're probably looking to make quick trades, which could lead to emotional investing and decreased confidence in the stock, thus negative sentiment.

Looking at the fifth tweet: ""looking to avoid mistakes like $ fnf $ dva $ vtr $ goog stock URL"". This is talking about avoiding specific stocks related to Google's stock. It seems like a cautionary note advising investors to avoid certain risks or stock movements. That might lead some people to avoid buying Google, which can hurt their position.

Lastly, ""AT_USER would you consider buying $ aapl and $ goog ?"". The user is asking for advice on whether to buy both stocks. This seems more of an open-ended question where potential investors are trying to make their own decisions. I don't have immediate information about the company's fundamentals or future plans, so this could lead to mixed feelings.

Now, summarizing each tweet: The first mentions a major legal case affecting investor sentiment negatively. The second is speculative but possibly neutral. The third and fifth tweets are cautionary pro tips, while the fourth is more of an investment avoidance tactic. Without specific details on the company's fundamentals or future plans, it's hard to assess if these tweets have a strong positive or negative impact. But considering all factors, some might be positive in terms of advice but others could be neutral or even negative due to fear of market changes.

Overall, I think there's a mix of mixed and neutral sentiment here. Some tweets provide good information that could positively influence the stock price if taken seriously, while others present risk-averse advice which might not have a strong impact. The overall sentiment seems uncertain but leaning towards some positive aspects."
2014-02-15,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze the given tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for ""goog"" based on the provided criteria.

First, let's identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. The first tweet starts with ""rt AT_USER google has acquired 143 companies since it was founded . here's a list showing the last 25 : URL $ goog"". So, the stock is ""goog"".

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one and break them down into positive (P) or negative (N) factors.

1. **rt AT_USER google has acquired 143 companies since it was founded . here's a list showing the last 25 : URL $ goog**
   - Positive factor: Acquisition of multiple companies.
   - No obvious negative points mentioned.
   - Impact: Acquiring other businesses can lead to increased revenue, diversification, and potential growth. This is a positive sign.

2. **rt AT_USER trades produce 100 % same day sign up for free 1 week alerts URL $ aapl $ goog**
   - Positive factor: Free alerts and services.
   - No negative points mentioned.
   - Impact: Free or low-cost services can be a good indicator of the company's reliability, which may boost investor confidence. However, since this is about Google trading with Apple (AAPL), it might show interest in their partnership.

3. **rt AT_USER small-cap stocks setting new 52 - wk high prices $ spn $ avb $ cog $ goog view now URL**
   - Positive factor: Small-cap companies reaching new highs.
   - No negative points.
   - Impact: Growth potential and higher valuations can attract investors, leading to increased demand for Google's stock. This is positive.

4. **rt AT_USER triple digit returns from daytrades sign up for free 1 week alerts URL $ aapl $ goog**
   - Positive factor: Free trading and alerts.
   - No negatives mentioned.
   - Impact: Such offers can create buzz, attract investors, which may drive price increases. It's another positive note.

5. **$ goog google working on offering 10 gigabits / per second internet speed URL**
   - Positive factor: Technical improvements for faster data transfer.
   - No negative points mentioned.
   - Impact: Faster connectivity can improve efficiency and user experience, which is a positive sign that the stock may perform well.

6. **rt AT_USER trades making 80 to 100 % daily try free for 1 week URL $ aapl $ goog**
   - Positive factor: Free options with good value.
   - No negatives noted.
   - Impact: Offering better deals can attract more customers and reduce competition, which is beneficial for Google.

7. **rt AT_USER extreme options trading for 100 % returns free alerts for a week try now URL $ goog $ tsla**
   - Positive factor: Extensive trading with no hidden costs or restrictions.
   - No negatives mentioned.
   - Impact: Such high-value trades can attract more investors, possibly increasing demand. This is a strong positive.

8. **google inc : valentine's day is ' immoral , ' says saudi cleric URL $ goog**
   - Negative factor: Refuse to discuss topics that might be considered controversial or inappropriate.
   - Negative point mentioned, but it was about valentines' day and a Saudi cleric's remarks.
   - Impact: Refusing to talk about inappropriate content could affect investor trust. This can lead to concerns about the company's ethical practices, which may negatively impact stock price.

9. **get great research on stocks $ fdx $ fnf $ goog $ rt try this URL**
   - Positive factor: Encouraging investors with good research.
   - No negative points mentioned.
   - Impact: Positive research can attract more investors and improve investor sentiment, leading to potential higher stock prices. This is a positive note.

10. **rt AT_USER google has acquired 143 companies since it was founded . here's a list showing the last 25 : URL $ goog**
    - Same as tweet 1.
    - Positive factor: Continued acquisition history, which indicates growth and diversification.
    - Impact: This reinforces Google's expansion, which is good for long-term health.

Now, compiling these factors:

- **Positive Factors**: There are multiple positive points like acquiring companies, free services, technical improvements, and research. These all suggest strong fundamentals and potential market responses.
- **Negative Factor**: The last tweet about Saudi cleric's comments about valentines' day is negative because it involves inappropriate content.

However, the negative factor was only one out of ten tweets. The overall impact depends on how these factors stack up against each other. Acquiring multiple companies, free services, and technical improvements (tweets 1-4) are strong positives. But the negative comment about valentines' day is a single point that might tip the balance slightly.

Considering all aspects, while there's a mild negative note, the majority of tweets are positive or neutral. Therefore, it leans more towards a [Positive] overall sentiment."
2014-02-16,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price of a company. The target stock is Google, represented by ""goog"". Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet says, ""rt AT_USER google has fooled the media and markets , but hasn't bested AT_USER apple $ aapl $. This seems like an unrelated mention about Apple, which isn't directly about Google. So maybe it's just a distraction or a minor observation about stock exchanges.

2. The second tweet is similar: ""$ goog google inc ( goog ) news : google taking over sports : youtube should take ... : google inc ( goog ) news : goo ... URL"". Again, this is talking about a company called ""google"", but again it's focusing on Google and the sports industry. No clear positive or negative impact on Google itself.

3. The third tweet mentions "" killer daytrading system for stocks futures options free alerts for a week try now URL $ aapl $ goog "". It sounds like someone is offering a trading system, which could be a positive sign because it might help potential investors make decisions. The mention of alerts suggests they're providing valuable information.

4. The fourth tweet says, ""how google plans to expand into a massive , untapped market $ goog URL"". Here, Google's future expansion plan is mentioned. This is generally seen as a positive signal because it could lead to more growth and revenue, which is good for the stock price.

5. The fifth tweet: ""high performance daytrading free alerts for a week try now URL $ aapl $ goog"". Similar to the third tweet, it's offering trading tools. More trading-related content might help investors, but without specifics on what Google does, it's hard to assess the impact directly.

6. The sixth tweet is about "" killer daytrading system for stocks futures options get free week of alerts URL $ goog $ tsla"". Again, this suggests someone is providing a trading tool and offers alerts, which could potentially benefit potential investors by helping them make informed decisions.

Putting it all together, the tweets are offering trading tools (like free alerts) that are related to Google. These might help traders or investors who use Google services to make better decisions. This could provide some liquidity to the market as people might use these tools to engage with the company more. However, since the content is about tools and not specific news related to the stock itself, it's a bit of a gray area in terms of direct impact on the stock price.

But given that these are trading-related offers, they can create buzz or attract trades, which might help the market in the short term by increasing activity. So overall, while there might be some indirect positive effects, the sentiment seems mixed because it's not about the company itself but about the offerings provided."
2014-02-17,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the future stock price of a company. Let me start by breaking down each tweet and analyzing them one by one.

First, looking at tweet 1: ""AT_USER wonder if jc's comparison of $ fb $ twtr to $ ko $ pep will soon become fb $ goog story . mark on indexing in cc enlightening ."" It seems like the user is checking a comparison between two stocks. The mention of comparing companies and relating them to Google is interesting, but I'm not sure how that affects investors yet.

Next, tweet 2: ""$ vvc free research on $ ccl $ dst $ goog singedinvestor URL."" This looks like it's providing some free information or research on the company's stock. Singing investor URLs usually indicate that there's some activity or interest in the stock from investors.

Tweet 3: ""stocks to sell $ hhc $ emr $ eix $ goog check out URL."" The user is suggesting selling stocks, which could mean they're considering divesting from a portfolio. This action can affect stock price, especially if the company's fundamentals are weakening or if there are risks involved.

Tweet 4: ""buy or sell ? $ fsl $ dlr $ cbt $ goog give it a try URL."" Here, the user is offering to buy or sell based on some research. Similar to tweet 2, this could indicate that they're considering an investment decision and have some informational lead.

Now, looking at the output requirement, I need to conclude with ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]."" The overall sentiment seems positive because while there are mentions of selling stocks and free research, it's also providing information that might make investors more inclined to buy. Additionally, suggesting a buy offer could be seen as a positive signal for potential growth.

So, considering all the tweets, despite some speculative actions like selling or offering trades, there's an underlying interest in the company's stock through free research and potential future buys. This suggests a positive overall sentiment."
2014-02-18,Neutral,"Okay, I'm looking at these tweets and trying to figure out their impact on the stock price for a company. The user mentioned they need an analysis where each tweet is separated into positive and negative factors, then evaluate how each affects sentiment.

First, tweet 1 talks about a bear case scenario affecting GORP, GOOG, etc., which are likely tech companies. So that's definitely a bearish factor. But I don't have the stock symbol, so I can't specify the exact company, but it's clear it's a negative outlook for these stocks.

Next, tweet 2 mentions bullish sentiment on OMC, FOM, GOOG, etc., which are tech stocks too. So that's positive for those companies.

Tweet 3 talks about a break-out time in HRC, MKC, VTR, and GOOG. Again, this is a bearish note because it's a strategic move to enter into a market. It could lead to a positive stock reaction but also some hesitation or fear of being out of the market.

Tweet 4 asks to find the next FDX, ALTR, IPGP for GOOG. That might be a neutral factor since it's about researching a future action without any immediate impact on sentiment yet.

Tweet 5 says to buy FULT, PII, LRY for GOOG. This seems positive because it's an explicit offer to invest money in these stocks, which usually boosts their prices.

 Tweets 6-12 are all bullish on several tech companies including HPQ, WAB, GOOG, APL, MONEyu. These seem like strong signs of optimism about the tech sector and future growth, which is positive for those stocks.

Now, looking at overall sentiment: some tweets are clearly negative (tweets 1 and 3), while others are more neutral or even bullish (tweets 2,4,5,6-12). The mix isn't too skewed; there are a few bearish factors but most of the rest are positive. It's a mixed bag, so I think it's [Neutral] overall."
2014-02-19,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price for the given company. The user provided a list of tweets and asked me to analyze them to predict the stock's overall sentiment.

First, let me break down the process step by step as outlined in the solving process. The steps are: identify the target stock symbol, then analyze each tweet, separating positive and negative factors, assessing sentiment for each, and finally summarizing the overall sentiment.

Looking at the tweets provided:

1. ""small-cap stocks setting new 52 - wk high prices $ atk $ cab $ goog $ aapl research URL"" – This seems to be promoting the stock with some keywords like small-cap and positive terms related to price performance.
2. ""and there goes $ goog under 1200 ..."" – This is a negative note, suggesting the stock is undervalued because it's below 1200. That’s pretty concerning.
3. ""$ goog google capital lands $ 300 million and leaps into web education : google capital lands $ 300 million and l ... URL"" – Here, they're increasing their investment in Google with a significant amount. This positive action might be seen as a good sign for the stock.
4. ""looking for the next performer like $ pcln $ nsr $ dtv $ goog view now URL"" – Promoting future performers could indicate investor interest or confidence in the company's future prospects, which is generally positive.
5. ""in the $ goog 1210 weekly calls for 3.80"" – This mentions stock price and a specific call rate. A higher stock price might be seen as strong, but without context on why it's higher, it's hard to say.
6. ""rt AT_USER google calls stupid glass-wearers ' ' glassholes . ' ' well , duh ! ~ itbw for AT_USER $ goog ~ ~ ~ URL"" – This seems like a playful and possibly negative comment, using humor or absurdity about Google's stock price.
7. ""$ goog bay area cities that are invited to discuss installation of google fiber : s . j . , palo Alto , mountain view , sunnyvale and santa clara . $ goog"" – Promoting an action in a location context might indicate investment interest, which is positive.
8. ""msft new onedrive is pretty bad ass ! sign up and get free stroage !"" – This tweet suggests that Microsoft's product is great, so customers get free storage. That could be seen as favorable for the stock.

Now, I need to assess each tweet's impact:

1. Promoting stock performance with positive keywords seems like a positive signal.
2. Negative note about underperforming might significantly affect sentiment.
3. Increasing investment in Google suggests good news for the company, which is positive.
4. Promoting future performers can boost investor confidence.
5. High stock price could be seen as strong, but without context on why it's high, it's uncertain.
6. Playful and negative humor using absurd terms might lead to negative sentiment.
7. Investment promotion in a location context adds interest, which is positive.
8. Promoting a good product can boost stock value.

Considering all these, the tweet about Google capital landing $300 million with new education web tech seems like it's adding significant investment and could be seen as attractive. The negative note about Google being undervalued (tweet 2) might have some weight but not enough to overshadow the other positive points. 

The overall sentiment is a mix of some positives, one significant promotion, and a mixed or slightly negative note. However, the major factors point more towards a positive impact because of the strong promotional message about Google capital.

So, I think the stock sentiment is Positive."
2014-02-20,Positive,"Alright, I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the company based on the provided steps. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet talks about a video explaining how Google Earth could save the Earth. It seems like a positive message because it's offering something tangible and might encourage investors to act. So, that's a Positive.

2. The second tweet is a retweet with multiple stock symbols: $ ndx, $ goog, $ bidu. These are all part of the index NDX, which I know tracks exchange-traded funds, not individual stocks. This seems like redundant information and might be positive to avoid confusion.

3. The third tweet mentions Google's upcoming stocks, Facebook, and Suncorp. It looks like it's suggesting investments but doesn't give specific details about the company. Positive because it's an investment opportunity.

4. The fourth tweet is a comment from a user who thinks if Google goes higher, Facebook might get a bargain deal. This seems positive as it suggests a strategic move for growth companies and could boost their stock price.

5. Another retweet with $ goog mentioned again. It reinforces the idea of an investment opportunity that's appealing to long-term growth.

6. The fifth tweet talks about iPhones being expensive but provides info about WhatsApp bought by Android. This seems like a positive message because it might be encouraging investors in tech, possibly Facebook and Google.

7. The sixth tweet mentions $ goog landing at $300 million with web education. It's a positive note about potential expansion into new areas and investment opportunities.

8. Another retweet about WhatsApp being bought by Android. Positive again as it could attract more users and be beneficial to the company.

9. The seventh tweet mentions Google offering to buy WhatsApp for $10 billion. This is a direct mention of an offer, which is usually seen as positive because it's a strategic move that could boost stock price.

10. The eighth tweet about the Fab Five Composite. It seems like a mix of tech stocks and energy-related index, which might indicate sector-specific news but not directly impacting the main company unless there's information about that company.

11. The ninth tweet mentions the next 10 days. This is vague and doesn't provide specific info on how it will affect the stock. It's neutral because it's speculative without concrete data.

12. The tenth tweet about a 1200 value for $ goog. Without knowing if this reflects up or down, but since it's high, maybe positive. Though 1200 isn't standard for stocks; they usually are in thousands of dollars.

13. Another mention of Google's bond sale with strong demand. Positive because a successful investment could improve the company's value.

14. The fifth tweet about fiber for network growth. If it's related to the company, this could be positive as investments in tech can boost profits and stock price.

15. A retweet from AT_USER offering $ goog to buy WhatsApp for $10 billion. This reinforces the idea of a strategic investment opportunity.

16. Another retweet about the same offer. Same logic applies here; it's reinforcing the investment strategy.

17. The same as tweet 16, so similar positive sentiment.

18. The last tweet is from AT_USER talking about their comments and plans to sleep with all their cash. This seems like a personal comment but might be seen as positive by some or neutral if not too controversial.

After evaluating each tweet, the overall sentiment tends toward Positive because most tweets are offering investments, strategic offers, or positive statements about company growth. There's one Neutral tweet (11) and others that don't provide specific information. So the stock is likely to go up."
2014-02-21,Positive,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of $ goog. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock, which is $ goog, or Alphabet Inc., often known as Google. Now, looking at each tweet:

1. ""rt AT_USER google $ goog unveils smartphone with 3D sensors URL."" This seems like a positive statement about Alphabet's innovation and product launch. It mentions something new they're doing with their technology, which could boost their stock price.

2. ""should you buy $ dsw $ rga $ mnk $ goog stock URL."" The user is asking whether to invest in Alphabet's stock. While it's a yes/no question, the word ""should"" suggests that they're evaluating the stock for buying decisions. This might indicate an informational tweet about the stock, which could influence investor sentiment positively or negatively depending on expectations.

3. ""decreased bullishness in $ goog (sentiment score of 1.81 on a scale of 0-4)."" The tweet mentions that there's decreased bullishness regarding Alphabet. A positive factor here would be if people feel more optimistic, but the negative sentiment might reduce this optimism. This could lead to uncertainty about future performance.

4. ""$ goog google inc. wants to map your surroundings, but in a good way."" The tweet is expressing a desire for positive interactions with others. This can be seen as encouraging investment because it's about building connections or improving customer experience, which could positively impact the stock price by attracting more users and increasing demand.

5. ""$ goog google inc. refinances $1 - billion debt through bond sale."" Refinancing a large debt issue is generally good for financial stability. If Alphabet can refinance their debt with bonds, it might free up capital, improving their cash position. This could lead to increased investor interest or confidence, which would be positive sentiment.

6. ""$ twtr twitter to release server orders to taiwan Odms."" The tweet mentions releasing server orders from Twitter to Taiwan's Odms (Optical Disk Management). This seems unrelated. It might cause some buzz but doesn't directly impact Alphabet's operations or future performance. So this could have a slight positive effect on company reputation, which would be a minor factor.

7. ""looking for winners like $ xec $ ggg $ amty $ has $ goog overvalued."" The user is searching for good opportunities (winners) but is also indicating that Alphabet might be overpriced. Overvaluation could mean lower demand or less growth potential, which might reduce investor confidence in Alphabet's future performance.

8. ""$ goog for whatsapp, keeping things simple is both a draw and a handicap."" This tweet seems to present two sides: it's beneficial as a tool (draw) but also makes users feel ""handicapped"" by requiring simplicity. While the user finds value in simplicity, the ""handicap"" aspect might reduce investor sentiment if they think simplicity limits options or potential complexity. This could lead to uncertainty.

9. ""get great research on stocks $ ctrx $ exc $ esys $ ip $ goog view now."" The tweet offers expert research on Alphabet's stocks. While this is positive information, it doesn't directly state whether Alphabet will perform well. It might influence investor decision-making by providing insights, which could lead to more informed decisions and potentially higher stock price.

10. ""pennystock research on $ amcx $ bg $ pacb $ pld $ goog worth a look."" Similar to the previous tweet, this is informational about Alphabet's stock. It adds to the investor's information, which can help them make better decisions but doesn't necessarily predict future performance.

Now, summarizing each tweet:

- Tweets 1 and 4 are positive in nature.
- Tweets 3 is negative because of decreased bullishness.
- Tweets 5, 7, 8, and 9 could be positive if there's good news about Alphabet, negative if bad news, or neutral otherwise.
- Tweet 6 seems related but not directly impacting Alphabet.

Combining these thoughts: Positive tweets (1,4,5) provide good info and are encouraging. Negative tweet (3) may reduce confidence. Neutral tweets (7,8,9) could affect sentiment slightly. Tweet 6 is speculative. The overall positive sentiment from the tweets points to a strong outlook for Alphabet.

Therefore, the stock price is likely going to increase."
2014-02-22,Neutral,"Alright, I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me start by analyzing each tweet.

The first tweet is ""AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER $ goog gruber pla . you'll see why they pay this guy that much . he's worth it from a science end."" The user is talking about something related to investing, mentioning ""gruber pla,"" which I think stands for Google Play. They're talking about how they value him and are suggesting he's worth it in the scientific field. This sounds positive because it's encouraging investment in tech, specifically Google, which could be a good sign for the stock price.

The second tweet is ""rt AT_USER get stock market reports on $ glw $ cab $ jdas $ goog $ vlo goto URL."" The user is asking about stock reports but not specifying any particular company. Without context or more information, it's hard to assess the sentiment directly. Maybe it's neutral because it could be a source of news that doesn't directly affect the stock unless we have more details.

The third tweet is ""bullish on these stocks $ fnfg $ shw $ fnlc $ aee $ goog view now URL."" This seems positive, stating bullish confidence on certain stocks related to Google. Positive statements usually indicate good expectations and can boost investor sentiment, which might lead to an increase in stock price.

The fourth tweet is ""whats happening with $ ntrs $ cbsh $ stc $ grpn $ goog money URL."" The user is asking about financial matters but again, without more context or specifics, it's ambiguous. It could be positive if things are going well, negative if there are concerns, or neutral otherwise.

Now, combining these tweets: two positive statements from the first and third tweet suggest that investors have a strong outlook on Google. The second tweet is too vague for a clear sentiment. The fourth tweet also seems uncertain but might lean towards positive unless something unexpected happens in financial matters. 

Overall, the positive tweets are a stronger indicator of investor confidence and expectations. They could lead to a rise in stock price if they translate into buying intentions or if positive trends cause buy orders. However, without more context, it's hard to be certain, so I'll consider this a mix of signals towards an upward trend but also some uncertainty."
2014-02-23,Neutral,"Okay, so I'm trying to analyze these tweets about the stock price impact on a company. The goal is to determine whether each tweet suggests a positive, neutral, or negative effect on the stock. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to figure out which stock each tweet is referring to. Looking at the first tweet: ""$ couple of stocks to watch $ vly $ pnra $ adi $ goog check out URL."" Hmm, that seems like it's talking about several companies related to Google since they're all named after things Google might invest in or be involved with. The term ""check out URL"" could imply that the user is looking for a website for their stock.

Next tweet: ""$ goog - [ video ] instagram slowly rolls out ads -> URL stock stocks stockaction."" This seems like it's talking about Google specifically, using hashtags and indicators of media influence or trends related to Google. The mention of ""ads"" suggests potential positive or negative impact on the stock based on increased revenue.

Third tweet: ""$ goog - invasion of the taxi snatchers : uber leads an industries disruption -> URL stock stocks stockaction."" This is referring again to Google, mentioning Uber's involvement in a disruption within the tech industry. Disruption could either positively or negatively affect the stock, depending on how it impacts the company or its customers.

Fourth tweet: ""get research on $ cpwr $ wtw $ sd $ aep $ goog liquidity URL."" The user is looking for information about the company with these ticker symbols and mentions liquidity. Liquidity could be seen as an opportunity to improve their financial position, which might affect stock price.

Fifth tweet: ""$ goog - best pennystock research $ data $ laz $ casm $ msft $ goog financialnews URL."" Similar to the first tweet, it's referring to multiple stocks related to Google and involves financial news. The mention of ""best pennystock"" could be positive, suggesting investment in a favorable stock.

Sixth tweet: ""$ goog - google ventures invests in atlanta startup ionic security -> URL stock stocks stockaction."" Here, Google is investing in a startup in Atlanta, which can have both positive and negative implications. If the startup is successful, it might boost the stock; if not, there could be concerns.

Seventh tweet: ""$ goog lg debuts its new , amply-sized mini URL"" (I think there's an inconsistency here, missing the space after ""lg""). But assuming it's about a Google-related product or company launching something, that could have various effects on the stock depending on the specifics of the launch.

Now, for each tweet, I need to assess factors and sentiment. Starting with tweet 1: It mentions multiple stocks related to Google, but without specific details, it's hard to gauge exact impact. However, ""check out URL"" might be suggesting a website, which could imply they're looking at a stock that's being researched or discussed elsewhere.

Tweet 2 is about Google specifically with a video and Instagram ads. Positive keywords here like ""ads"" can indicate potential positive impacts on stock performance, so this could be [Positive].

Tweet 3 mentions Uber as leading an industry disruption in tech. This could mean improved efficiency or customer service, which might positively affect the stock. So, [Positive].

Tweet 4 is about research and liquidity for a company with specific ticker symbols. Liquidity is positive because it can improve financial health, so this could be [Positive].

Tweet 5 talks about researching a pennystock and involves financial news. If they're investing in a favorable stock, that's good, but if not, there might be negative thoughts. However, since it's the best among several, it suggests potential positive investment, so [Positive].

Tweet 6 is about Google investing in an Atlanta startup. This could have mixed effects depending on the startup. Without more info, it's hard to say, but maybe a favorable outcome.

Tweet 7 is about Google launching something new, which is vague. If it's good news for investors, it might be [Positive]; if bad, then [Negative].

Overall, several tweets are positive because they mention Google and potential investments or media influence on stock prices. Some have uncertainty due to the specific stocks involved but could hint at mixed effects."
2014-02-24,Negative,"Alright, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on TSLA stock. Let me break it down step by step.

First, from the first tweet, TSLA is mentioned, and other stocks are noted with their respective symbols and price ranges. That seems like just a general mention without specific information, so maybe that's neutral.

The second tweet talks about vehicle infotainment systems being a likely tailwind for companies like blackberry (BBRY) and NVIDIA (NVDA). I remember NVIDIA was down before, but after the tech boom, they saw growth. So this could be a positive impact on their stock prices.

Looking at the third tweet, it says all these stocks posted amazing Q's followed by big continuations higher: UAA, NFLX, Wynn, KORS, FB, and GOOG. This looks like a strong bullish sign because companies seeing increases in Q growth are expected to perform well. Positive.

The fourth tweet mentions Nokia succumbs to Android appeal, which could be negative if it affects their performance, especially if they switch suppliers. That could impact their stock price negatively.

Now, combining all these factors: The first tweet is general, so neutral. The second has a possible positive tailwind for NVIDIA and BBRY. The third shows strong growth expectations, which is definitely positive. The fourth introduces uncertainty about supplier changes, which could push the stock lower.

So overall, some negative factors but with significant positive trends ahead. I think this leans more towards positive because even though there's some uncertainty, the market seems to be building momentum."
2014-02-25,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the likely impact on the stock price of the given company based on these tweets. Let me start by breaking down each tweet and analyzing them step by step.

First, the user mentioned that they want to determine the impact on a specific company's stock price using the provided tweets. They gave a clear set of steps: identify the target stock symbol, analyze each tweet for positive or negative factors, assess sentiment, combine the results, and then conclude with one of three tags.

Looking at the tweets:

1. The first two tweets are just repeating ""rt AT_USER why tesla ' s crazy market valuations are driving us back to cash ! ! ! $ tsla $ nflx $ amzn $ goog partylikeits 1999 - - http ..."" It seems like they're just listing the stock names without any analysis. I'll need to consider this as neutral since no clear factors are presented.

2. The third tweet is similar, repeating the same sentence again. Again, nothing stands out in terms of sentiment or factors, so it's likely neutral.

3. Fourth tweet mentions Google's orange talks and a reasonable price, which could imply support for the stock. This might be positive because investors are buying more due to favorable news.

4. Fifth tweet is another repeat of the first one, so again, nothing changes from previous ones. So, no impact here.

5. Sixth tweet introduces Facebook paying Microsoft fairly, which might indicate that other stocks are being supported, but it's unclear if this affects Tesla directly.

6. Seventh tweet connects amzn to several companies like CMG and FB, suggesting possible support or potential for buybacks. It's a bit vague without specifics on the impact on Tesla.

7. Eighth tweet talks about Google exclusive roadblocks to stop distracted drivers, which could be related to labor issues but not directly affecting stock prices unless it affects the company's performance.

8. Ninth tweet repeats the first one again, so no new info here.

9. Tenth tweet is another repeat of the fourth tweet, so nothing changes from what's already been discussed.

10. Eleventh tweet mentions Google setting roadblocks to stop distracted drivers, which again ties into labor issues but doesn't directly impact Tesla stock price.

11. Twelfth tweet repeats the first one, no new info.

12. Thirteenth tweet discussesbs and government getting its foot in the door, and mentions $ goog and $ aapl as lobbyists. This could indicate support for these stocks, which might indirectly affect Tesla's stock if they see opportunities there.

13. Fourteenth tweet highlights that three stocks—TSLA, GOOG, and PCLN—are hitting new all-time highs today. This is positive news because it indicates investors are buying up shares when prices peak, which usually leads to an upward trend in stock price.

Now, compiling the analysis:

- The user talks about Tesla's valuations being driven by market sentiment towards cash.
- Facebook's stock is seen as a reasonable investment, possibly due to favorable news.
- Amzn and PCLN are also mentioned as having new highs, which could be good for Tesla if they see increased demand.

The tweets seem to have some positive points about potential investments in related stocks but don't present strong evidence that would directly push Tesla's stock price up. The focus is more on supporting other companies and investor sentiment rather than a direct impact on Tesla itself.

Therefore, while there are some positive signals and mentions of upcoming highs, the data presented doesn't strongly indicate a clear positive or negative trend for Tesla's stock price."
2014-02-26,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out the analysis for these tweets about Google's stock. So, the user has given me 21 tweets, and I need to determine if each is positive, neutral, or negative regarding Google's future stock price.

First, looking at tweet 1: It mentions $pki getting stock market reports on pcar, goog, etc. That seems like a news event, which could influence investor sentiment positively because it's about the company's performance and stock information.

Tweet 2 talks about tech acquisitions with Apple, Google, Facebook, etc., which suggests that there might be some growth or investment interest in Google as part of those acquisitions, so positive.

Tweet 3 is about WhatsApp's user behavior. It's not directly related to Google products but rather how users interact on the platform. This could affect market sentiment indirectly, maybe because social media can influence stock prices, but I'm less sure it's a strong driver here.

Tweet 4 mentions Zuckergberg fretting over profits and suggests Tesla might reach $1k in next 3-5 years. Positive news about future earnings could boost the stock.

Tweets 5 to 7 are all about valuations driving Tesla back to cash, which is positive because it's a sign that investors expect better returns, so overall this seems positive.

Tweet 8 talks about Tesla hitting $1k in profits, which reinforces the positive sentiment from previous ones.

Tweets 9 and 10 mention Google getting into an inquiry for motorola, but I'm not sure what that means. It could be a mistake or an unrelated event; it's unclear if this affects Google's stock positively or negatively.

Tweets 11-13 are about valuations again, which is consistent with the positive trend from tweets 5-7 and 8.

Tweets 14 repeats tweet 10's information, so no new info there. Tweets 15 to 21 mostly talk about Google Maps features or products (like Google Glass) but don't provide specific information about Google's performance affecting the stock. So maybe these are neutral as they aren't directly related.

So overall, most tweets seem positive except for some that might be too minor or not directly related. But since tweet 4 is about future earnings and a potential increase in profits, which is a significant factor, and others reinforce this trend, it seems the sentiment is mostly positive."
2014-02-27,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for a company. The user provided five tweets, but I don't see any specific stock symbol mentioned. Hmm, that might be a problem because I need to know which stock to focus on. Maybe it's one of the most commonly analyzed stocks? Or perhaps all of them are for different companies? Wait, in the output example, they used ""gigabyte"" as an example. Maybe each tweet is about a different company, and I have to analyze each one individually.

Let me go through each tweet one by one.

First tweet: ""rt AT_USER google ara will make phones in bits ~ itbw for AT_USER $ goog ~ ~ ~ URL."" Hmm, this seems like some kind of link or message. The user is saying they're going to Google something related to making phones in bits, probably a tech-related product. But without knowing if Google has been involved before, I can't say much about the stock impact. It's vague.

Second tweet: ""google inc : patent issued for moving a graphical selector URL $ goog."" This looks like a news article mentioning a company getting a patent. Patents usually come with long lifespans, so they might not affect stock price much unless it's a critical innovation. Maybe neutral because it's about a new invention.

Third tweet: ""$ goog 1230 today would be swell . !"" It seems like the user is saying $ Google is expected to go up to $1230. That sounds very positive, so probably [Positive].

Fourth tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ aapl now down almost 8 % so far in 2014 . $ msft flat . $ goog + 9 % . $ bbry + 39 % ."" This is talking about stock performance of Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), and Baidu (BBRY). They are all tech companies. The user is saying that in 2014, they were down for a while, but their current prices are up by 9% and 39%. That's very strong news for tech stocks. It could be [Positive].

Fifth tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ aapl now down almost 8 % so far in 2014 . $ msft flat . $ goog + 9 % . $ bbry + 39 % ."" Wait, this looks identical to the fourth tweet. So both are saying that ABL has been down for a while but is up now. That might be a typo or duplication because in reality, stock prices go up and down over time. But since it's consistent, maybe it's just the same information being repeated.

So putting it all together: The first tweet is vague about Google, second about a patent, third is positive news for Google, fourth and fifth are tech stocks that have seen some gains but were down before. So overall, there seems to be mixed sentiment with some positive and negative points.

Wait, I'm not sure if the user intended each tweet to be about a different stock or just general news about tech companies. If they're all about tech companies, then their impact could vary more widely. But without knowing the exact stocks, it's hard to say for sure. Maybe the best approach is to assume that these tweets are all about the same company, but I think each one refers to a different entity.

Wait, let me check again: The fourth and fifth tweets both mention AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, BBRY. So probably four different stocks. So in that case, some positive news (GOOGLE up 9%), others negative (AAPL down). But without specific context, it's hard to assess the impact.

Alternatively, if each tweet is about a separate stock, then their impacts would vary based on specific events. For example, Apple might be affected by earnings calls, while Google could be due to beta testing or new features.

But since I don't have the target stock symbol, I can't give an exact sentiment. Maybe in the output, it just needs me to say [Neutral], as the first tweet is too vague. But I'm not entirely sure because each tweet has different themes but might collectively influence the market."
2014-02-28,Positive,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a set of tweets related to a company and needs me to determine their likely impact on the stock price using a score of [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, I need to figure out which tweet is the target stock symbol. Looking through the list, the only obvious one is ""goog"", which appears in multiple tweets. So, my target stock is Google.

Next, I'll go through each tweet to identify the factors and assess sentiment.

1. **Tweet 1**: ""$ goog next 10 days URL"" - This seems like a positive sign about Google's future and suggests they are going for the $ sign. It could be indicating support or interest in purchasing, so this is definitely positive.

2. **Tweet 2**: ""rt AT_USER google's plan for your body and its stock split URL $ ssys $ goog google apple $ aapl 3dp 3dprinting"" - The mention of Google's future (split) seems positive, as it implies potential growth or interest. Also, the words like ""apple"" might indicate related concerns but not necessarily negative here.

3. **Tweet 3**: ""rt AT_USER ' this bubble is real ... some of the biggest offenders ? $ fb , $ amzn , $ nflx , $ tsla , $ goog ! "" - The mention of specific stocks like Facebook, Amazon, Tesla, and Google seems positive. It's pointing out that these companies are not part of a larger trend but rather distinct entities, which might suggest diversification or cautious optimism.

4. **Tweet 4**: ""$ s & p 500 : is this a buying opportunity ? URL $ aapl , $ aep , $ cat , $ dd , $ fb , $ ge , $ goog , $ gs , $ mmm , $ nflx , $ pfe"" - This tweet is about the S&P 500, asking if it's a buying opportunity. It doesn't directly mention Google but lists several companies. While there are many names mentioned (like Apple, Tesla), the focus seems to be on evaluating stocks that include Google. The wording is neutral because it's an evaluation of multiple stocks and not expressing a clear positive or negative opinion.

5. **Tweet 5**: ""myec is up 1,278 % for our subscribers , in the past month ! subscribe here : URL $ amzn $ mcox $ goog"" - This seems like a promotion for Amazon's stock, which might be positive if the user believes in investing. However, it's more of a sales pitch rather than an analysis.

6. **Tweet 6**: ""$ goog - controlling with the wave of a hand : gesture-recognition specs at mwc -> URL stock stocks stockaction"" - The mention of Google's future as ""wave of a hand"" is ambiguous but could be seen as optimistic, indicating potential growth or interest.

7. **Tweet 7**: ""$ goog samsung and PayPal are about to show apple how it's done URL"" - This tweet suggests that Google will adopt something like Apple in the future. It might indicate continued innovation but doesn't necessarily push the stock price up.

8. **Tweet 8**: ""$ pdm thinking of investing in $ cli $ srcl $ goog wealthmanagement"" - The mention of investment-related terms and keywords could imply diversification or potential for growth, leaning towards positive sentiment.

9. **Tweet 9**: ""google inc : international fan-centric festival in mumbai this weekend URL $ goog"" - This tweet is a bit vague, but the inclusion of Google's stock symbol suggests interest from investors. It might indicate optimism about the company's performance during a major event.

10. **Tweet 10**: ""commented on stocktwits : $ goog ? URL"" - This seems like a comment or post expressing interest in Google stock on stocktwits, which could be a mix of positive and neutral as it reflects user sentiment around the stock.

11. **Tweet 11**: ""great stock research $ omc $ wec $ wcrx $ goog personalfinance URL"" - This tweet is vague but mentions Google, suggesting ongoing interest or investment in the company's stock. It might be seen as positive if it reflects genuine interest.

Now, summarizing the analysis:
- Tweets 1, 2, and 3 are clearly positive.
- Tweets 4 and 7 are neutral because they involve a broader evaluation of multiple stocks without a specific direction on Google.
- Tweets 5, 8, 9, 10, and 11 are slightly positive but include varied opinions that could be seen as neutral.

Considering the majority of tweets lean towards positive sentiment with some neutral elements, I think it leans more positive overall. However, since there are several neutral points and some negative hints in tweet 3 about potential growth (though it's ambiguous), it's a bit tricky. But leaning more to positive because all positive tweets outweigh the neutral ones."
2014-03-01,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of a company. So, the user has provided 7 tweets and they want me to determine if each is positive, neutral, or negative. Then I need to sum it up into one overall sentiment.

First, I'll start by looking at each tweet individually. 

1. The first tweet mentions that Google's target $aep (Apple's share price) has been falling towards the US dollar, specifically targeting 100 dollars. It also talks about the government pushing companies to robotics via a food modernization act. Hmm, Apple is involved here. I know Apple is a big company and this could impact their stock.

2. The second tweet says Google gained 7% over the last month. This is clearly positive news for the company, which would likely boost their stock price.

3. The third tweet suggests that Google is piecing together a smartphone revolution. That definitely sounds like a positive trend because a smartphone-related innovation could drive growth and be favorable to investors.

4. The fourth tweet mentions stocks to watch, including $sti (TSMC), $AEP (Apple), and $TTC (Target Corp). These are all tech companies. But without specific information on TSMC's performance, it's hard to say for sure if this is positive or negative.

5. The fifth tweet talks about a chart by Flash Meditation. That seems like an unrelated topic. It might be misleading or irrelevant, so I'll consider it neutral since it doesn't directly relate to the stock being discussed.

6. The sixth tweet mentions platinum memberships rising after gains on penny stocks in 2 months. Platinum memberships could affect e-commerce sales, which is a broader market factor. It's not specific enough for tech stocks, so I'll treat this as neutral because it's too speculative or unrelated.

7. The seventh tweet shares that Google CEO Tim Cook is teasing about the company's upcoming products, specifically targeting shareholders. This kind of wordplay can create buzz and boost stock prices, especially if it leads to positive expectations.

Now, combining these thoughts: 

- Tweets 2 and 3 are strong positive indicators for Google, which would likely make them a high weight in the overall sentiment.
- Tweet 4 is speculative but could be positive or neutral depending on TSMC's performance. I'll assume it's neutral since no specific info is given.
- Tweets 1, 5, and 6 don't seem to directly relate to Google's stock.Tweet 7 has a bit of wordplay which might be positive.

But wait, tweet 4 says ""overvalued,"" which suggests the stock may be higher than its intrinsic value. That could indicate some concerns, but without more info, it's hard to say definitively. Maybe neutral because other factors are at play.

So putting it all together: tweets 2 (positive), 3 (positive), and 7 (positive) contribute heavily, while 1,4,5,6 have mixed signals. But I'm not sure if the mixed ones outweigh the positive ones. It might still lean towards positive but a bit uncertain."
2014-03-02,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of a company. So, first, I need to look at each tweet and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.

Starting with tweet 1: ""bearish on these stocks ma $ see $ tex $ goog goto URL"". Hmm, this seems like a negative statement about other companies. It mentions ""bearish"" which suggests concern or skepticism. But I'm not sure how strong that is. It could be affecting investor sentiment towards certain stocks.

Tweet 2: ""rt AT_USER rt AT_USER why does google want to become an isp ? URL $ goog"". The user is asking a question about Google wanting to become an ISP, but there's no direct information on whether that's positive or negative. It might not have much impact unless it leads to media attention or investor interest.

Tweet 3: ""thinking of investing in $ goog $ orly $ val $ ir view now URL"". This seems like a statement about possible investments. Investors might be influenced by this, but without specific info on what they're interested in, it's hard to gauge the sentiment. It could push some investors but not sure if it's overall positive, negative, or neutral.

Tweet 4: ""missed recent articles on $ goog , $ fb , $ cmi , $ ggg , $ fls , $ beat , $ nspr ? check them out on URL"". The user is asking about missed articles and suggesting they check others. It seems like a general request for info but doesn't express positive or negative feelings towards the stock itself.

Tweet 5: ""AT_USER $ aapl $ bbry $ goog joke of the week , they should run the space station with ios 7 . hahahahahahahaha"". This tweet uses humor about Google's product update. Humor can sometimes be seen as neutral because it doesn't relate directly to the stock performance, but it might lighten the mood or attract more attention.

Tweet 6: ""why does google want to become an isp ? URL $ goog"". Again, a question about Google wanting to be an ISP. Similar to tweet 2, no direct information on sentiment unless there's implied positive or negative cues, which I don't see here.

So putting it all together, most tweets are either reporting concerns (tweets 1 and 6) or asking for info without positive/negative indicators (tweets 4-5). Tweets that seem to hint at possible investment thoughts but not specific to the stock sentiment. Given this, the overall impact is likely neutral because while there's some negative language, the information doesn't strongly support a positive or negative opinion about the company."
2014-03-03,Positive,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the likely impact on the future stock price of the company based on these tweets. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet says ""will google fiber unseat big telecom?"" Hmm, that sounds like a negative signal because fiber is known for being great in telecom, so maybe the company isn't doing well there.
2. The second tweet mentions free research on various stocks but doesn't specify which ones. It's vague and could be positive or negative depending on what's researched. But without more context, it's hard to tell.
3. The third tweet talks about integrating Apple with Google maps. That seems like a positive sign for the company because integration can often lead to better products. However, the fact that it looks as if the wait is over might be confusing and could imply that there are no negatives left.
4. The fourth tweet mentions getting more info on NIX, XOM, CLWR, and GOOG. Again, without specifics, this is speculative.
5. The fifth tweet says ADEP is bullish and expecting a reversal today. That's a strong positive because a bullish indicator can boost stock prices.
6. The sixth tweet suggests GOOG wants to be VOUGO in YAHOO, but the user clarified it's ""fat chance."" Vougo isn't a known company, so this might not hold any negative significance.
7. The seventh tweet is about bearish news on these stocks, which sounds serious and could indicate potential for a downturn.
8. The eighth tweet talks about researching the best penny stock. Penny stocks are often seen as undervalued, which can be positive.
9. The ninth tweet mentions Apple's iPhone becoming more compatible with cars. This could lead to better product sales or market presence, adding to the company's success.
10. The tenth tweet suggests that the sale of LED lights is popular among spammers, implying demand in a competitive market might not be there. That could cause a temporary drop but possibly recover over time.
11. The eleventh tweet mentions thinking about investing in FEB and ACC stocks. Investing can be volatile and depends on personal goals, making it hard to assess sentiment.
12. The twelfth tweet is about watching a stock watchlist, suggesting the company has some focus, which could indicate positive activity but might not directly impact price unless there are specific issues.
13. The thirteenth tweet suggests trying out VOA and IGXP stocks as winners. Like the previous one, this could be speculative.

Now, putting it all together: Positive tweets include number 5 (bullish), number 9 (compatible cars), and number 8 (penny stock). There's a negative hint from number 7. The other positive tweets are mixed but overall the positives seem to outweigh negatives. So the overall sentiment is likely positive."
2014-03-04,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of Google. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Let's look at the first tweet: ""$ goog right back over hat $ 1,215 ... $ tsla up on news ( not shocking after yday action ) and $ spy right back to $ 187 haha ... im dying here"". Hmm, it mentions Google ($goog) and Tesla (tsla), so that's the target stock for both.

Looking at tweet number 2: ""$ goog - e-commerce stock update - march 2014 ( pt . 1 ) - zacks analyst interviews URL"". This also mentions Google, so I'll consider that as the target.

Tweets 3 and 4 are about the company ""rt AT_USER is roku david or goliath against apple & amazon ? URL $ aapl $ amzn $ goog $ ntgr roku AT_USER"". It seems like they're discussing whether Microsoft (auburn) or NVIDIA (ntgr) will be better than Apple and Amazon, which doesn't directly relate to Google.

Finally, tweet number 5 talks about comparing the Chromebook of Google with Windows, Mac, and Android. This is unrelated because the target stock here is Google itself, not another company like Microsoft or NVIDIA.

So, out of five tweets, only the first three are relevant to Google. But some don't provide enough information to assess sentiment. The third tweet mentions ""robo"" and asks about their position against Apple & Amazon, which I can assume means Microsoft or NVIDIA. 

Given that the other two tweets (1 and 2) mention Google, but only the second one talks about Tesla, it might be more relevant for assessing Google's stock. However, without specific details from these tweets, it's hard to determine if they're positive or negative.

Since I don't have enough context to evaluate each tweet's sentiment accurately, maybe I should consider each as neutral. Each is discussing something else unrelated to Google, so the impact might be neutral."
2014-03-05,Negative,"Alright, let's try to analyze these tweets and figure out their impact on the stock price of the company. First, I'll identify the target stock from the tweets. All the tweets mention $ goog, so I think the target stock is Google.

Now, looking at each tweet one by one:

1. The first tweet talks about a new economy focusing on ""AT_USER,"" which seems like a typo for ""user."" It mentions that Google's market cap has surpassed that of Yahoo. That's positive because it suggests the company is expanding in a way that could boost its share value.

2. The second tweet deletes Google from their search engine list and blocks social media URLs. This action directly affects users, which can lead to decreased investor confidence as more people might switch to other platforms. That's negative sentiment.

3. The third tweet removes access to services linked with Facebook and Google, specifically URL-related actions on Google stocks and actions for stock stocks stockaction. This could make the company seem less accessible or integrated into social media platforms, which is a downward trend.

4. The fourth tweet mentions Google capital investing in URL URLs related to Facebook. While this shows they're looking towards expanding their digital presence, it's not directly linked to the stock price. Still, there's some positive information about their future investments.

5. The fifth tweet details a year-long situation where Apple outspent Google on acquisitions, but asks about in-house innovation. This seems like a neutral point since while Apple has done well, the context is vague and doesn't show immediate impact on Google.

6. The sixth tweet suggests that blocking Facebook access could grant users access to Google's user data. This would definitely affect investor sentiment by reducing their options, which is a negative signal.

7. The seventh tweet talks about investing in GCI, NSR, CHH, andgoog URLs. This again relates to potential expansion or investment strategies but doesn't provide concrete information on the stock price yet.

8. The eighth tweet discusses the undervaluation of Russian Google due to various indices and currencies. If the company's shares are seen as undervalued, that could indicate investor expectations, which is positive if they think it will go up in value.

9. The ninth tweet mentions insider trading news on LUV, DFS,goog, and Singedi stocks. Insider trading typically raises concern about financial stability and can lead to negative sentiment, making investors doubt the stock's future performance.

10. The tenth tweet talks about a user-updated stock price with a 450% increase in Tesla. While this is positive for the company, it's just one tweet; other tweets might provide more context or contradicting info.

11. The eleventh tweet is another update about the same user, reinforcing the same positive trend as tweet ten but again only providing one data point.

Putting it all together: Most tweets are positive with some negative ones like the second and sixth. Some speculative tweets are neutral but mostly show confidence in expanding or having strong fundamentals. However, there's a significant negative impact from blocking access to platforms that users would otherwise use for accessing Google's services. This reduced user engagement could decrease demand, which is a negative signal.

So overall, the sentiment seems mixed with some positive and some negative elements, leaning more towards Negative."
2014-03-06,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets about the stock price of a company and determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually.

First tweet: ""$ goog whatsapp ? google executive disses facebook deal URL"". Hmm, not sure what this means. It seems like some words are misspelled or unclear, so I can't do much with it.

Second tweet is a bit confusing because of the quotes and "" illustrates why investors should love google inc."" but the URLs are inconsistent. Maybe it's just part of another tweet that got cut off.

Third tweet: ""$ goog received a new alert . find out why at URL stocks markets daytrading trading mkt nyse nasdaq 526"". This seems like a news announcement about an alert getting sent, which could indicate positive or negative sentiment. But the context isn't clear without more information.

Fourth tweet mentions a video on YouTube about Google Barge moving to stockton. It's a tech-related update, but not directly related to the stock price. Maybe some investors are interested in Google's product development, so it might be neutral.

Fifth tweet: ""$ goog google : facebook overpaid for whatsapp ; mobile use will bring more revenue than pcs URL"". This seems like a financial statement comparing Facebook's costs with WhatsApp's profits and talking about mobile revenue. It's discussing business strategies but doesn't mention the stock price or market reactions, so it might be neutral.

Sixth tweet talks about ""watching it closely"", mentions several stocks, including goog, glco, pfe, altr, blox, goto. It seems like a general update about the market, not specific to any particular stock. Without more context, it's hard to gauge sentiment, so maybe it's neutral.

Seventh tweet: ""$ goog has destroyed $ msft business model URL via AT_USER"". This suggests that Google has messed up their partnership with Microsoft, which could have significant implications for both companies. If it affects investor confidence, it might be negative.

Eighth tweet: ""$ google opera's android browser catches up to rivals with support for webpage video chats URL"". Similar to the previous one, it's about a tech update regarding Google's Android product. Not directly related to stock price unless there's something about their performance or adoption. Probably neutral without more info.

Ninth tweet is about ""thinking of investing in pfe, altr, goog, blox, goto URL"". Another announcement about investments, but not specifically mentioning the stock. It might indicate investor interest, so maybe positive.

Tenth tweet discusses P/E ratio with both Facebook and Google's financial metrics. The user mentions PE is 112, which I think is a low number indicating high valuation. But without context on how this affects the stock price, it's hard to say if it's positive or negative for the company.

Putting all together: I have some tweets that are talking about market trends and tech news but no specific direction on whether the stock should go up or down. The most concerning ones are the seventh tweet where Google's partnership with Microsoft could be bad news, and the tenth which talks about P/E ratio being low. So overall, it seems like there's some negative sentiment due to these factors."
2014-03-07,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out the user's query. They've provided a set of tweets and asked for an analysis of their likely impact on a company's stock price. The possible outcomes are [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, I need to break down each tweet one by one. I'll extract the target stock symbol from each. Looking at the first tweet: ""best stock newsletter on $ sfg $ pnra $ lgf $ goog give it a try URL"". The stock symbols here are $ sfg, $ pnra, and $ lgf. But without knowing which one is the target, it's hard to assess. Maybe I'll assume it's related to Google since $ goog appears frequently. 

The second tweet mentions ""gainesville company part of google's 3-d initiative uf $ goog tech jacksonville URL"". Again, the target symbol here could be Google or UF. Third tweet talks about Google stock selling Tesla: ""rt AT_USER $ goog why google should consider buying tesla : why google should consider buying tesla valuewalk - 1 hour ago ... http …"", so maybe that's referring to another company, possibly Tesla.

Fourth tweet says stocks are bullish on $ mwv and others. The symbols here are $ mwv and $ tso. I'm not sure about these symbols, but they might be in the tech sector or a different industry.

Fifth tweet: ""buy or sell ? $ mck $ fnfg $ vntv $ goog goto URL"". This looks like multiple stocks labeled for buy or sell, with Google included.

Sixth tweet: ""stocks to hold onto $ tex $ hal $ fsl $ goog stock URL"". The target here could be Google again, since $ goog is present. Maybe a different company elsewhere.

Seventh tweet: ""google inc : ap technology newsbrief at 7:35 p . m . est URL"". This seems like Google-related news about their technology developments.

Now, I need to assess each tweet's impact on the stock. The seventh tweet mentions Google's news and could influence investor sentiment positively if it highlights growth or positive developments. But without knowing which symbol is the target, it's tricky. For example, if ""sfg"" is a known tech stock, positive news might boost it.

The first tweet is vague, but including $ goog makes me think about market reactions to Google moves. If the newsletter encourages investors to try Google, that could increase demand and push the price up.

Second tweet mentions UF, which I'm unsure of, but if UF's stocks are bullish on Google, that might be a positive sign for Google.

Third tweet suggests Google should buy Tesla, which is a tech company. That's a negative signal because buying another company can sometimes be seen as a risk or speculative move. But it could still push the overall stock price positively.

Fourth tweet about $ mwv and $ tso, maybe these are different tech stocks that the user is considering buying. If they're in a good position, it might have positive effects.

Fifth tweet says to buy or sell on those stocks. If it's an opportunity, positive news could push the stock up. But if selling, it might lower the price.

Sixth tweet about $ tex and others. If these companies are being held from uncertainty, negative sentiment could come into play.

Seventh tweet is about Google's news at a specific time. If it's about new developments or technology that boosts expectations for Google's stock, that would be positive.

Putting this together, I think each tweet contributes to a mixed outlook. Positive tweets increase investor confidence, neutral if they don't directly touch the target stock, and negative if there are speculative moves without clear direction. However, with multiple positive statements about Google and potential positive developments elsewhere, it leans towards a positive overall sentiment."
2014-03-08,Neutral,"Alright, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a given company. Let's break down each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock from both tweets. The first tweet is about Google Inc., focusing on their expansion in Alameda County, which seems like business expansion could positively impact their revenue and market presence. The second tweet mentions Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Apple employees talking about common interests, then lists the stocks as $ goog (Google), $ fb ($ Facebook), and $ aapl ($ Apple). This suggests that these companies might be related to the company being analyzed.

Now, for each tweet, I need to identify positive and negative factors. In the first tweet, ""Expand into 127,000 square feet in Alameda URL $ goog"" – this is definitely a positive factor. The expansion would likely increase their market reach and possibly revenue. However, since it's Google, which has a significant market presence, but I'm not sure if that's a strong enough factor to outweigh other elements.

In the second tweet, ""what do Facebook , Twitter , Google , and Apple employees have in common ? $ goog $ twtr $ fb $ aapl rt AT_USER"" – this seems more like a promotional or informational tweet. It doesn't mention any positive or negative factors directly but is likely meant to attract投资者 interest.

Next, assessing the sentiment from each tweet: The first tweet clearly states ""URL $ goog,"" which is positive as it's an increase in price. The second tweet is more about discussion and not explicitly stating a sentiment towards stock prices. It includes Twitter symbols, so maybe that's just for engagement rather than influencing investor sentiment.

Combining these analyses, the main positive factor comes from the Google expansion, but since it's a specific business-related term, it might be overshadowed by broader market trends or lack of specific details about other factors like interest rates or company performance. The overall impact seems neutral because while there's a clear positive point due to expansion, the rest is just promotional without concrete info on sentiment."
2014-03-09,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and figure out their impact on Amazon's stock price in the future. Let me start by reading through each tweet carefully.

First tweet: ""after 2,600 % gains , a new penny stock alert's coming and you can get it first ! major news : URL $ amzn $ mcox $ goog""

Hmm, the key here is that there are percentage gains mentioned (2,600%). The word ""new"" suggests that this might be a new stock or an upcoming launch. A 2,600% gain seems like a significant jump. Then it says ""you can get it first ! major news : URL $ amzn $ mcox $ goog"". So maybe someone is pushing for Amazon to go public via these URLs.

But wait, the user didn't specify if this is about Amazon's stock or another company. The tweets are focusing on AMZN and MKCO, which are both companies, but they're just part of the URL mentioned. I should consider that perhaps it's a typo and meant to mention something related to AMZN only.

Second tweet: ""$ sats todays movers to research $ wll $ vtr $ goog personalfinance URL""

This one is more about Sats, which are a type of cryptocurrency known for their scarcity, and some other companies like WLL (which I think stands for Apple Inc.), VTR, and others. The phrase ""movers to research"" suggests that these companies might be on the rise in the market, especially as something moves up. The mention of personalfinance also seems a bit odd but could imply an upcoming event or product.

Now, considering both tweets together: the first one is signaling an imminent release of AMZN, which would be a positive because it's a major stock for many investors. The second tweet is about Sats and other companies that might have a lot of interest from people looking to ""mover"" into certain sectors or products.

So combining these, both tweets are positive signs about upcoming events related to companies that could benefit significantly from the stock market changes. Positive factors here would likely make me think about how this could boost Amazon's future performance. But I'm not sure if it directly affects AMZN but might have indirect effects on the broader market. 

I don't see any negative or neutral signs in either tweet, so overall sentiment is positive. Thus, the stock price of Amazon is expected to be [Positive]."
2014-03-10,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of Google. I'm not an expert, but I'll do my best based on what's given.

First, each tweet seems to be about changes in Google's performance or related news. Let me go through them one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions triple-digit returns from a webinar URL and talks about stock prices. That sounds positive because it points towards strong returns.
2. Second tweet is about investor movement on the stocks index, which might indicate interest or sentiment changes that could affect prices.
3. Third tweet talks about improving car-buying process with tech integration. This seems like a positive sign for potential growth in Google's business model.
4. Fourth tweet mentions big news about penny stocks and gains from 2,600%. That sounds very positive for Google.
5. Fifth tweet is about AT_USER signaling Tim Cook getting involved in Apple's top stock. This could be a bit confusing because it's not directly related to Google. Maybe it's just a typo or some sort of side note that's not relevant to Google's performance.
6. Sixth tweet is with Roger McNamee discussing Bitcoin and other stocks, possibly mentioning Google indirectly. Not sure about the impact here, but possible positive if Bitcoin gains.
7. Seventh tweet criticizes NFL teams and prolines in the stock market. That seems negative because it contradicts Google's positive news.
8. Eighth tweet talks about multiple stocks being watched for wealth management. This is unrelated to Google, so probably not impacting the price much.
9. Ninth tweet mentions Google focusing on clean-energy investments. While this could be good for long-term growth, it might not directly impact the short-term stock price unless there's a push from investors expecting more clean energy investment.

Now, considering all these points. Positive tweets are 1, 4, and 5 (even though 5 is a bit confusing). Neutral would include 3 and 7 because they're about car buying and financial companies that might not be directly Google's. Negative includes tweet 7. 

So overall sentiment seems positive from the positive tweets outweighing the neutral ones, but there are some negative comments. However, without significant headwinds or conflicting signals, it leans slightly positive.

Wait, let me check again. The third tweet is about a car-buying process, which could indicate increased demand for Google's products, contributing to higher stock price. Fourth tweet mentions penny stocks going up, which is good for investors. Fifth tweet was unclear but maybe not relevant. So positives are strong, negatives are minor.

So I'll go with Positive overall."
2014-03-11,Negative,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. The user provided some tweets and wants me to assess each one step by step.

First, I'll look at the target stock symbol from the tweets. In tweet 1, it's ""goog"", so that's Google. Now, looking through all the tweets, each one is about different aspects related to Google. Some are positive, others are negative, and a few seem neutral in content but might affect investor sentiment.

Starting with tweet 1: It says $ goog - why google could follow apple down. This seems like it might be pushing some investors away because they expect Google's performance relative to Apple to decline. That could lead to concern about the market's balance, which might influence stock prices.

Tweet 2 mentions stock market reports on Google and others. These are general news about the company's performance, which is usually neutral in terms of sentiment for short-term price changes but can affect broader market views.

Tweet 3 talks about finding more winners like Google, which could imply that Google is doing well enough to gain investor confidence. This would likely be a positive signal.

Tweet 4 is about recent news on Wall Street related to Google's investments. If the context suggests that Google is doing something positive, that could boost its stock price.

Tweets 5-10 are more detailed but seem to provide specific info or predictions without strong sentiment cues. For example, tweet 5 asks whether to buy stocks in a specific company based on tech trends. This could be neutral because it's just advice without predicting up or down.

Tweet 6 is about Google facing a lawsuit involving kids' purchases. That seems like something investors would be concerned about—if there are lawsuits affecting revenue, it could lead to negative sentiment.

Tweets 7 and 8 mention upcoming stock picks. If these are from tech firms that might benefit from Google's performance, they might influence investor confidence positively.

Tweets 9-15 discuss the stock market recap for Apple and others. This is a general view of the market, which doesn't provide direct information about Google, so it could be neutral or even negative if the market is down.

Putting it all together, tweets from users like NEP, ATT, and TCK are likely to influence investor sentiment, especially on Google since they're actively discussing Google's position. Positive tweets can create buzz and increase demand, while negative ones might decrease it. However, the overall impact seems positive because these tweets are providing direct information that could be seen as a signal for investors.

So, considering all this, I think the overall sentiment is likely [Positive] because the information given by users directly affects Google's stock in specific ways."
2014-03-12,Negative,"Alright, I'm going to analyze these tweets to determine their likely impact on the stock price of TSLA (Tangentsoft Limited). Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. **Tweet 1**: The company's search results are updated with a new URL that includes increased font size and a new experiment. This seems like positive news, possibly increasing investor confidence in their products or services.
2. **Tweet 2**: It mentions that Google brings ""good fortune"" to credit karma, which is a term I'm not familiar with. This could mean they're giving good advice or support, which might be seen as positive.
3. **Tweet 3**: Only active users are mentioned, suggesting that it's from professionals. The sentence seems negative about pricing being overpriced by 78.5 points.
4. **Tweet 4**: It refers to markets being in a bubble state with several tech stocks. This is a significant concern as it suggests a potential trend downward.
5. **Tweet 5**: They mention a hft algorithm selling 14:26 FV at a price of $232, targeting 227 stocks. Positive news about selling high volume to increase profits.
6. **Tweet 6**: Platinum memberships are rising due to 2,600% gains on penny stocks over two months. This could indicate good news for customers or services.
7. **Tweet 7**: A research firm on a pennystock (possibly a company segment) mentions Google as part of their checklist. This might suggest they're evaluating services provided by Google and could be positive if the services are good.
8. **Tweet 8**: An ETF named RBOB tops $100 million in assets. While not a direct news, it's a significant amount which could indicate potential growth or investment interest.
9. **Tweet 9**: They discuss price commentary from spy (I think this is Google) on TSLA stock. Positive comments about the company's actions might be seen as good for investors.
10. **Tweet 10**: Google's business group and software houses are associating to bring women to Pakistan. This could imply that they're promoting gender equality or technology, which might attract a positive audience.

Now, combining all these factors: several tweets mention positive developments like increased font size (Tweet 1), good news for credit karma (Tweet 2), selling stocks (Tweets 5 and 9), and potential interest from women in tech (Tweet 10). However, some tweets also indicate concerns about overpriced assets (Tweet 3) or a bubble state (Tweet 4), which could be negative. The overall sentiment seems mixed because there are conflicting positive and negative aspects.

Considering all the information together, the stock is likely to be affected in a way that might not favor one outcome alone but rather depends on the interplay of these factors. It's probable that while some tweets are positive, others suggest potential risks or issues. This makes it challenging to determine a clear overall sentiment without more context."
2014-03-13,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze the given tweets to determine their likely impact on the stock price of the company in question. The task is similar to what was described earlier, where each tweet provides information about the company or its operations.

First, let me identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking through the tweets, none seem to specify a particular stock symbol. That's confusing. Maybe I need to figure out which stock these tweets are referring to based on common patterns in financial news.

Looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER details on google's rumored retail store $ goog URL"". This seems like it could be referring to Google, as AT_USER is a Twitter user account for Google. So I'll focus on the stock related to Google.

Now, let me go through each tweet one by one and break them down into factors and assess their impact.

1. **""rt AT_USER details on google's rumored retail store $ goog URL""**
   - **Positive factor:** Google's reported retail store is being highlighted.
   - **Negative factor:** No mention of any negative implications, just positive information.
   - **Assessment:** Positive because there's new info about the company.

2. **"" $ goog [ video ] google searches for first nyc retail location URL""**
   - **Positive factor:** Google has a video showing its search for the first NYC retail location.
   - **Negative factor:** This is more of an update on Google's efforts rather than a negative impact directly on the stock price.
   - **Assessment:** Not explicitly negative, so it might be considered neutral.

3. **""AT_USER rt $ aapl hft algo triggered sell @ 10:01 p / t 535 stocks $ pcln $ bidu $ nflx $ twtr $ fb $ goog $ amzn $ tsla $ qqq""**
   - **Positive factor:** An APPL (Apple) hft (high-frequency trading) algorithm triggers a sell order at 10:01 p.m. This could affect the stock's price, but it's speculative.
   - **Negative factor:** The tweet mentions multiple stocks are selling, which might indicate buyer interest or sentiment changes.
   - **Assessment:** It's a mix of positive (triggers) and negative (multiple sells), so overall ambiguous.

4. **""facebook : mini-aircraft are ready to launch URL $ fb , $ goog""**
   - **Positive factor:** Facebook is advancing their mini-aircraft project, which could boost earnings.
   - **Negative factor:** No direct impact on the stock price mentioned here.
   - **Assessment:** Some positive info about Facebook's projects.

5. **""facebook : mini-aircrafts are ready to launch URL $ goog google $ fb""**
   - This seems like a repeat of tweet 4, providing more context that Facebook is moving forward with their project.
   - **Positive factor:** More details about Facebook's project, which might influence the stock price.
   - **Negative factor:** Again, no direct negative impact on the stock.
   - **Assessment:** Still positive info.

6. **""$ goog - navigate the colorado river from your sofa with google maps street vie ... -> URL stock stocks stockaction""**
   - **Positive factor:** Google is offering a way to navigate the Colorado River using Google Maps and Street View.
   - **Negative factor:** This might be seen as innovative or tech-related, which could have positive or negative impacts on the stock price. It's unclear without more context.
   - **Assessment:** The tweet is vague but might lean towards positive sentiment due to the use of technology.

7. **""$ goog google likely to enter set-top box industry with green throttle games acquisition URL""**
   - **Positive factor:** Google plans to enter a set-top box industry, which could be a significant market segment.
   - **Negative factor:** No direct negative impact mentioned here.
   - **Assessment:** Positive news about Google's expansion into a new industry.

8. **""$ goog google likely to enter set-top box industry with green throttle games acquisition URL""**
   - This is similar to tweet 7; it repeats the same information.
   - **Positive factor:** Same positive impact as in tweet 7.
   - **Assessment:** Still strong positive sentiment.

9. **""its breaktout time on $ slgn $ egn $ apd $ goog must see URL""**
   - **Positive factor:** There's a mention of the bus stop becoming open, which could indicate customer interest or positive news about Google.
   - **Negative factor:** No direct negative impact mentioned here.
   - **Assessment:** Positive, as it's likely related to potential customers.

Now, summarizing all these factors:

- The tweet identifies Google and mentions various projects and initiatives that could positively affect the stock price due to Google's growth in areas like retail, tech, and potentially even entertainment. Facebook's project is also noted.
- The other tweets are either providing information about specific news events or minor updates on Google's activities.

Overall sentiment seems positive because multiple tweets highlight Google's expansion into different sectors, which can positively influence investor confidence and expectations for future performance. However, some tweets focus more on Facebook, but the overall focus remains on Google's capabilities and potential growth opportunities."
2014-03-14,Neutral,"Okay, let's try to figure out how to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company based on the given information. The task is to determine whether each tweet contributes positively, neutrally, or negatively to the stock's expected performance.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet, it mentions ""goog the morning download : why ' you've got mail ' still means something URL."" It seems like this is related to Google's stock. So, the target stock here is likely Google (GOOG).

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate them into positive and negative factors. Let me go through each one step by step.

1. "" $ goog the morning download : why ' you've got mail ' still means something URL"" – This seems like it's talking about Google's stock performance. It might be giving an update or information related to Google, so that could be a positive factor.
2. ""$ fast small-cap stocks setting new 52 - wk high prices $ o $ msi $ goog personalfinance URL"" – This tweet is discussing the price of small-cap stocks and seems to mention ""personalfinance."" It might be about market sentiment or interest in financial products, which could impact stock valuations.
3. ""$ wow . great stock research on $ pru $ dds $ drc $ goog money URL"" – This mentions Google's stock prices and possibly some currencies ($pru and $drc), but it seems to be discussing investment strategies or market analysis related to Google. It might contribute positively as it's looking into their financials.
4. ""todays movers to research $ mbi $ btu $ fult $ goog financial URL"" – This is about researching Google's financial performance, which could be positive for investors interested in the company's profitability.
5. ""$ goog affordable asus chromebox cloud pc fires shot across Microsoft's bow URL"" – This tweet talks about Google's PC issues affecting Microsoft and mentions a Chrome box. It might be related to market competition or stock price movements between tech giants. If this negatively affects Google's performance, it could be negative for the company.
6. ""about $ goog & nasa — ( 1 ) URL and ( 2 ) URL google fuel nasa - via AT_USER"" – This is about Google's relationship with NASA and mentions a user. It might be discussing partnerships or public relations, which can impact investor sentiment positively if it enhances understanding of the company.
7. ""$ goog protect the open web and the promise of the digital age URL"" – This tweet emphasizes Google's work on the internet (open web) and the potential for the digital future. Positive statements about technology can boost investor confidence and stock performance.
8. ""rt AT_USER pandora loses a third of its users in a year URL $ aapl apple $ goog $ amzn $ p"" – This mentions an increase in competitors losing users, specifically on Pandora. It could be negative if it affects Google's sales or market share negatively.
9. ""rt AT_USER fedcir reverses $ goog summary judgment win over patents aimed at street view due to claim construction errors : URL"" – This suggests that the stock's summary judgment was reversed based on patent claims from construction errors. Positive if it changes investor views, possibly benefiting the stock positively.
10. ""$ goog - chromecast android app prepped for upcoming international rollout -> URL stock stocks stockaction"" – This is about preparing an Android app for a future roll-out related to Google's services. It might not directly impact Google's performance but could indirectly affect competitors or investor perceptions.

Now, summarizing each tweet's sentiment:

1. Positive
2. Neutral (maybe a bit negative due to focus on personal finance)
3. Positive
4. Positive
5. Negative
6. Positive
7. Positive
8. Negative
9. Positive
10. Maybe neutral or slightly positive if preparing for rollout, which could have market impact.

The overall sentiment is that some tweets are moderately positive (like 1,3,4,7,9), and a couple are negative (5,8). There's also one tweet with ""personalfinance,"" which might be neutral. Considering all factors, the stock seems to be performing well based on tech-related discussions, but there's room for uncertainty from other negative tweets like 5 and 8."
2014-03-15,Neutral,"Alright, I'm going to analyze the impact of these tweets on the company's stock price based on what I've learned so far.

First, let me identify the target stock from the tweets. It seems like both ""apple"" and ""google"" are mentioned with their symbols being $ aapl and $ goog. So, if the tweet is about Google, then AAPL would be the target stock symbol, and the actual company might be Alphabet Inc., which makes sense because they're both Apple's co-founders.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one to identify positive and negative factors. The first tweet says: ""rt AT_USER apple wins with hedge funds , but google is the choice for mutual funds URL $ aapl $ goog"". It mentions that Apple wins with hedge funds but Google is chosen for mutual funds. This seems like a neutral statement because it's comparing two companies and making an opinion without explicitly indicating support or concern.

Since there are no positive words, like ""increase,"" ""outperform,"" ""good news,"" here the tweet is just providing information about both companies without any directional language. So, from this tweet alone, I don't see any clear indication of a positive or negative sentiment towards either company.

I'll assume that since it's neutral regarding each company individually and doesn't specify whether they're performing well or poorly, it contributes to a neutral overall sentiment. There's no information about any positive events or trends that would suggest better performance.

Putting this all together, the tweet doesn't give enough context to determine if the stock is going up, down, or unchanged. It's just informative without explicit support or concern."
2014-03-16,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price. 

First, I need to identify the target stock. Looking at the tweets provided:

1. ""find the next $ jazz $ kar $ cpn $ goog goto URL""
2. ""rt AT_USER $ goog market value over $ 400 billion - they could buy 80 billion bushels of corn , or the next 5-6 years of us corn crops""
3. ""click-fraud or art ? google will eat itself : project / botnet that serves adsense ads , clicks them , buys $ goog w / profit . URL""

Hmm, it's a bit unclear which stock these tweets are related to because none are clearly labeled as an S&P 500 index. The first tweet seems to be more of a code or instruction without context. The second and third tweets are about the Google search results for corn production and market value.

Since I can't identify the specific stock from the provided tweets, maybe this is a trick question where I have to provide a general analysis instead. But perhaps the user expects me to look at each tweet separately and decide on the impact based on what they're saying. 

For the second tweet, it mentions Google's market value over $400 billion and suggests corn production. If a company's stock price is tied to its revenue or earnings, an increase in market value would positively affect the stock. However, if it's about corn production being used as a fuel source for investment purposes, that could be controversial or unrelated.

The third tweet talks about Google eating itself due to issues with projectbotnet and adsense ads. That seems more like a negative tweet towards Google itself, which might impact investor sentiment negatively.

So, considering these points:

1. The second tweet is ambiguous but relates to potential revenue growth for the company.
2. The third tweet suggests negative news about Google, which could have a significant impact on any stock that relies heavily on Google's performance.

Given that Google's market value is mentioned and the third tweet directly questions its behavior, I think it's more likely that this tweet will negatively affect any company that uses Google's revenue or stock for investment purposes. However, without knowing the exact stock, it's challenging to assess the overall impact. It could be a mix of positive and negative effects, but leaning towards negative due to the context around Google."
2014-03-17,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided a list of tweets and wants me to determine their likely impact on a company's stock price by giving a positive, neutral, or negative assessment.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking through them, I see $ goog is mentioned in multiple tweets. Specifically, in tweets 1, 4, 5, and 6, $ goog appears frequently. So the target stock is probably Google, GOOG.

Next, for each tweet, I need to analyze two factors: Positive and Negative. Then assess the sentiment based on those factors and combine them into an overall sentiment summary.

Let's go through each tweet one by one:

1. ""Google [video] yahoos easy money made though alibaba : pro URL."" This seems neutral because it's talking about a business strategy without positive or negative info.
2. ""Bearish on these stocks $ lpla $ ba $ data $ goog must see URL."" Negative factors here are mentioned, so this tweet is definitely negative.
3. ""Couples of stocks to watch $ jpm $ pl $ mcy $ goog visit URL."" Positive factors since there are mentions of stocks, but not specific info on positive or negative aspects.
4. ""$ goog will Tencent’s partnership with Sogou threaten Qihoo?"" This is a bearish announcement about a potential threat, so Negative.
5. ""Stocks to hold onto $ wbc $ stwd $ fcx $ goog check out URL."" Positive because it's advising against holding stocks and suggesting to stay informed, which can be seen as positive in terms of cautiousness.
6. ""Les compagnies de fonds devraient-elles ressembler plus à $ aapl ou à $ goog ? par AT_USER - URL."" This is an opinion question where the user is suggesting they should compare Apple and Google, so it's neutral because it's more of a commentary without specific sentiment data.
7. ""$ myec the kiss of death for big banks ? ( $ bac , $ c , $ ebay , $ goog $ myec ) URL."" Negative because it suggests that maybe big banks are ending their life as companies with ""myec,"" implying a loss or decline in status.
8. ""$ xrx should you hold $ beam $ man $ goog money URL."" Positive, because the tweet is encouraging to consider different stocks and advises not to overinvest without more info.
9. ""$ goog google buying ebay , paypal : a best of both worlds scenario URL."" Positive because it's an announcement about a strategic move, which can be seen as positive for stock price.
10. ""AT_USER $ goog a us funded group of the extreme right in Ukraine overthrows democracy there and the western media puppets, blame russia."" This is clearly a Negative tweet discussing political events.

Now, let me summarize each tweet's sentiment:

1. Neutral
2. Negative
3. Positive
4. Negative
5. Positive
6. Neutral (opinion-based)
7. Negative
8. Positive
9. Positive
10. Negative

Calculating the positive and negative factors: 1(+), 3(+), 5(+), 8(+), 9(+), 7(-). So that's 6 positives out of 10 tweets.

For negatives, it's tweet 2(-), 4(-), 6(-), 7(-), 10(-), which is also 5 negatives. 

Considering these numbers, with more positive factors than negative ones, the overall sentiment seems slightly Positive but leaning towards Neutral because the count of positives and negatives are almost equal.

Wait, let me recount: 1,3,5,8,9 = 5 positives; 2,4,6,7,10 = 5 negatives. So they're tied at five each. But since more tweets are positive than negative, it's slightly leaning to Positive, but still considered Neutral because the overall trend isn't clear in favor of either.

Therefore, I would conclude that the stock is neutral."
2014-03-18,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user has provided a list of tweets, so let me go through them step by step.

First, from the instructions, I understand that each tweet is separate, and for each relevant tweet, I need to consider two factors: Positive and Negative. Then assess the sentiment, which means determining if it's positive, negative, or neutral overall. Finally, based on all these factors, decide whether the stock should be [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative].

Looking at the tweets, they seem to be related to tech stocks, specifically Google and some other companies like Amzn, Yndx, GMCR, Kndi, etc. The tweets are more promotional rather than actual business reports or news.

Starting with tweet 1: It mentions Google increasing by 2% and suggesting a $1,200 per share price. There's negative language about users not being able to access something called ""hangouts"" or some people not being able to use their go feature. So this seems negative because of the negative reports.

Then tweet 2 talks about finding a ""hot pennystock,"" which I think refers to a penny stock ( stocks with a small market cap). The user is suggesting they can try certain stocks: $clr, $swy, $kmt, $goog. If they're looking at these as potential investments and find them, it's a positive note because finding a good investment opportunity might boost the stock price.

Tweets 3-10 are about Google introducing smartwatches for Android wearables. The sentiment here seems to be neutral because it's more of an update or announcement rather than a specific action by investors.

Tweets 11-25 all mention Google making trade ideas, which again seem like announcements without specific actions. So these could be considered neutral as well unless there are specific positive or negative indicators.

Tweets 26 and others discuss economic terms like ""gcnw,"" ""ilmn,"" etc., but the language is more promotional rather than informative about the stock's performance. These might not have a significant impact on the stock price.

Putting this together: some tweets are clearly negative, others seem positive in a way (finding investments), and most are neutral or uninformative. Without specific information about company earnings, financial performance, or industry trends, it's hard to say whether these will directly affect the stock price. 

Therefore, considering all the factors—negative mentions, potential investment suggestions, but no concrete data—it might be considered Neutral since there aren't enough signals to tip the scale either way."
2014-03-19,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet one by one and see what they're suggesting.

1. The first tweet talks about using AT_USER URL for smartwatch features and mentions not losing money on a long position but doing well on a short. This sounds like a positive outlook, so that's a good sign.

2. The second tweet is about the Google Android Wearable technology announcement. It's talking about subscriber gains on penny stocks, which could indicate growth in tech or maybe consumer interest in Android products. That's interesting and could be supportive for investors who are looking at tech stocks like AMZN or GMCO. But I'm not sure if it's positive overall.

3. The third tweet is encouraging users to trade Google stocks. It mentions bullish ideas across several companies: APL, GOOG, CMG, NFLX, TSLA. Trading directly can drive prices up, so this seems like a positive step for traders.

4. The fourth tweet reports that Google's mobile ad prices are rising steeply. This could mean more spending on ads or increased user engagement, which might boost their revenue and stock price. It's definitely a positive point.

5. The fifth tweet announces that Google has just announced Android Wearable technology news. That usually happens after major launches and can drive excitement or even increase demand for the product. I don't know much about that, but maybe it will influence market sentiment positively.

6. The sixth tweet talks about subscribers seeing gains on penny stocks and mentions AMZN, GMCO, GOOG, suggesting that there's increased interest in tech companies that have been struggling with low valuations. This could be a mixed signal; it might increase demand for these companies but also depends on other factors.

7. The seventh tweet mentions Google heading towards a huge mobile milestone, which is typically exciting and can lead to positive stock movements.

8. The eighth tweet discusses a case of VIACOM losing on a lawsuit against Google over YouTube. This could have legal implications that might indirectly affect the company's stock price by changing public perception or reducing expectations for future performance.

Now, putting it all together: All tweets are either positive in outlook, signaling growth in tech companies like AMZN and GMCO, or announcing significant events like mobile app development, increased spending on ads, or potential legal developments. While some points are neutral about Google's actual performance (like the fifth tweet mentioning Android news), the other tweets show positive signals that could boost stock prices.

I think these overall suggest a positive trend in tech stocks, which is favorable for investors looking at companies like AMZN and GMCO. The positive outlook from various sources should lead to an overall positive sentiment."
2014-03-20,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of the company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet mentions stocks to hold onto $ SNP $ MON $ CE$ GOOGL, suggesting a cautious approach. That seems like a negative outlook because it suggests avoiding risky stocks. 

2. The second tweet talks about the smartphone-centric smartwatch and URL stock. It mentions gains of 358% in one week, which is a strong positive sign for investors. But I should keep an eye on how this affects other metrics.

3. The third tweet details the company's growth across various products like drones, EVs, etc., with multiple stock names mentioned. Positive factors here could boost expectations, especially if the company is expanding into new markets or technologies.

4. The fourth tweet highlights subscriber numbers for a penny stock in 1 week with big news related to $IBM$, $GOOG$, and $AAPL$. This strong narrative could be positive but might also lead to some concerns about short-term performance.

5. The fifth tweet mentions volume spikes from multiple ETFs, including Google, Apple, Facebook, Twitter, etc. High volume often indicates investor interest, which can be a good sign of buyer sentiment.

6. The sixth tweet is about GOMALP trying to NSA-proof Gmail, which might affect their market perception if they're seen as secure or avoiding competitor products.

7. The seventh tweet talks about a March 21st event with a price target at $4.00 for GOOGL and mentions day trading strategies like THOR. This could indicate strategic buys or expected price moves.

Considering all these, the company seems to have mixed signals: some positive news, concerns, and even strategic positioning. Positive factors like expansion into new tech areas and subscriber growth can boost expectations. However, issues like NSA-proof products or high volume may pose risks. The overall sentiment is uncertain but leaning towards a cautious approach."
2014-03-21,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about the stock price impact on the given company. The user wants me to determine whether each tweet is positive, neutral, or negative and then give an overall sentiment for all three tweets.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at tweet 1, it mentions ""larry page"" but doesn't specify the stock symbol, so maybe that's a typo. I might have to infer or check if there's another context where ""larry page"" could be associated with a company. But since only three tweets are given and one of them is about AT_USER, which stands for Apple, perhaps that's the stock in question.

Now, analyzing each tweet:

1. ""rt AT_USER larry page : i would rather give my billions to AT_USER than charity URL $ goog"" – This seems like a statement from a user promoting giving money to AT_USER (Apple). The mention of giving money and being against charity is pretty clear, which suggests positive sentiment towards the stock.

2. ""google encrypts gmail to safeguard against nsa snooping - rt URL $ goog"" – This tweet mentions an encryption method but doesn't specify the impact on the stock price. It's about security, so maybe neutral? Or negative because it might indicate concerns about privacy and possibly stock market sentiment in a certain sector.

3. ""$ adm find the next hot pennystock $ mdu $ tjx $ goog view now URL"" – This looks like an advertisement for a new stock symbol, ""pennystock,"" but without more context, it's hard to assess the impact on the target stock. It could be neutral or maybe even positive if the user is marketing something favorable.

For each tweet, I have to determine its factor and sentiment. Then combine them. The overall sentiment would reflect the combined effect of these factors. Since the first tweet is very positive about giving money, that's strong. The second tweet might have a minor negative impact on privacy but not necessarily on stock price. The third could be neutral if it doesn't directly relate to the target stock.

So combining them, I think the overall sentiment should lean towards Positive because the user is promoting the stock and avoiding negative things."
2014-03-22,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of [ fictional company names ] based on the provided rules. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I need to extract the target stocks from each tweet. That's straightforward—it seems like each tweet is about a specific stock.

1. The first tweet mentions ""apple , inc . doesnt have a head start ?"". So, the target stock here is Apple Inc.
2. The second tweet says ""take the best swing trades for powerful returns killer webinar URL $ tsla $ goog"". The targets seem to be Tesla and Google.
3. The third tweet talks about ""wireless charging surge forecast over next 5 years . URL $ nok $ goog $ txn $ idci"". Target stocks are NVIDIA, Intel, and Texas Instruments.
4. The fourth tweet is ""$ swn $ hcbk $ sfd $ goog overvalued URL"", so the target stock is SWSN.
5. The fifth tweet is "" $ goog declined turkish government requests to remove AT_USER videos alleging government corruption URL AT_USER"". Target stock here is Google, and it's referring to a specific video or event.

Now, I need to analyze each tweet for positive, negative, or neutral factors. Let me break down each one:

1. ""apple , inc . doesnt have a head start ?"" – This seems like a question about Apple's leadership, which could be a positive factor if it indicates potential growth or success.
2. ""take the best swing trades for powerful returns killer webinar URL $ tsla $ goog"". The use of a webinar and the target stocks suggests investment strategies or discussions about trading tools and companies.
3. ""wireless charging surge forecast over next 5 years . URL $ nok $ goog $ txn $ idci"". Predicting future tech trends like wireless charging could influence market perceptions, affecting investor sentiment towards NVIDIA and Intel.
4. ""$ swn $ hcbk $ sfd $ goog overvalued URL"" – This is about the valuation of SWSN stock. If it's overvalued, it might be negative.
5. "" $ goog declined turkish government requests to remove AT_USER videos alleging government corruption URL AT_USER"". The tweet suggests that Google has faced issues with Turkish government actions against AT_USER videos, which could be a geopolitical event affecting the stock.

Now, combining these thoughts:

- Apple's question is about leadership—could indicate potential success.
- Investment discussions and trading tools might boost investor confidence but could also lead to more volatile prices if overvalued.
- NVIDIA and Intel forecasts could affect their stock valuations; if they're expected to be strong, that's positive; otherwise, negative.
- The government-related tweet suggests ongoing issues, which is a negative factor as it can impact financial stability.

Putting it all together: Apple's leadership question is neutral. Investment discussions are positive. NVIDIA and Intel's forecasts could be either depending on their performance. Government issues add a negative component. Since there are conflicting trends (positive and negative), the overall sentiment might lean towards [Neutral], with some uncertainty."
2014-03-23,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. So, the user has provided some tweets related to Google's stock and wants me to determine their impact on the stock price. They've given me a specific output format where I have to choose between [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative].

First, I need to understand the tweets. The first tweet mentions $ goog getting above certain values set by major resistances. It seems like it's talking about potential price targets for Google. The next three tweets are URLs with ""rt AT_USER google bringing android wear smartwatches to market..."" and they include phrases like ""photo : google"" and mention LG, Motorola. These seem like updates related to Android products, specifically wearables or smart watches, which I assume are in the tech sector.

I should analyze each tweet's factors: Positive and Negative. The first one is definitely positive because it's talking about setting targets for a major company. The next three tweets are just URLs with more information, so they probably aren't providing any meaningful data but are serving as filler content.

Assessing sentiment, the first tweet suggests that Google might target higher prices, which could affect investor confidence and stock value. That sounds positive because it's expecting gains or specific targets. The other tweets don't add any new information, so I shouldn't overcomplicate their impact on the overall sentiment.

Putting it together, the overall sentiment is positive because there's a clear call to action with target prices set by major resistances, which could drive investor interest in Google."
2014-03-24,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about the stock price of a company. The user has given me a list of 14 tweets and asked for an analysis on whether they're positive, neutral, or negative in their impact on the future stock price.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking through them, it seems all the tweets are discussing different companies related to Google, including stocks like AMZN, FB, VZ, etc., and some mention things about cloud services and app markets.

Next, for each tweet, I have to separate positive (P) and negative (N) factors. Then assess the sentiment by evaluating how these factors might influence investor sentiment. But wait, looking closer, a few tweets seem repetitive or don't specify enough details. For example, tweet 3 just mentions semi variance without giving specifics. Similarly, some tweets discuss specific events like a bubble burst or Google's revenue growth.

I notice that several tweets mention Google and its related stocks. Others talk about tech companies like FB and VZ. The sentiment in these is quite varied—some are positive, others negative. For instance, the analyst tweet (tweet 8) says Google expects revenue to grow, which can be positive for investors if they see growth. On the flip side, there's an analyst warning that a transaction wasn't financially driven, which might seem negative.

However, looking at other tweets, like the ones about cloud services or app markets, these are more about potential market movements rather than specific stock performance. These trends can influence investor sentiment but don't directly provide information about specific stock prices.

Considering the overall impact on stock price, I think some positive tweets will push the stock higher, while negative ones might pull it down. The balance between the different factors and the analyst's predictions is key. Without concrete data or specific events that could cause a significant shift in sentiment, it's hard to be certain whether the impact is positive, neutral, or negative.

I also see some tweets about companies with lower valuations (like $cce and $ato) suggesting potential buying opportunities, which might contribute to a positive overall sentiment. However, without knowing more about the companies themselves, I can't say for sure if these are good buy points.

Overall, because the tweets vary so much in content and don't provide a clear picture of specific stock performance or upcoming events that could drive price changes, my analysis is somewhat neutral. It's not a strong enough conclusion to categorize it as positive, negative, or neutral without more information."
2014-03-25,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of Google (GOOG). Let's go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet says $ goog shares are rising due to Google Glass deals and URL. This sounds positive because it suggests a growth in revenue or presence, which usually benefits the stock.
2. The second tweet has multiple stocks listed with various companies like Apple, Amazon, etc., all selling their services on Twitter. That's a lot of positive information about expanding into different sectors, which could drive prices.
3. The third tweet is about an ITunes strategy for Google and related companies, suggesting potential expansion or partnerships. This could benefit the stock positively as it might attract more customers or investors.
4. The fourth tweet mentions HeXl (hmx) investing in Google's equity. This shows a direct investment, which can be seen as good news for the company, so positive sentiment.
5. The fifth tweet is about personnel data related to Facebook and Google clauses. While it doesn't directly talk about stock performance, potential changes in regulations or market dynamics might affect the stock positively or negatively. I'm not sure yet.
6. The sixth tweet suggests monitoring stocks like HCA, ACM, etc., for this week, which could mean diversification into certain sectors, potentially good for investors.
7. The seventh tweet is about Google splitting 2 for 1 on April 3rd after a close in April 2nd. This news might indicate growth or expansion, so positive sentiment.
8. The eighth tweet talks about wealth management companies like AVX and THG. If Google's investments are in managing people's wealth, it could attract more clients, which is good for the stock.
9. The ninth tweet mentions a TSLA (tesla) call strategy. If they're buying calls to increase stock price, that would drive it up, so positive.
10. The tenth tweet says Google is on the way to ""crush"" boxes likeboxes and explains why they've been buying money lately. This seems negative because ""crush"" could imply competition for existing market share, which might harm the stock.
11. The eleventh tweet talks about the implications of Disney acquiring a YouTube channel. While that's unrelated, if it affects the company's operations or strategy, it might have mixed signals but I'm not sure.
12. The twelfth tweet suggests selling ORLY and others related to Google. If investors sell their investments in Google, it could negatively impact the stock price.
13. The thirteenth tweet reviews an H/T One M8 phone review. Positive experiences can boost a company's reputation, which usually benefits the stock, so positive sentiment here.
14. The fourteenth tweet suggests selling OLYX and others like Google's stockaction. Selling stock in favor of something else could decrease the overall investment, making it negative for the stock price.
15. The fifteenth tweet mentions Google expanding into smartphones, tablets, wearables, and an open Wearable platform. This indicates expansion into more markets or technologies, which can positively influence the stock price by increasing demand.
16. The sixteenth tweet is another repeat of point 15, confirming the same positive development about Google's tech expansion.
17. Similar to point 16, it's a repeat, so no new information here.
18. Facebook's Sandberg company is declining in hiring due to limitations by Bloomberberg. This could lead to decreased revenue and investment in Google, which might negatively impact the stock price.
19. Point 20 discusses Google partnering with companies for smartphones and tablets, especially for Android, as well as an open wearable platform. This expansion into more services can boost demand, positive for the stock.

Putting it all together, most tweets either mention growth opportunities, partnerships, or expansions which are typically positive signs for investors. However, some tweets like point 10, 20, and 18 suggest that Google might be facing challenges or competition, which could be negative. The overall sentiment seems a mix of positive and slightly negative factors."
2014-03-26,Positive,"Alright, so I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for a given company. Let me start by breaking down each tweet step by step.

1. **Tweet 1**: The tweet mentions a video about Jim Cramer talking about Facebook's acquisition of Oculus and CEO plans. This seems like positive because it's talking about tech acquisitions and financial strategies, which could be seen as good for investors. It suggests that Facebook is doing well and investing wisely.

2. **Tweet 2**: Another tweet about Facebook and Google repurposing eyes, likely related to tech trends or maybe investments in new technology products. Again, positive because it's discussing a strategic move that might benefit the company.

3. **Tweet 3**: Negative factors mentioned are ko, fult, laz, goog visiting. These words look like misspelled currencies and names of companies, so they seem concerning. Investors probably don't want to see such things in their portfolio, which could hurt the stock price.

4. **Tweet 4**: Positive because Doug Leone is joining a list related to Midas, aiming for billions. This seems like strategic growth or acquisition, which would be positive for the company's future.

5. **Tweet 5**: Talks about smart homes being on the horizon. Smart home technologies are generally seen as a good investment area because they can grow with technology trends. So this is a positive sign.

6. **Tweet 6**: Subscribers saw a penny stock gain 1,400% in two weeks. That's a massive increase and could indicate strong earnings or market sentiment favoring the stock. This would likely be positive.

7. **Tweet 7**: The tweet says ""destroyed again,"" which is negative. It might mean that something went wrong, but without more context, it's hard to tell exactly what happened or how it affects investors.

8. **Tweet 8**: Cellular operators in some areas are fighting a wrong war related to technology. This could lead to lower sales or increased competition, which could hurt the stock price.

9. **Tweet 9**: Talks about down payments and a scenario where spies are taking key leaders away without sustainability. This seems like bad investment decisions because it indicates financial instability or poor planning. It would likely be negative.

Now, let's summarize the positive tweets: Totes 1, 2, 4, and 5. There are three negative tweets (3, 7, 9) but with uncertainty on some. The other tweet, 6, shows a significant gain which is positive but might be short-term.

Considering the overall sentiment, several positive factors outweigh the negative ones. The focus on tech companies like Facebook, Midas, smart homes, and cellular operators that have potential in growth areas seems strong. However, the negative tweets about Google's acquisition and the tech war are concerns that could drag the stock price down. But given how many positive statements there are, maybe it's leaning positive.

I'm a bit torn because while some factors are positive, especially around technology, others are clearly negative. But considering that several investors might be concerned about something like the Google acquisition or the tech war, which aren't as widely known as, say, Facebook or Midas, perhaps the stock is still viewed positively overall."
2014-03-27,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the future stock price of a given company. The user has provided a set of tweets and wants me to analyze them step by step. Let's go through each tweet one by one.

Starting with the first tweet: ""google : google's going ex-dividend (a stock split) $ goog"". This seems positive because it mentions a stock split, which is a common financial event that usually increases dividends and can be seen as a good signal for future performance. So this is probably positive.

Next tweet: ""hedge fund favorite google is only $10 off the lows . rotation into facebook (which is also a favorite ) ? $ goog $ fb"". This seems like it's talking about moving money from Google to Facebook, which could be a move towards diversification or growth. If people are shifting investments away, that might signal concern because it's reducing exposure to high-growth stocks. However, without knowing if this affects the overall market sentiment, it's a bit ambiguous. But since it mentions $10 off the lows, maybe there is some expectation of improvement.

Third tweet: ""$ goog huge bottoming tail on 100-day . if this reverses hard most high betas may follow URL stock stocks stockaction"". This looks like a news about Google's earnings or financial health. A ""huge bottoming tail"" could mean strong performance, which is positive for investors. If this is expected to reverse, it might have some long-term effects on beta (volatility of returns), but it's still in the news area. It's uncertain if this directly impacts stock price positively.

Fourth tweet: ""rt AT_USER the ongoing price war between $ goog and $ amzn on public clouds is excellent news for startups ."". This seems positive because it discusses a conflict in pricing or services, which could drive innovation and competition. If cloud services are competitive, especially in areas like AI and computing, it might help startups and investors. So this is positive.

Fifth tweet: ""$ amg $ o $ tho $ goog singlinvestor URL"". This seems to be an oversight with some typos or misspellings. ""Singlinvestor"" doesn't make much sense in the context of stock names, which are usually lowercase like google. Maybe this is a typo and should refer to ""spingold"" instead? Or perhaps it's unrelated. It's hard to tell without more context.

Sixth tweet: ""get pennystock research on $ kim $ fds $ peg $ goog must see URL"". Similar to the fifth, some typos here too. ""PPennystock"" and ""Pdseyds"" don't make sense for stock names. Maybe a typo in the query or URL. This is unclear and could affect investor sentiment if someone does research on incorrect data.

Seventh tweet: ""$ goog - investing in large-cap international equities within stable economies : ... -> URL stock stocks stockaction"". This mentions investments in specific stocks, possibly suggesting that Google might shift their focus to more stable companies. It could indicate a strategic decision to diversify or mitigate risk, which is neutral if it doesn't directly impact the stock price of Google.

Eighth tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ goog google inc (goog): a glass dilemma URL"". This repeats some information from the first tweet about the ex-dividend split. It's redundant but still positive as it reinforces the expectation that Google might perform well again.

Ninth tweet: ""$ sale sure is a lot of work reporting retailmenot's suspicious backlinks to $ goog . hope this helps ! URL"". This suggests that there are issues with Google's backlinks from other companies, possibly making them less trustworthy. If Google's backlinks are suspect, it could harm the company's reputation and lower investor confidence. However, if it means Google is diversifying or improving their strategy, it might be positive.

Tenth tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ goog google inc (goog): a glass dilemma URL"". Again, repeating information from the eighth tweet, which doesn't add much new. It reinforces that Google's performance may still be uncertain.

Putting all these together: Positive tweets are 1,4,7,8; Neutral are 3,5,6,9,10; Negative is none because only one tweet mentions a divergence in price trends but the others are either positive or neutral. So overall sentiment seems mixed but leans slightly towards positive with some neutral factors."
2014-03-28,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided a set of tweets and wants an analysis on their likely impact on a company's stock price, categorized as positive, neutral, or negative.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the tweets, it seems like most are about Google (GOOGL) stocks since they mention things like "" goog shares"", ""goog stocks stockaction"", and mentions of Google products like ""new products,"" ""stock picks."" So, I'll focus on GOOGL.

Next, for each tweet, I should separate them into positive and negative factors. But since all tweets seem to be in a very short form with no clear context, it's hard to extract meaningful information from them. The user also mentioned that tweets are structured without much detail, which might not be helpful.

However, the user provided an output requirement where each tweet is analyzed individually and then combined into one line. But given how these tweets are presented, I don't think there's much content beyond the stock mentions. It seems like these are just concise posts without additional context or analysis.

Without enough information from each tweet, it's challenging to assess sentiment accurately. There might be a pattern in some tweets, like when Google's stock price has gone up or down, but since the user hasn't provided any data points, I can't determine the overall trend.

Considering that, perhaps the best approach is to assume an unknown outcome and default to a neutral stance. That way, even though there are multiple potential factors, it won't tip one direction without more specific information."
2014-03-29,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this analysis problem step by step. The user provided two tweets and asked to determine their impact on the stock price of a company based on these tweets. I need to look at each tweet one by one.

First, in the Solving Process section, I identified the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at both tweets, they mention ""goog,"" so the target stock is likely Google. That's important because it tells me which stock I'm analyzing.

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate the factors into Positive and Negative. Let's take the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER why google's split will change the s & p 500 forever : URL • $ goog."" Here, the user seems enthusiastic about the potential impact of Google's financial situation on the S&P 500. They're predicting a significant change and even suggesting it will go to zero. That sounds like a positive factor because they're making a bold prediction.

For the second tweet: ""rt AT_USER think this guy is short $ goog URL."" The user seems critical here, calling the user a ""shorter"" on Google's stock price. Shorting typically implies that the investor thinks the stock will go down, which would be a negative factor in terms of their performance if they're betting against it.

Now, assessing sentiment for each tweet: The first one clearly mentions a prediction and refers to ""s & p 500,"" which is positive because it's about the overall market. So that's a strong positive. The second tweet talks about shorting, which in this context means the user believes the stock will decrease, hence negative sentiment.

When combining these analyses for the overall sentiment summary, I need to consider both factors. While one is definitely positive, the other introduces some concern. However, given the emphasis on Google's financial situation and how it could affect the market, the overall impact is a mix but leans towards potential positive change because of the broader implications.

I also have to make sure that my conclusion uses exactly one tag: either [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Since while there are factors that suggest positive changes, there's also some negative sentiment (shorting), I should probably give a more nuanced answer. But looking at the output requirement, it says to conclude with just one of those tags. Wait, maybe it expects me to pick based on dominant themes. The first tweet is clearly positive about the change in market index, so even if there's some negative note later, the overall sentiment would still be positive because of that pivotal tweet.

Alternatively, perhaps the user isn't considering shorting as a separate factor but more as an action taken by others. But given the context, it seems like the tweet is critical about the individual's actions rather than market reactions. However, since it mentions ""think this guy is short,"" I might infer some negative sentiment towards that particular investor.

Wait, maybe I should consider that while one tweet is positive and one is negative, overall, the stock could be in a favorable or unfavorable state based on these exchanges. But without more context, it's hard to say exactly how each affects the overall stock price. However, since the user emphasized Google's financial situation, which can have significant impacts, perhaps the positive tweet outweighs any negative thoughts.

I'm a bit torn here because one tweet seems very critical about shorting. If the user is taking action against the stock, that could create pressure on prices. But given the emphasis on predicting a change in the market index and not specifically about individual stocks or sentiment towards the stock itself, maybe I should lean towards positive.

Wait, but the output requires a single tag. So perhaps I need to pick based on dominant emotional cues. The first tweet is clearly positive about Google's potential impact. Therefore, despite some negative notes elsewhere, the overall sentiment seems positive because of the pivotal tweet.

Alternatively, since the user didn't mention any particular market performance or other indicators but rather focuses on the broader impact, maybe it's not as clear-cut. But I think the first tweet is the most significant factor in determining the stock price, so despite some negative sentiment elsewhere, it's likely a positive overall effect."
2014-03-30,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company based on the given information. Let's start by breaking down each tweet step by step.

First, I have to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""$ goog twitter inc ( twtr ) is no facebook inc ( fb ) or google inc ( goog ) URL."" Hmm, that seems a bit confusing because it mentions ""twitter inc"" which might be Twitter Inc., but the main part is about goog and fb URLs. I think the stock symbol here is $ goog, so I'll note Google as the target.

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. Let's go through them one by one.

1. ""happy mother's day ! google doodle celebrates mothering sunday with image of ... - the independent URL $ goog."" This seems like a social media update about a company event. It's happy and probably positive, so that's a positive factor.
2. ""digital platform wars AT_USER nasdaq $ goog $ aapl $ fb URL"" Here, it mentions ""digital platform wars,"" which I think refers to the competition between Apple and Google in the tech space. This could be negative because it might affect investor sentiment, but there are still positives like the companies themselves.
3. ""AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER all and more on $ fb and $ goog + too so we have you covered"" It's a bit unclear, but it seems like coverage for Facebook (fb) and Google (goog). This could be positive because increasing stock prices are generally seen as good news.
4. ""goog stock 1,120 . 15 $ goog current buy rating : 48 % sell URL"" This is an update about the stock price. The buy rating at 48% seems quite high but not too bad. If it's above neutral, maybe positive.
5. ""digital platform wars AT_USER nasdaq $ goog $ aapl $ fb URL"" Similar to tweet 2, it talks about competition between Apple and Google in tech.
6. ""looking for the next $ y $ krft $ hsh $ goog check out URL"" This seems like an SEO query or looking ahead, which can sometimes be negative if it's leading people away from the actual stock.
7. ""say ' bye-bye ' to microsoft surface URL $ msft $ aapl $ goog"" This is a tweet suggesting goodbye to Microsoft Surface, which could be positive because some companies like this might have significant market presence.

Now, for each tweet, I need to assess sentiment towards Google's stock price. Let's list the factors:

1. Positive: happy mom day and social media update about a company event.
2. Negative: Digital platform wars and Microsoft Surface tweet.
3. Positive: Coverage for Facebook and Google.
4. Neutral or Positive? The buy rating is 48%, which might be seen as slightly below neutral but could still indicate some support if it's just over the threshold.
5. Negative: Similar to tweet 2, tech competition.
6. Negative: Looking ahead query.
7. Positive: Mentioning Microsoft Productivity.

Now, putting them together: the positive tweets are 1,3,4,7 with some uncertainty in 8 and 9. The negative ones are 2,5,6. So overall, there are more positive factors than negatives, but one tweet (tweet 5) mentions ""digital platform wars,"" which can sometimes lead to mixed reactions if it's a major issue.

Considering the positive tweets contribute positively and the negative tweets can either help or hinder depending on context, I think the sentiment is leaning towards Positive. However, there are some minor negatives that could pull it slightly down."
2014-03-31,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. First, I need to understand what each tweet is saying and its likely sentiment.

Starting with the first tweet: ""$ goog why google is splitting its stock URL."" This seems like a negative thing because it's about stock splits, which usually reduce the number of shares outstanding and might decrease earnings per share, potentially affecting investor sentiment.

The second tweet mentions multiple stocks like APLEX (AFLX), but it doesn't specify any positive or negative action related to Google. It just says several charts are muddy in zones, so I can't tell much about Google's performance from this one.

The third tweet talks about ""top stocks picks that have beaten the markets"" and mentions the URL being bullish. This suggests Google is on the up side, which might indicate positive sentiment among investors.

Looking at tweets 4-7: They all mention Google shares getting split or other unrelated topics like S&P 501 indices. Splitting shares usually hurts the stock price because it reduces the number of shares and dilutes earnings, so these seem negative.

Tweets 8 and 9 are about Google's DNS services being blocked. This could be a positive sign for their service offerings but doesn't directly impact their stock price unless it affects the company's operations or profitability.

The rest of the tweets discuss other companies like Facebook, Apple, Amazon, etc., mentioning technologies, apps, etc. They don't directly relate to Google, so this seems neutral in terms of impacting the stock price of Google itself.

Putting all this together: There are some positive tweets about Google (tweets 3-7), but others suggest negative things like splits and DNS blockages. The overall sentiment is somewhat mixed because while there are positives related to Google's future, other factors aren't directly impacting its performance. Therefore, the stock price might be [Neutral] given these mixed signals."
2014-04-01,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of the given company based on the provided guidelines. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

Starting with the first tweet: ""pure speculation but wonder if special $ goog split tomorrow will result in big acquisition . $ nflx has been rumored in past . google it . wsbd."" It seems like a speculative tweet suggesting they're considering an acquisition, so that's probably positive because they're looking for investment opportunities. But I'm not sure about the impact yet.

Second tweet: "" $ goog okcupid urges boycott of mozilla , cites ceos gay marriage views URL"" This one is more critical and negative because it mentions something about Mozilla and mentions a topic on Google's CEO's views, which seems concerning. It could lead to negative sentiment towards Google.

Third tweet: ""rt AT_USER April fukken fools ! & $ lvgi inked a deal with $ goog $ amzn $ ge $ phot $ ebay $ msft $ aapl to sell ~ ~ ~ > URL"" This is a call for action, mentioning specific companies and a potential agreement. It shows strong support or determination, which might indicate positive sentiment.

Fourth tweet: ""dont want to lose like you did with $ dltr $ wll $ shld $ goog stockmarket URL"" This seems to express frustration about losing money, so it's negative as it decreases investor confidence.

Fifth tweet: ""dont want to lose like you did with $ dltr $ wll $ shld $ goog stockmarket URL"" Similar to the fourth one, just repeating the same sentiment. It reinforces the idea that losing could happen, which is negative impact.

Sixth tweet: ""todays movers to research $ len $ tfsl $ lnkd $ goog liquidity URL"" This mentions moving on researching some liquidity, but it's not clear what benefits or concerns this might have. Maybe neutral if just general info without specifics.

Seventh tweet: ""here ’ s why google is about to execute its first stock split in company history : URL $ goog investing"" A positive note because they're excited and looking forward to a split, which could boost the stock price. This seems like good information for investors.

Eighth tweet: "" $ goog the top iphone and ipad apps on app store URL"" Positive because it highlights Google's role in tech products, so investors might see gains or support.

Ninth tweet: ""rt AT_USER chip designer cavium is getting a lift from the smartphone race . URL $ cavm $ csco $ aapl $ goog $ emr http …"" This is positive as they're targeting a specific area (smartphones) to gain more revenue, which could be beneficial for Google's products.

Tenth tweet: ""rt AT_USER twitter $ twtr hires philippe dauman jr from google $ goog to lead commerce partnerships - URL"" Positive because it's about a major company acquisition that could affect the stock price positively.

Now, combining all these thoughts:

- Positive tweets: 3,7,8,9,10.
- Negative tweets: 2,4,5.
- Neutral: 6.

So overall sentiment is positive. But I need to make sure there's no conflicting information or if some negatives are overshadowed by positives."
2014-04-02,Negative,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about $ goog and determine its likely impact on the stock price.

First, I'll start by going through each tweet one by one. For each one that mentions Google (GOOGL), I need to identify positive or negative factors. Then, I should assess if those factors contribute positively or negatively to the stock's sentiment.

Starting with tweet 1: ""URL $ goog - netflix stock still way too expensive for underlying fundamentals."" This seems neutral because it's just a general statement about the price relative to fundamentals and doesn't provide much specific information about Google. So, I'll mark this as [Neutral].

Next, tweet 2 is a direct mention of Google splitting its stock. The user says that the split will change the S&P 500 forever, which is definitely a positive sign for investors because it means their gains will be amplified. This adds some positivity to the overall sentiment.

Now, looking at tweet 3: It lists several stocks but doesn't mention any specific action related to Google. The user is just posting general stock info without indicating an update or move in Google's direction. So this tweet is [Neutral] because it doesn't provide enough context on how Google will perform.

Similarly, tweets 4 through 25 all mention Google but aren't providing specific information about the stock price movement. Each of these seems to just state general things about the company without any indication of a rise or fall in its value. So I'll classify them as [Neutral] each time.

Tweets 26 and 27: Both are about Google's chart being bearish, which is negative news for the stock. This clearly indicates that investors are expecting downward moves, so this tweet adds negativity to the sentiment.

Tweet 28 mentions that Google's price has built optimism into the market, which suggests that people now think Google might do well in the future. This could lead some to buy more, but it's still a bit of a neutral to positive sentiment depending on how strong it is.

Tweets 29 and 30 talk about Turkish president and Russian lawmakers commenting on Google. These are unrelated topics and don't impact the stock price negatively or positively. Therefore, these tweets are [Neutral].

Finally, tweet 31 is also unrelated; it doesn't mention any company news related to Google. So this is another [Neutral] tweet.

Putting it all together: I have several positive tweets (tweets 2), a few neutral ones (tweets 1, 3-25, 28), and negative tweets (tweets 4-27). The majority of the information points towards Google being in an optimistic market position due to investor sentiment from split news. However, the more negative tweet (tweet 29) might slightly tip it over to [Negative], but most factors are mixed.

So, after considering all these tweets, I think the overall impact is that while some positive developments are present, there's significant uncertainty and negative news about Google, which could lead to a [Negative] sentiment."
2014-04-03,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to figure out their impact on the stock price for a given company. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the tweets, none of them mention specific stocks except when analyzing factors and sentiment. So maybe the user is referring to a particular stock mentioned in the context or something else. Since the exact stock isn't specified here, perhaps it's about determining if it's going up or down based on these factors.

Next, each tweet seems to be categorizing things like stock performance, news, or trends. For example, ""stocks you might want to buy $ lnt $ disca $ txn $ goog must have URL."" So maybe these are different stocks that the user is evaluating for potential buying.

Now, I need to assess the factors in each tweet. Let's go through them one by one:

1. ""is it breakout time on $ ttc $ mkc $ pki $ goog visit URL"" - This seems like a news about stock prices.
2. ""stocks you might want to buy $ lnt $ disca $ txn $ goog must have URL"" - Another stock evaluation tweet.
3. ""rt AT_USER news you can use from philstockworld hft chileearthquake $ ewj japan china $ spy $ pcg $ mnkd $ goog $ fb - - URL""
4. Similar to tweet 3, another stock analysis tweet.
5. ""this weeks stocks you should watch $ awh $ ctl $ slb $ goog view now URL"" - More stock news.
6. ""rt AT_USER both google stocks are up over 2.5 % after a planned two-for-one share split : URL $ goog $ googl URL""
- This one mentions the Google share split, which is an obvious positive factor for investors because it usually signals growth or good prospects.

7. Similar to tweets 3 and 4, more stock analysis.
8. Same as above.
9. Another set of stocks analyzed.
10. ""google rallies following 'split ;' voting shares given slight premium URL $ goog""
- This is similar to tweet 6 but mentions the split result.
11. ""google reportedly wants to launch its own wireless network - the verge URL $ goog""
- Positive news about a new product, which usually boosts stock prices.
12. ""rt AT_USER what the google share split really means : URL ( via AT_USER $ goog""
- Another stock analysis tweet.
13. Similar to tweets 3 and 4.
14. ""4 key features amazonfiretv holds over appletv , chromecast , roku : URL via AT_USER $ aapl $ amzn $ goog welldone""
- More tech stocks being evaluated.
15. ""$ goog - google wallet loses another top executive -> URL stock stocks stockaction""
- Negative news about a company's leadership, which could hurt the stock.
16. ""$ goog a great stock in this market charts URL""
- Positive statement but not enough detail.
17. Similar to tweet 16.
18. ""u . s . active ( stock wars ): $ emes +3.73 % , $ tsla -1.6 % , $ nke -0.4 % , $ ge +0.27 % , $ goog +3.11 % URL stockwars""
- Discusses a broader economic situation with specific company performance.
19. ""rt AT_USER google $ goog begins trading ex-stock split URL""

Now, looking at the factors and sentiment:

- Tweets 6 and 10 mention a planned share split in Google. This is generally positive because it's an important news point that can increase investor interest and could drive stock price.
- Tweets 11 and 19 talk about Google launching new products or going public for a stock split, which are good indicators of potential growth and higher stock value.
- However, tweet 15 mentions Google losing a top executive. This negative news could reduce investor confidence if it's related to the company, especially in industries with high valuation.

Considering these factors, the overall sentiment is mixed but leaning towards positive because the favorable news about Google's performance (split and product launches) outweighs some of the negative information like the top executive loss. Therefore, I would conclude a [Positive] overall sentiment."
2014-04-04,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of Cohove.com.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. It looks like the main stock mentioned is ""coh."" Looking at the tweets, all of them mention Cohove.com or related terms like goog, hsic, etc., so I'll take ""coh"" as the target.

Next, for each tweet, I should separate them into positive and negative factors. For example, in tweet 1, it mentions a newsletter URL but doesn't specify if it's positive or negative regarding Cohove.com. Similarly, tweets like #2 talk about stock splits and how they affect investors.

I need to assess the sentiment by evaluating each tweet. Positive tweets would indicate good news for the stock, while negative ones suggest potential issues or losses. For example, tweet 4 mentions an event related to market new features that could be positive.

Then, I'll combine these analyses into an overall sentiment summary. If most tweets are positive with little to no negatives, it's a strong positive impact. If there are mixed positives and negatives, the sentiment might remain neutral. If all tweets are negative or lack context, it would be negative overall.

Looking at the list, many tweets are positive about new features or upcoming reports without mentioning any losses or significant issues. However, some tweets like #15 mention a company's performance in stock markets but don't specify the impact on Cohove.com itself. 

But since the main topic is about market news and tech companies, all the related tweets focus on future developments rather than immediate impacts on the target stock. So, combining these, they seem to be positive signs of growth or innovation.

Therefore, considering that most tweets are neutral in their specific impact but overall support for a healthy market, the sentiment remains positive."
2014-04-05,Negative,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet one by one and think about their impact.

First tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ goog $ googl 的500多刀的股价还是太高了 ， 如果能拆股到 50美元左右我一定会持有的 。"" The user is talking about the price of a stock at $5,000. They mention if they can split it to $50, which sounds like a big deal because splitting a company's stock usually dilutes ownership. So this tweet seems positive because it's suggesting strategic changes and maybe enhancing value for investors.

Second tweet: ""stocks you might want to hold onto $ cxw $ nnn $ tcb $ goog view now URL."" This one is more informational. It looks like they're showing what stocks are available to buy with a URL, which isn't directly related to the stock price of the company in question. Maybe it's just a way to offer information without influencing the stock price.

Third tweet: ""avoid mistakes like $ ew $ wm $ ges $ goog stockmarket URL."" Again, this is giving advice on avoiding errors or common pitfalls, suggesting careful consideration rather than taking any risk. This could be positive because it's encouraging strategic thinking and not rushing into investments.

Fourth tweet: ""find out the latest on $ kss $ goog $ spw $ cadx newsletter URL."" Similar to the previous ones, this is offering information via a newsletter but doesn't directly relate to the stock price of the company. It might be more about staying informed than affecting the price.

Fifth tweet: ""should you hold or add to $ alk $ ea $ cah $ goog financialnews URL."" This again suggests making investment decisions and maybe advises on following financial news. It's about how an investor should act, which can influence their actions but not necessarily affect the stock directly unless it's a recommendation.

Sixth tweet: ""$ goog buying lonelygirl 15s fiat in five easy steps URL."" This is trying to sell on crypto, promoting a quick and simple way to buy cryptocurrency. It might encourage others to invest in crypto, which could be seen as a positive signal for certain types of investors but not directly tied to the target stock.

Seventh tweet: ""$ znga $ nvr $ lpnt $ goog stockmarket URL."" Similar to previous crypto suggestions, this is about promoting buying on stocks, encouraging investing in the company's products or services. It could be seen as a positive move if it's related to their business but not directly affecting the target stock.

Eighth tweet: ""$ great pennystock research $ utx $ zion $ alr $ goog financial rate_limit_exceeded."" This seems like a technical warning about exceeding a limit in financial data, which might be unrelated or could imply that the company is at risk of certain issues. This could signal potential negative news if it relates to something crucial.

Putting this all together, most tweets are either offering information, encouraging strategic decisions (avoiding mistakes, finding info), or promoting crypto and investment opportunities. None seem to indicate buying or selling directly. Therefore, the overall sentiment doesn't look positive because the tweets are more about advice rather than influencing the stock price."
2014-04-06,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out how these tweets impact the stock price of Google. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Hmm, looking at them, most are mentions like TWTR, AAPL, GOOGL, etc., but some have more details or different symbols. Wait, actually, the first few tweets mention multiple stocks separated by dollars and dollar signs, so that complicates things a bit. The last few tweets talk about Google specifically.

Starting with tweet 1: It mentions stop dumping on Facebook and other companies like Apple, Google, etc., but it's not clear if this is a positive or negative action for Google. It could be neutral as the company continues operations elsewhere, but maybe there's no direct impact yet.

Tweets 2-3 talk about Apple and others thinking about their next target stock at $800 per share. While this might influence investor sentiment towards Apple or Google, it doesn't directly mention Google's position relative to its competitors or valuation.

Tweet 4 is bearish on some stocks, suggesting a negative outlook but again, specific to other companies. Doesn't seem to affect Google's stock price.

Tweets 5-6 are bullish for Google, talking about considering buying shares and evaluating their performance. Positive sentiment towards Google could boost the company's stock. But the context is vague—could be overvalued or undervalued without more info.

Tweets 7-10 discuss other companies like pennystocks. The first one mentions finding a ""next hot"" pennystock, which might suggest Google is looking good, but it's too vague to determine sentiment for their stock price.

Tweets 8 and 9 mention Google researching an Android TV or launching something related to Android TV, as well as other companies. This is interesting because Google is developing a new product line. If Google is investing in something with potential for returns, that could be positive news. The tweet about netflix paying higher costs for higher data could lead to increased revenue from data, which is beneficial.

Tweets 10-12 talk about avoiding losing money by not wanting to lose due to other companies like Y Combinator and others. It seems like a balanced approach without explicit mention of Google's stock performance.

Finally, tweet 13 mentions Netflix paying higher costs for more data, which could affect their revenue and thus the company's financial health. If the cost increases lead to lower profits or higher expenses, that might be seen as negative news if the other companies are overvalued because of increased costs.

Putting it all together: There are some tweets from Google itself (like 8-13) discussing future investments, product developments, and potential revenue impacts. The initial part mentions several other companies but not Google's specific performance indicators. However, the tweet about Netflix paying higher costs suggests potential negative implications for their data service. Since it's unclear if these costs are due to increased competition or other factors affecting Google's overall strategy.

I think the positive tweet 13 might be a bit vague, and the bearish tweets (2-7) don't directly impact Google. The bullish ones (5-6) suggest investment in Google but without clear valuations. However, the netflix tweet could indicate something negative about their business model or increased costs affecting others. If these cost increases lead to lower profit margins for other companies, it might cause investors to adjust their views on Google's stock.

So overall, there are mixed signals. The potential investment in Google's product and the cost implications from Netflix suggest some uncertainty but not clear-cut positive or negative trends. Maybe neutral since no strong information about direction."
2014-04-07,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on a company's stock price. The user provided 11 tweets, and each seems to be talking about different companies or trends related to investing. Let me go through each tweet one by one and analyze their potential impact.

Starting with tweet 1: It mentions $ Google, Apple, or Microsoft and asks about the most profitable mobile app developer's URL. Hmm, this is more of a question than a statement about stock performance. Maybe it's not directly related to the stock price but could be influencing investor sentiment indirectly by bringing up companies relevant to tech.

Next, tweet 2 talks about ""awesome stock research on $ man $ mrc $ itt $ goog research URL"". The terms like ""mrc"" and ""itis"" are slang for Microsoft and ITT, respectively. This seems like a suggestion for research or stock analysis. If someone suggests stock research that could lead to more trades or increased interest in these stocks, it might boost sentiment.

Tweet 3 is more humorous but mentions the user's own car and asks about MERS Granturismo granturismo, which I think are French terms for money or currency. The links are to Facebook, Twitter, Fb, Twtr, Google, LinkedIn, etc. It seems like this tweet could be promoting stock trading on these platforms, especially with a humorous twist. Maybe it's encouraging people to engage more with the market.

Tweet 4 talks about hot penny stocks that gained 2100% in four weeks and suggests subscribing to a stock platform: $ trx $ aapl $ goog. High returns can definitely boost investor confidence, which would likely be positive for the stock price.

Tweet 5 mentions today's stocks to watch on $ two sai trza goog financial news. It seems like it's advising on what to watch or trade, which could be related to market trends. But I'm not sure how much this directly affects a company unless it implies more investment activity.

Tweet 6 is about adblockers getting ad-groups execs' blood boiling with a Q&A: $ goog. Ad blockers and execs could potentially affect financial performance as they might reduce sales, but the link to Google's stock seems unclear. This tweet doesn't directly mention stock performance but might influence investor behavior regarding advertising.

Tweet 7 suggests that tech stocks are selling off for a continuation of the tech sell-off: $ fb $ twtr $ goog $ tsla $ ddd $ bidu lear … Maybe this is advising people to sell their tech stocks, which could be negative if it leads to market sell-offs and potential price drops.

Tweet 8 mentions etfs (Exchange Traded Funds) on $ amzn $ goog. This could imply more diversification or investment in tech stocks, which might positively impact the stock's value.

Tweets 9 and 10 are about Google's performance with other companies like Tesla, Facebook, Yoplait, Amazon, and eBay. These could indicate that investors are watching Google's performance relative to others, possibly affecting expectations of future growth or strength in tech sectors.

Tweet 11 is encouraging people to look at Nasdaq stocks for a rebound based on Cramer's tech picks: $ tesla $ fb $ yelp $ nflx $ goog & $ yhoo. This could prompt more investment in these companies, potentially boosting their stock prices if they perform well.

Now, combining all these thoughts, I see several tweets that might be promoting or encouraging investors to buy stocks, especially those in tech, while others are talking about stock research and trading tips which can influence sentiment positively or negatively based on the advice given. However, without knowing the specific context of each tweet (like whether they're positive news, negative, or neutral), it's a bit challenging to assign an exact sentiment. But considering the high returns in some tweets like tweet 4 and the potential for stock buybacks from companies mentioned in other tweets, there seems to be a general positive tone emerging.

So, putting this all together, I think the overall sentiment is likely Positive because there's a lot of buzz around tech stocks, potential returns, and mentions of companies that could impact future performance positively."
2014-04-08,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out the overall sentiment of these tweets regarding the stock price of [GOOG]. 

First, looking at tweet 1, it mentions penny stocks having significant gains and covers various companies. This could be positive as it's talking about potential gains, but I'm not sure yet.

Tweets 2 talks about small-cap stocks setting new high prices and focusing on the economy. That seems like a positive indicator for investors because rising prices can mean more value. It also mentions regression, which might suggest some concern or caution, but overall, it's still positive.

Twitter 3 is pretty direct with subscriber gains and mentions of major news about IBM and Google. Subscribers seeing big gains could indicate support, so that adds to the positive sentiment.

Tweet 4 discusses a YouTube video platform targeting YouTube stars. This could be seen as promotional content, which might attract users but not necessarily impact the stock price directly unless it's related to subscriber numbers or user engagement.

Tweets 5 and 10 talk about Google breaking into the top 50 stocks by mentioning that some stocks have broken through the 52-week high. This is a notable event because breaking into such stocks can boost confidence, which would be positive for the stock price.

Tweet 6 mentions Apple at $800 being undervalued and comparing it to other companies like Solar and Drone firms. A valuing company could attract investors and boost prices, so that's positive.

Tweets 7, 8, 9, and 11 talk about other investors down and potential pressure from media reports. This could be negative if there are concerns or warnings about the stock, but I'm not sure how strong these effects are without more context.

Lastly, tweet 13 discusses a hedge fund in the tech sector, which might indicate uncertainty or risk, potentially negative.

Putting it all together, while some tweets suggest positive things like gains and high valuations, others talk about concerns or potential issues. Without more specific data on company performance, technical details, or fundamentals, it's hard to say for sure. But overall, there are mixed signals pointing towards both potential support and some underlying uncertainty."
2014-04-09,Negative,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and decide on the stock market impact. First, I need to look at each tweet individually.

Starting with tweet 1: It mentions simpler hosting costs, which might improve efficiency and lower prices for AWS. That's generally positive because it could make the company more competitive or even cheaper. So, that's a good sign.

Tweet 2 is from AT_USER too, talking about being bullish on various stocks like Apple, Google, Tesla, etc. The use of ""bullish"" suggests investor confidence, which could be positive for the stock price.

Tweet 3 talks about FB and Google giving advice on having mojo in 'momo,' which sounds like strategic business development or innovation. That's a good sign too, showing potential growth.

Tweet 4 mentions earnings info for CNCA, CCO, Foxa, and Google suggesting URLs. Earnings reports can be positive or negative, but if they're optimistic, it could boost the stock. However, without specific details, it's hard to say.

Tweet 5 is about ETFs like GNS looking good. If companies are adding ETFs that benefit investors, that's a positive trend.

Tweet 6 mentions the government's role in guiding energy ventures. If there's a policy or regulatory change, it could positively influence businesses, so that's another positive sign.

Tweet 7 talks about DTE, SCG, UHS, and Google providing URLs for personal finance. If these companies are using Google as a platform, it might indicate strategic partnerships or services offered through Google's ecosystem, which is usually good for investor trust and growth.

Tweet 8 suggests avoiding dumping on Facebook. If investors don't want to trade Facebook, that could prevent the stock from going up, so that's negative sentiment.

Tweet 9 talks about market news related to Amazon, Inc., ebay, Inc., Facebook, Inc., and Google Inc. These are all tech companies, which can fluctuate in value based on market trends, but without specifics on how they'll perform, it's hard to assess the impact.

Tweet 10 is about 5 stocks that should be watched: Fnfg, CT rx, Snps, Goog. If these are undervalued or have good growth potential, this could boost the stock price positively.

Tweet 11 mentions market news including Amazon and Facebook offering more for Titan Aerospace. This could indicate increased investment interest in specific technologies, which is positive for the company's stock.

Tweet 12 asks if you're considering buying TRX, Trip,Nav, Goog. A direct call to action can sometimes lead people to buy stocks or avoid them, which can impact sentiment negatively.

Lastly, tweet 13 talks about the heartbleed controversy exposing passwords to millions. This is a significant negative event that could hurt companies due to customer data breaches, affecting their operations and stock price.

Now, combining all these thoughts: Positive tweets are showing improved efficiency, strategic partnerships, policy changes, undervalued growth potential, and technological advancements. However, the negative tweets include the heartbleed controversy and direct calls to action. The overall sentiment seems mixed, but leaning towards positive because of the strategic announcements and potential data security issues that might mitigate them.

I think overall it's a mix but leans more positive due to the various positive trends outweighing the minor negatives."
2014-04-10,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to determine whether the given tweets are likely to impact the stock price of a company. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the tweets, they all mention "" goog "", which is Apple's ticker symbol, so that must be the stock we're focusing on: Apple Inc. (AAPL).

Next, for each tweet, I'll separate them into positive and negative factors. Then assess the sentiment of each factor and combine them to see if there's an overall positive or negative impact.

Let me go through each tweet one by one:

1. ""3 amazing iPhone 6 features Android wishes it could match URL via AT_USER $ aapl $ goog $ ssnlf $ chl $ bbry $ msft iphone""
- Positive: It mentions matching Apple's product, which is positive.
- Negative: No negative factors here.

2. ""rt AT_USER mon dieu ! france just banned work e-mails after 6pm , including $ goog , $ fb pwc deloitte URL ( via AT_USER""
- Positive: App mention France banning emails but not sure about the others, could be neutral or positive.
- Negative: No negative factors mentioned.

3. ""are you thinking of investing in $ cpn $ trip $ ges $ goog financialnews URL""
- Positive: Suggesting investment opportunities.
- Negative: No direct negative information.

4. ""$ erbb bid get started here : URL also see $ prpm $ goog $ bbry $ anr""
- Positive: Mentioning a study or event to get started, which is positive.
- Negative: No negatives mentioned.

5. ""would you like great research on stocks $ pdm $ t $ vvc $ goog click URL""
- Positive: Request for research, which can be seen as positive.
- Negative: Not sure about the factors here.

6. ""rt AT_USER apple can't afford an iwatch flop via AT_USER URL iwatch $ aapl $ ssnlf $ goog $ msft $ chl""
- Positive: Mentioning Apple's product but saying it won't go up is negative.
- Negative: No other negative factors mentioned.

7. ""another view of blackberry - more right than wrong . mt AT_USER URL tech mobile $ bbry $ bb.ca $ aapl $ goog""
- Positive: Offering another perspective on Blackbit, which can be seen as positive.
- Negative: Not sure about the sentiment.

8. ""$ goog google to sell glass to bigger pool of consumers URL""
- Positive: Statement about selling products, which is good.
- Negative: No negatives here.

9. ""$ goog google fiber : is google wireless coming soon ? URL""
- Positive: Prediction that wireless services are coming, which can be seen as positive.
- Negative: Not sure if this affects stock price directly.

10. ""AT_USER $ goog should just acquire $ expe or $ trip if they are serious about travel , their own offerings suck to say the least""
- Positive: Suggesting acquisition moves could affect stock performance, which is a good sign.
- Negative: No negative factors mentioned.

11. ""$ altr stocks you might want to buy $ dox $ ohi $ goog financialnews URL""
- Positive: Encouraging buying other stocks suggested by Apple.
- Negative: Not sure about any negatives here.

12. ""$ goog - google fiber : is google wireless coming soon ? -> URL stock stocks stockaction""
- Similar to tweet 9, positive with a prediction of a new service launch.
- Negative: No negative factors mentioned.

13. ""broadcasting sirius xm as a good short | via AT_USER URL $ siri $ lmca $ aapl $ p $ goog""
- Positive: Mentioning a tech company but no clear sentiment towards the stock.
- Negative: Not sure about any negatives here.

14. ""our penny stock newsletter alerts gained 2,100 % in 4 weeks ! subscribe today : URL $ trx $ aapl $ goog""

- Positive: Highlighting a significant increase and encouraging subscription to indicate potential good news for Apple.
- Negative: No negative factors mentioned.

Now, compiling the sentiment from each tweet:

Positive tweets:
- Tweet 1
- Tweet 4
- Tweet 7
- Tweet 10
- Tweet 12
- Tweet 14

Negative tweets:
- Tweet 6
- Tweet 9
- Tweet 3
- Tweet 8

Looking at the positive tweets, several are about research or stock movements. The negative ones have a mix of predictions and unfounded statements.

The majority is positive, but there's an imbalance with some negative factors. However, given that the overall sentiment from both positive and negative tweets includes some strong positive statements like predicting new services and encouraging subscriptions, it leans towards a positive overall impact on Apple's stock."
2014-04-11,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets about the stock prices and determine their impact on the future stock price. The user provided 15 tweets related to Google's (GOOG) stock. My task is to go through each one, assess the factors and sentiment, and then summarize them all to decide if it's positive, neutral, or negative.

First, I'll start by extracting the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first few, they all mention GOOG, so that part is clear. The rest of the tweets provide context or additional info about Google.

For each tweet, I need to separate into Positive and Negative factors. Let's go through them one by one:

1. ""our penny stock newsletter picks gained 2,100 % in 4 weeks ! subscribe today : URL $ trx $ aapl $ goog"" - The user is announcing a newsletter gain but doesn't mention anything negative. So this tweet isn't much of an impact yet.

2. ""AT_USER $ goog is reporting earnings for q1 2014 on 04/16 / 14 – URL"" - Earnings report, which can affect investor sentiment if the company is expected to have good news or bad. But it's just a single tweet without much detail.

3. ""the dumbest apple article award goes to ... URL $ nflx $ goog $ ssnlf $ bbry via AT_USER $ aapl iphone"" - Not related to Google, so this can be ignored for the target stock.

4. ""$ axs stock market reports on stocks like $ clr $ bku $ goog worth a look URL"" - Similar to tweet 1; just announcing a report without any negative info.

5. ""are you hanging on to $ wu $ cost $ wy $ goog investing URL"" - This seems like an offer, so it's positive because investors are looking for the stock now.

6. ""rt AT_USER rt AT_USER what to make of google ’ s latest expansion into hotel listings $ goog $ expe $ pcln $ trip URL"" - Google is expanding into hotels, which can be a positive sign as it might attract new customers and increase demand, potentially leading to higher stock price. So this is positive.

7. ""find out the latest on $ amp $ nke $ tech $ goog view now URL"" - Both AMP and NKE are stocks related to Google (AMP is Apple Inc.), so this could be a negative factor because the company's performance will impact them, but it might not directly affect GOOG itself unless something changes.

8. ""shoud you sell or hold stocks like $ lnkd $ ess $ bokf $ goog worth a look URL"" - Similar to tweet 5; an offer to sell or hold without any negative info. So positive sentiment here too.

9. ""AT_USER $ goog is reporting earnings for q1 2014 on 04/16 / 14 – URL"" - Another earnings report, which could affect the stock. However, it's just a single tweet without details on what they're expecting or any negative comments.

10. ""$ gnw awesome stock research $ wafd $ adp $ goog investing URL"" - Similar to tweet 5; investors are looking for opportunities in Google, so positive.

11. ""are you thinking of investing in $ wrb $ cnk $ goog $ grpn equity URL"" - Another offer, similar to tweet 5 and 8. Positive sentiment here too.

12. ""is it breakout time on $ alk $ cost $ mb $ goog equity URL"" - A keyword related to stock performance. Breakout time is a positive indicator of potential price movement, so this is positive.

13. ""himax : ignore what the soothsayers are saying , and buy on the pullback $ himx $ goog $ googl URL"" - The user suggests buying after pulling back because they're ignoring negative info. This creates pressure for investors to buy, which can be seen as a buy signal. So this is positive.

14. ""rt AT_USER apple can't afford an iwatch flop URL iwatch $ msft $ chl via AT_USER $ aapl $ ssnlf $ goog"" - This tweet seems unrelated, mentioning something about Apple not being able to afford an iPhone, which could be negative if it affects their market position or demand for iPhones. So this is potentially negative.

15. ""$ exp keeping my eye on $ eqix $ gwr $ goog personalfinance URL"" - Another offer, so positive sentiment here.

16. ""$ goog $ nflx $ tsla $ amzn $ pcln $ ibb weekly 1 year chart lots of liquidation URL"" - NFLX is a separate stock from Google; this tweet is unrelated to GOOG and doesn't provide any info about the company. So it's neutral or negative in context but irrelevant.

17. ""AT_USER about $ goog split . not getting much buzz w all the drama . should i sell c shares and buy a shares ? keep both ? tx"" - The user is offering to buy both call (c) and put (a) stocks, which might be attractive if the market is favorable for buying at a discount. This seems like an offer to buy, so positive sentiment.

Now, summarizing each tweet's impact:

1-4: Not significant or no info.
5: Positive offer.
6: Positive expansion in hotel business leading to higher stock value.
7: Negative as related to AMP and NKE, but could be neutral if not impacting GOOG directly.
8: Positive offer.
9: Earnings report, which might affect the stock positively if expected.
10-12: Positive offers for Google's opportunities.
13: Buy signal after pullback, positive sentiment.
14: Negative tweet about Apple, potentially negative impact on Google's performance.
15: Positive offer for another unrelated stock.
17: Positive buy offers for stocks.

Overall, most tweets are either offers (positive) or minor reports (neutral). The one with the negative tweet about Apple might swing it slightly negatively, but overall sentiment seems to be leaning towards positive because of the offers and some supportive words like ""pullback"" and buys. So the overall impact is likely positive."
2014-04-12,Negative,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about a company's stock and determine their impact on the future stock price.

First, I need to identify each tweet as positive or negative based on the information given. Let me go through them one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions ""top stocks today . find out why."" It seems like it's providing information, so maybe neutral.
2. Second tweet is about ""latest earnings info on $ dtv $ gis $ cvi $ goog moneymanagement URL."" Earnings info can affect stock price positively, but since it doesn't specify whether it's good or bad, it might be a mix of positive and negative. But I'm not sure yet.
3. Third tweet talks about ""whats going on with $ bwa $ lm $ cpn $ goog money URL."" It sounds like speculative news without context, so probably neutral.
4. Fourth tweet is ""do you need stock research on $ rs $ ba $ clx $ goog wallstreet URL."" Stock research can be a good indicator of future performance, so positive sentiment here.
5. Fifth tweet is about ""insider trading updates on $ fb $ rost $ mtb $ goog stockmarket URL."" Insider trading usually affects prices negatively because it introduces uncertainty, so negative impact.
6. Sixth tweet asks if someone is looking for more winners like $ eqr $ enr $ nflx $ goog financialnews URL. It's a call to action without specific info on outcome, so neutral or maybe mixed.
7. Seventh tweet suggests considering selling $ inta $ pld $ swn $ goog click URL. Selling stock can be seen as negative because it reduces exposure, but the term ""click"" is ambiguous and not specific enough for sureness.
8. Eighth tweet says ""buy or sell ? $ ggp $ enr $ bku $ goog financialnews URL."" The prompt here isn't clear on what action to take; hence, neutral.
9. Ninth tweet offers free research on $ lstr $ gnw $ mdr $ goog money URL. Free information is generally positive as it can provide valuable insights.
10. Tenth tweet says ""looking for the next winners like $ vc $ cpn $ hfc $ goog give it a try URL."" It's another call to action, so mixed or neutral.
11. Twelfth tweet is about bearish sentiment towards these stocks: $ chd $ aapl $ ed $ goog overvalued URL. Overvalued information usually reduces investor confidence and can be negative.

Now, let me tally up each tweet:

- Neutral tweets: 1, 3, 6, 8, 9, 10. That's six.
- Positive tweets: 4, 7, 9 (since the suggestion to buy or sell is neutral in this context). So three positive tweets.
- Negative tweets: 2, 5, 11, 12. Four negative tweets.

Adding up the positive and negative, I have a net of +3 (positive) and -4 (negative), which overall leans towards negative impact on the stock price because there are more negative tweets than positive ones."
2014-04-13,Neutral,"Alright, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a given company. The user provided eight tweets and asked me to determine if each is positive, neutral, or negative for their likely effect on the stock price.

First, I'll go through each tweet one by one. But wait, I don't have the exact stock symbol yet. Maybe I can figure that out from one of them. Let's see, the first tweet mentions $ wynn $ mbi $ pc $ goog financial URL. Hmm, ""wynn mbi pc goog"" might be a misspelling or a specific term related to the company. Maybe it's a typo for ""Wynnet Inc."" or something else? I'll have to keep that in mind as I analyze.

Now, looking at each tweet:

1. ""do you need stock research on $ wynn $ mbi $ pc $ goog financial URL"". The term "" goog financial URL"" doesn't seem standard. Maybe this is a typo. If it's about Google and their financial status or something related to a specific company, but without more context, it's hard to tell. I'll keep in mind that the user might be talking about Google.

2. ""$ goog google inc . ' s android tv could fail URL"". This seems like a news article mentioning something related to Google's Android TV and whether it might fail. If there's uncertainty or potential issues with an upcoming product, that could lead to negative sentiment because investors are uncertain about the company's future performance.

3. "" insider trading alerts on $ wab $ sjm $ cma $ goog nasdaq URL"". Here, the mention of insider trading suggests high risk and potential negative news. Insider trading can increase investor concern and may lead to a drop in stock price.

4. ""are you hanging on to $ csl $ ua $ krc $ goog financial URL"". The question is about whether someone is holding onto Google's stock. If they're saying no, it might indicate uncertainty or fear of missing out, which could be seen as negative.

5. ""rt AT_USER "" most visited website by country "" - $ goog $ fb baidu rt AT_USER AT_USER URL"". This tweet seems repetitive, talking about the most visited site and mentioning specific platforms like Facebook and Baidu. It's unclear what this means for Google, but repeated mentions of a trend could lead to negative sentiment if it affects investor perception.

6. Same as tweet 5: ""rt AT_USER "" most visited website by country "" - $ goog $ fb baidu rt AT_USER AT_USER URL"". Again, the same info is being repeated. This repetition might cause confusion or fear among investors, leading to a potential negative impact on the stock price.

7. ""$ cvi $ cr $ kro $ goog equity URL"". This tweet mentions a company called CVI, CR, KRO, and Google's stock. If these are related to Google's products or services, this could be positive because it's about the company itself. However, if they're unrelated, it might not have much impact.

8. ""flappy bird ' refuses to die , still popular teen game URL ibdblogs via AT_USER $ aapl $ goog $ ntdoy $ king $ znga"". This tweet discusses Flappy Bird, which is a mobile game, but links it to a site. It also mentions that the site is still popular among teens, perhaps referencing an app or platform. Since it's about a game and its popularity, it could be neutral as it might not directly impact Google's stock price unless there's a hidden connection.

9. ""$ goog - market snapshot : google , intel , ibm outlooks to trump earnings results URL"". This tweet is a market analysis saying that Google is looking ahead to their earnings before the earnings report of Trump. This could indicate investor confidence or concern about future performance, which might be positive if it shows excitement or caution.

Now, combining all these tweets:

- Tweet 1: If it's about Google financials or products, it might have a negative impact if uncertain.
- Tweets 2 and 5/6: Repetitive with uncertainty, leading to negative sentiment.
- Tweet 3: High risk of insider trading, which can be negative.
- Tweet 4: Fear of missing out could be negative.
- Tweet 7: If it's about Google's services or products, positive; if related elsewhere, neutral.
- Tweet 8: References a game but not directly to Google. Neutral?
- Tweet 9: Outlook on earnings, which can indicate future performance and thus impact stock price positively.

Overall, the sentiment seems mixed with some negative tweets (2,3,4,5/6,7). The others might be more positive or neutral. It's hard to decide without exact context but leaning towards a mix of some negative factors."
2014-04-14,Negative,"Okay, I need to figure out the likely impact on the stock price based on these tweets. Let me start by going through each tweet one by one and analyze their factors.

1. The first tweet mentions a Google purchase of Titan Aerospace, which is positive. That's good news.
2. The second tweet talks about a stock research site visiting multiple companies. This might be a distraction but could provide valuable information.
3. Third tweet advises not to miss out on Google's liquidity opportunities. Negative factor because losing money can hurt stock price.
4. Fourth tweet asks for more investment winners, which is good for diversification.
5. Fifth tweet says YouTube's scale has potential for Google's music fortunes. Positive as it could boost YouTube's performance.
6. Sixth tweet mentions NASDAQ trimming gains and becoming negative. That’s a bearish outlook overall.
7. Seventh tweet suggests Google is launching space services to meet demand. Positive, expanding into new areas might benefit the company.
8. Eighth tweet asks for more winners like WMB and SPLS, which could help diversify investments.
9. Ninth tweet says Google disrespects lobbying, which can influence policies but not directly with the tweets.
10. Tenth tweet is about Altr's best research on stocks. This seems unrelated to stock performance.
11. Eleventh tweet advises holding or adding to HST, WHR, SC, or GOG. Neutral as it doesn't mention anything negative.
12. Twelfth tweet asks why top stocks are trading at certain prices. Just gathering info, no direct impact on price.
13. Thirteenth tweet suggests why to hold or add to EQUITY ETFs. Again, no indication of stock performance.
14. Fourteenth tweet offers reasons for liquidity and asks about future splits. Not directly related to current stock.
15. Fifteenth tweet is bearish regarding some stocks. Negative as it could affect investor sentiment negatively.
16. Sixteenth tweet mentions Google buying Facebook's drone maker, which was its previous target. Positive shift in focus areas.
17. Seventeenth tweet suggests Google's disruption of the travel industry outlook is ins uninspiring. Negative, as it affects their future performance.
18. Eighteenth tweet says Intel's outlook might be negative for Q1. This is a short-term concern that could impact overall stock.
19. Nineteenth tweet provides info on financial news about $COS. Positive info that can influence the market.
20. Twentieth tweet talks about Google testing a way to follow someone to the mall. Neutral as no direct impact.

Now, combining these factors: positive events like the drone purchase and expanding into space are good. However, negative points come from NASDAQ being negative, Intel outlook, and financial info that might be neutral. The bearish outlook on NASDAQ and the shift in focus areas could push investor sentiment down. The overall sentiment seems to have some positives but also significant negatives.

So, I'm leaning towards a mixed result because there are both good developments (drone purchase, space expansion) and negative factors ( NASdaq, Intel outlook)."
2014-04-15,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and figure out if they're positive, negative, or neutral in terms of their impact on stock prices for a given company. The user provided a list of ten tweets, each with specific factors and some mentions of companies. Let me go through each one step by step.

Starting with the first tweet: ""$ goog ' drone wars ' taking off as tech giants fight on new battleground URL."" Hmm, this seems like it's about the competition between tech firms, specifically mentioning drones. I know that drone technology is growing and could be a big industry, so if Google is involved in fighting them, maybe there are some competitive developments. But since it's more about potential movements rather than direct stock changes, I'm not sure yet.

Second tweet: ""why amazon's smartphone is no threat to apple URL via AT_USER $ aapl $ amzn $ bbry $ goog $ msft."" This seems like comparing the risks of Amazon's smartphones against Apple. Both are major brands, so this could affect investor sentiment but maybe not in a very polarizing way. Some might see Amazon as a potential threat or competitor.

Third tweet: ""shoud you sell or hold stocks like $ vnta $ goog $ cme $ aapl liquidity URL."" This looks like it's suggesting that selling certain stocks based on their liquidity, which is a broad term. Liquidity can affect investor sentiment; if many investors are selling because they think the stock isn't going to trade easily, maybe that's good for them.

Fourth tweet: ""$ goog - google buys drone maker titan aerospace -> URL stock stocks stockaction."" This is a buy announcement, so it's definitely positive for Google. Buy announcements usually boost stock prices and increase investor confidence in a company.

Fifth tweet: ""$ goog iPhone 6 leak seems to confirm a much larger screen is coming URL."" If rumors about an upcoming iPhone model are confirmed, especially if they indicate increased display size or features, this could signal growth in the tech sector. More info can be good for investors.

Sixth tweet: ""$ goog : twitter hires google maps executive to lead product group URL."" This seems like a recruitment move by Twitter to hire Google's maps person into their product team. While that might boost Twitter and perhaps have some positive effects on its competitors, especially if Google is valued highly, it could also be seen as a strategic move rather than necessarily a direct stock impact.

Seventh tweet: ""are you thinking of selling $ goog $ aet $ acm $ s goto URL."" Similar to the first tweet, this is about potential movements in the tech sector. It doesn't directly mention stock actions but points towards an industry being competitive, which could affect sentiment.

Eighth tweet: ""$ goog - zebra to buy motorola solutions enterprise business - - update URL."" Another buy announcement by Google buying a competitor. Buy announcements can both boost and sometimes hurt depending on the company's performance and other factors in the market. If Zebra is well-positioned and profitable, this could be positive.

Ninth tweet: ""$ goog : samsung mulled using google to attack apple URL."" This suggests that Samsung is considering how Google might affect Apple's operations. It's a bit vague but could imply that Google has strategic interests within the tech landscape. This might not directly impact stock prices unless there's a significant shift in priorities.

Tenth tweet: ""do you need stock research on $ csl $ ben $ te $ goog overvalued URL."" Again, comparing stock performance to an external factor (overvalued). Stock research can influence price movements, but without concrete information or positive news, it might not be enough to significantly impact the stock.

Eleventh tweet: ""get pennystock research on $ bwc $ jazz $ amcx $ goog view now URL."" Similar to the previous ones, this is about getting stock research done. It's more of a suggestion to do something, which can sometimes encourage investors but doesn't have a direct effect on price unless it leads them to make investments.

Twelfth tweet: ""ready to walk around with $ 1500 on your face ? URL $ goog."" This seems like a joke or a playful statement. The number seems arbitrary, and the location is also unspecified. It's more of a commentary than an actual news event affecting stock prices.

Thirteenth tweet: ""should you buy , sell or hold $ rmd $ mnst $ ahl $ goog overvalued URL."" Again, about buying, selling, or holding stocks based on perceived value. If overvaluation is expected, this could lead to higher stock prices if people believe in the value of the company.

Fourteenth tweet: ""stocks you might want to buy $ lyb $ wtw $ crs $ goog check out URL"" – Wait, I notice a missing factor here. It mentions stocks (like stocks you might want to buy), but it seems like the factors are cut off or incomplete. This is confusing and could lead to incorrect analysis.

Now, putting it all together: There are several positive points like Google buying other companies, Zebra buying competitors, Samsung considering strategic moves, and Samsung's stock research. These seem like they would likely positively influence investor sentiment. However, there are also some negative points like potential market movements, recruitment efforts by Twitter, and the number in the tweet being arbitrary. The lack of a clear overall trend without more context makes it hard to decide definitively.

But given that Google is involved in multiple significant purchases and that this could signal broader tech growth, even if other factors are at play, I think there's some positive potential here."
2014-04-16,Negative,"Okay, I need to figure out the likely impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company based on the provided information. Let's go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet mentions ""not now"" and says ""come on!"", which sounds like encouragement but not necessarily negative.
2. The second tweet talks about increased traffic acquisition costs, which could indicate higher expenses but might suggest that earnings are up or more profitable.
3. Third tweet is a call to action for someone considering buying several stocks: $ duk, $ cprt, etc., which could be a signal for buy orders.
4. Fourth tweet mentions stock check out URL and suggests buying or selling. Could mean buy pressure or sell signals.
5. Fifth tweet talks about wearable devices at work and shares of AT_USER's products. This might indicate a shift in consumer behavior affecting the company, perhaps positive if it aligns with trends.
6. Sixth tweet discusses profits rising but stock falling because gains fell below expectations. Negative impact due to investor concerns.
7. Seventh tweet is a reaction to earnings report with a 5% drop, which could show investors' reactions and could be a buy signal.
8. Eighth tweet mentions liquidity being down, so maybe sell pressure or negative sentiment.
9. Ninth tweet lists upcoming stocks, suggesting a positive outlook on these companies.
10. Tenth tweet continues the list of stockwatching, possibly indicating that the company is still in the game but with some uncertainty.
11. Twelfth tweet links Google to buzzwords like buzz stocks and mentions blackberry and others. This might signal excitement or interest in their products.
12. Thirteenth tweet provides more info on Google's shares, which could be a positive factor if there are new developments.
13. Fourth tweet is about Dow jumping by 100 points due to opening higher. This indicates market confidence, possibly positive for the stock.
14. Fifth tweet mentions information on specific companies like ESUV, Pru, Q, and Google. Maybe this could be a buy signal if they're strategic moves.
15. Twentieth tweet reports earnings for 2014 but misses estimates. If it's below expectations, it could indicate negative sentiment due to missing targets.
16. Twelfth tweet talks about market timing on specific stocks. Could mean selling if the company is not performing well yet.
17. Twelfth tweet is a follow-up on Marissa Mayer's performance in 2014 and asks about the stock. If she's doing well, it could be positive sentiment.
18. Twentieth tweet suggests Google missed earnings estimates but has already met revenue goals. This might mean that while expectations were high, actual results are sufficient, possibly neutral to slightly positive.
19. Twenty-first tweet reports lower earnings growth and shares down 5%, which is a direct impact on stock price—negative.
20. Twentieth tweet mentions AT_USER reports 6.27 eps against 6.41 est for Q1. This could indicate recent performance, possibly negative if expectations were high but actual results are below estimates.

Putting it all together: The tweets show mixed sentiment with some positive aspects like earnings misses or new product launches and some negative ones about stock valuations. The overall impact seems neutral because while there's a mix of buy/sell signals, the broader market reactions aren't overwhelmingly positive or negative."
2014-04-17,Negative,"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine the impact of these tweets on a given company's stock price and then conclude whether it's positive, neutral, or negative.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. It looks like some of them mention ""goog"" which is the ticker symbol for Google. So, my focus will be on how these tweets affect Google's stock price.

Now, looking at each tweet one by one:

1. Tweets 1 through 3 don't mention a specific company but talk about Google-related topics.
2. Tweets 4 and 5 discuss earnings, specifically Google's profits. There's an update saying the price increased and their revenue grows.
3. Tweets 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 are all about Google's earnings. They mention that analysts think profit margins might fall as they expand operations or report results.
4. Tweets 12 talks about a poll result for Google, but it doesn't provide any direct information on the stock price.
5-8: Some tweets mention analyst comments on Google's performance, especially in terms of profit margins and revenue growth.
6. Tweets 9 and 10 discuss earnings reports from Google, including revenue and net income figures.
7-10: Many tweets are about Google, either directly or indirectly mentioning it.
8: This tweet also mentions Google but talks about other companies like IPG.
9: Focuses on Google's financial performance metrics.
10: Talks about market trends in global companies, not specifically Google.
11: Discusses earnings and market shadow.
12: Poll result for Google.
13-16: All tweets are about Google or other unrelated topics.
14-17: These are analyst comments on Google's performance, focusing on profit margins.
18-20: Talks about Google's stock performance without specific price changes.
21-25: Discusses other companies' earnings and stock prices.
26: Earnings call transcript for Google.
27-30: Talks about other unrelated stocks.

So, most tweets are either discussing Google's financials or analyst comments on its performance. The key information is that several tweets indicate that analysts believe Google will have lower profit margins than expected because they're expanding and the market expects higher costs. There's an attempt to suggest that despite earnings reports, stock prices might fall due to this outlook.

Putting it all together, the overall sentiment seems negative because there are warnings about profits dropping compared to estimates. Investors seem concerned, which can lead to a decrease in stock price."
2014-04-18,Positive,"Okay, I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the given company. The user has provided 23 tweets and wants me to analyze them step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Let's go through each one:

1. stocks you might want to sell cab dox act goog must have URL
   - Not sure about this one; no obvious stock symbol here.

22. avoid mistakes like wsm itc pf goog wallstreet url
    - No stock.

23. in tech, the war of all against all has become the war of all against one, and that one is google : goog URL
    - Google again.

So, from these tweets, I can identify that Google is the primary target company here based on multiple mentions like tweet 14 and 17, and other tweets discuss Google's stock performance. There are no clear individual stocks listed in any of these tweets.

Now, considering each tweet: some mention research strategies or analysis (tweets 2, 8, 9, etc.), others talk about price targets (tweets 17), and a few give warnings or opinions on investing (tweets 3,6,10,12). 

Looking at the factors:

Positive factors include research, price targeting, and investor opinion. Negative factors are mostly nothing.

Assessing sentiment: All tweets seem to support Google as the company, with some discussing its performance. There's no mention of other companies or negative aspects related to them.

Overall sentiment seems positive because most tweets are about Google's stock and don't indicate any negative events or concerns. The user might be looking for trends like stock movements, buy/sell signals, or analysis reports."
2014-04-19,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets about Google's stock and determine whether they're positive, neutral, or negative. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol from all the tweets: goog. So I'm focusing on how each tweet affects the future of $ goog. 

Starting with the first tweet: ""the $ goog play market is helping developers around the world - paying out 4x in 2013 compared y / y URL."" Hmm, this one mentions that Google's stock price has been increasing by four times over the past year compared to last year, and it's affecting developers. That sounds positive because higher stock prices generally boost investor confidence. So I'll mark this as positive.

Second tweet: ""free research on $ goog $ wtm $ o $ s must have URL."" It talks about free research related to Google products or services, which usually indicates investment interest. Free research can attract more investors, leading to positive sentiment here too.

Third tweet: ""rt AT_USER google isn''t growing . here are the charts that prove it . $ goog AT_USER AT_USER URL."" This one says that Google's growth is not happening and provides some charts to support that. While there's a bit of skepticism but with evidence, this can still be seen as neutral because investors might remain cautious about any impending issues.

Fourth tweet: ""$ chs considering investing in $ snps $ act $ goog financialnews URL."" This tweet mentions potential investments in Google related to financial news. Financial investment is generally positive for the company, so I'll mark this as positive.

Fifth tweet: ""$ goog : 3 ways google glass is changing the future of medicine URL."" This suggests that Google's product (Glass) has a significant impact on medical advancements. A positive impact would boost stock prices, so I'll rate this as positive.

Sixth tweet: ""are you investing in $ lgf $ bby $ aiv $ goog wealthmanagement URL."" Similar to the fourth one, it mentions potential investments related to Google's financial services. Wealth management is a positive area for investors, so this will be considered positive.

Putting it all together: The first, second, and fifth tweets are definitely positive because they mention increased stock prices or strategic investments. The third tweet is neutral with some skepticism but the data suggests uncertainty. The fourth and sixth tweets are also positive as they indicate financial investment opportunities. So overall, most of these tweets show a positive outlook for $ goog."
2014-04-20,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how these tweets are affecting the stock price of some company. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify each tweet and extract the relevant stocks mentioned. Looking at the tweets:

1. ""woof todays movers to research $ inta $ itc $ goog personalfinance URL""
2. ""toys should watch $ ajg $ vrsk $ ctxs $ goog wealthmanagement URL""
3. ""rt AT_USER disappointing to see lazy wall st analysis of $ goog . here is a more nuanced way to understand their long term oppty . URL""
4. ""kr insider trading updates on $ has $ wtm $ goog singedinvestor URL""
5. Same as tweet 3: ""rt AT_USER disappointed to see lazy wall st analysis of $ goog . here is a more nuanced way to understand their long term oppty . URL""
6. ""are looking to buy $ ingr $ hts $ goog wallstreet URL""

So the key stocks involved are inta, itc, goog, ajg, vrsk, ctxs, and ingr. 

Next, I need to analyze each tweet for positive or negative factors. Let's go through them one by one.

1. ""woof todays movers to research $ inta $ itc $ goog personalfinance URL"" - The first tweet seems to be a commentary on the stock market trends and could have some positive sentiment if it highlights growth or future expectations, but the wording feels negative towards Wall Street.

2. ""toys should watch $ ajg $ vrsk $ ctxs $ goog wealthmanagement URL"" - This looks like an investment tip focused on wealth management, which is generally a positive sign for investors looking to grow their wealth, so this could be positive.

3. ""rt AT_USER disappointing to see lazy wall st analysis of $ goog . here is a more nuanced way to understand their long term oppty . URL"" - The user mentions that the wall street analysis is more nuanced and future-oriented, which suggests that the user finds it helpful or beneficial for their investment strategy, so this tweet is positive.

4. ""kr insider trading updates on $ has $ wtm $ goog singedinvestor URL"" - This clearly mentions insider trading activities, which can be seen as a negative indicator because it's related to potential risks in trading, so this could contribute negatively.

5. Same as tweet 3: another negative sentiment about the analysis being more nuanced. So again, positive for the user.

6. ""are looking to buy $ ingr $ hts $ goog wallstreet URL"" - This is an investment tip focusing on company performance and growth potential, which is a positive sign for buying stock, so this tweet is positive.

Now, assessing each tweet's sentiment:

1. The tweet seems to express opinions or analysis but without clear positive or negative cues; the tone could be neutral because it's not explicitly stating a favorable or unfavorable opinion.
2. Positive because it's an investment tip focused on wealth management.
3. Positive due to the user's suggestion of more nuanced analysis, which is helpful for investors.
4. Negative as it mentions insider trading, a risk factor.
5. Same as tweet 3, positive.
6. Positive for the same reason as tweet 2.

Combining all these, I have mostly positive tweets (tweets 2, 3, 5) and two negative ones (tweets 1 and 4). However, some of them are more about analysis than explicit sentiment indicators. The majority leans towards a positive overall sentiment because most tweets are supportive or informative for investors, even if one is slightly negative."
2014-04-21,Negative,"Okay, I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company based on the given criteria. The user has provided 19 tweets and wants me to analyze them step by step.

First, I'll identify each tweet's target stock symbol. It seems they're all around ""goog,"" so it's probably Google. Now, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. 

Looking at the first few tweets:
1. Positive: Google is launching office space, which might boost revenue.
2. Negative: The user isn't selling real estate yet.
3. Negative: They're criticizing Wall Street analysis.
4. Neutral: They don't want to lose money from their investments.
5. Negative: Research on stocks and other companies.
6. Positive: Potential breakout opportunity.
7. Positive: Small-cap stocks in good shape.
8. Neutral: Quora research but not sure about Google's performance.
9. Positive: Considering joining a list of smartphone prices being lowered.
10. Positive: Competitors like Amazon might join, affecting prices.
11. Positive: Google's search data predicting TV shows' votes.
12. Positive: Google is being bought by other companies.
13. Neutral or Negative? The user wants to hold research on AMD and others.
14. Positive: An article about toll roads in value companies.
15. Positive: Corporate therapy for Silicon Valley.
16. Positive: Latest updates on mass, TMobile, and Alphabet.
17. Positive: Pennystock research onAXP, CBM, MCHP,goog.
18. Neutral: seeking similar stocks.
19. Negative: Decrease in atm IV scores across multiple platforms.

Now, assessing sentiment for each tweet:
- Positives likely indicate positive factors that could boost the stock.
- Negatives suggest negative or neutral impacts.

Looking at all 19 tweets, several are clearly positive (tweets 1-5, 7, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18). But some like tweet 12 and 18 seem a bit off. 

However, the majority of them either support Google's potential for gains or indicate that other companies are being bought up by Alphabet. This could drive up Alphabet's price.

But wait, I need to make sure if these tweets are all about Google or if they're part of a broader trend. Also, tweet 13 is ambiguous—whether the user wants to hold AMD research. That could lead to uncertainty rather than clear sentiment.

Considering the overall positive factors (like upcoming office space, potential competition, stock buys), and that the negative tweets seem minor in number, the sentiment leans slightly positive."
2014-04-22,Negative,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me start by breaking down the process step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking through the list, it seems like all tweets are talking about Google-related stocks or related topics like drones, apps, financial services, etc. But wait, none of them specify which stock directly. That might be a problem because without knowing exactly which stock we're looking at, I can't evaluate its performance.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. The target stock isn't explicitly mentioned in the tweets. That's a red flag. If the target stock is unknown or not specified, it makes analyzing the impact difficult. Without knowing which specific stock we're discussing, I can't assess whether it's positively, neutrally, or negatively affected.

I think I need to consider that each tweet might be referring to a different stock, and without knowing which one, I can't make accurate judgments. But perhaps the problem assumes all tweets are about the same company, though not explicitly stated here. Or maybe each tweet is independent of each other in terms of their focus on Google or related companies.

If I proceed under the assumption that each tweet might be referring to a different stock, but without knowing which one it is, I can't determine the overall impact on any specific stock. That complicates things because each tweet could be positive, negative, or neutral towards its respective stock independently.

Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in not specifying the target stock. Without that information, my analysis would be incomplete. However, since the instructions require me to generate an output based solely on the given data without additional context, I have to make do with what I can gather.

Perhaps each tweet is about Google and its derivatives or related products. For instance, some tweets mention drones, other stocks, etc. But without knowing which one, I can't assess the impact. Alternatively, maybe all tweets are part of a conversation around the stock market trends in general, affecting the overall market rather than a specific stock.

Another angle is that these tweets might collectively indicate positive or negative trends towards Google itself. For example, if multiple tweets mention Google's performance, their collective sentiment could influence the stock price. But again, without knowing which specific stock it refers to, I can't be certain.

I'm stuck because each tweet lacks a target stock symbol. Maybe I need to infer based on common keywords or patterns. The words like ""goog"", ""amzn"", ""nse"", etc., appear frequently, so perhaps these are all related to Google. But again, without the exact stock, it's hard to assess.

In summary, since each tweet is about a different stock but doesn't specify which one, and given that some tweets seem to be discussing broader market trends affecting multiple stocks collectively, I might assume they're part of a larger trend analysis rather than individual stock movements. However, without knowing the exact stock or the context provided in these tweets, it's impossible to determine their impact on any specific stock.

Maybe the user intended for each tweet to refer to the same stock, but it's missing here. If I were to make an educated guess based on trends, some tweets mention making money via apps, while others talk about losses or avoiding mistakes like losing investments. But without knowing which stock is being referred to in each tweet, this analysis isn't feasible.

I think the best approach is to inform the user that without the target stock symbol identified from these tweets, it's impossible to determine the overall impact on any specific stock. Therefore, my conclusion would be [Neutral] because I can't assess sentiment based on missing information."
2014-04-23,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of the given company. The task is to decide if each tweet is positive, neutral, or negative by breaking down each tweet's factors and sentiment.

First, I need to extract the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first few tweets, it seems like they all mention ""GOOG,"" so the target stock must be Google. So, every tweet revolves around the company with the symbol GOOG.

Next, for each tweet, I should separate the factors into positive and negative. For example, in tweet 1, the person is researching $KBR on KFC, but that doesn't seem directly related to GOOG. Similarly, in some tweets, the words like ""option,"" ""implied volatility"" are mentioned, which don't pertain to GOOG.

Then, I have to assess the sentiment of each tweet. Sentiment can be positive if it's encouraging the stock, negative if discouraging it, and neutral if not affecting much. For instance, tweets that provide information about earnings or stock performance might show positive or negative sentiments based on the message.

After analyzing each tweet, I'll summarize their overall impact on GOOG. If most are positive, it's a positive overall sentiment. If there's an equal mix of positives and negatives, it's neutral. If more negatives, then negative.

Let me go through them one by one:
1. No mention of GOOG or its performance.
2. Talks about volatility but doesn't specify expectations on the stock.
3. Subscription offer for Gemini's newsletter. Not related to Google.
4. Free research on Ernie and Apple Inc.
5. Offering to try a product from DPi's company.
6. Discussing casualties of the wearables wars, not relevant.
7. Selling a thermostat app on Google Play.
8. Trying out products on Amazon tablet.
9. GM's investment in renewable energy projects.
10. Grandpa discovering books, no mention of GOOG.
11. Statement about a merged company announcement.
12. Comments on bearish sentiment for other stocks.
13. Negative outlook on several tech stocks, including Google.
14. Merged companies thought to open new opportunities.
15. Stock investment advice.
16. Bearish comment on some stocks.
17. Comparing earnings expectations.
18. Investment ideas from RTX stock.
19. Stock investment offers.
20. Looking for winners.
21. Stock investment idea.

Now, looking at these, tweet 9 mentions GM investing in renewable energy. This could affect GOOG's performance because renewable energy is a major sector and might impact GM's earnings. Similarly, tweets 13, 16, and 20 are about bearish sentiments on certain stocks, which would influence GOOG.

But some tweets don't talk directly about GOOG or its performance. For example, tweet 5 talks about DPi, not GM. So there aren't direct positive or negative indicators about GOOG's stock price.

However, since GM is related to renewable energy and that's a significant industry, the positive tweet (tweet 9) might have some indirect effect on GOOG. But the lack of clear mentions of GOOG performance makes it hard to assess definitively.

Overall, considering all these factors, while there are some tweets that suggest potential for GOOG to perform well or not, without concrete information about GOOG's current situation or financial health, the impact is ambiguous."
2014-04-24,Negative,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about Google's stock performance and decide if they're positive, neutral, or negative. I'm not very familiar with all these stocks and terms, but I'll do my best.

Starting with the first tweet: ""$ goog - google plus head gundotra leaves after 8 years at search engine."" Hmm, ""gundotra"" sounds like a username. It says the person left Google after 8 years. That seems negative because it's talking about losing company ownership. That could be a red flag for investors.

Second tweet: ""dont want to lose like you did with $ oc $ ci $ pre $ goog financialnews URL."" They're saying they don't want to lose money and compared to something called ""financialnews"". I'm not sure what those terms mean, but the idea is about avoiding losses. That sounds negative.

Third tweet: ""$ stock market reports you need on $ fdx $ dish $ sm $ goog wealthmanagement URL."" It's asking for stock market updates but mentions wealthmanagement. That might imply that the company doesn't trust them or has a biased view.

Fourth tweet: ""stocks you migh want to sell $ pf $ usm $ hpq $ goog worth a look URL."" They're selling stocks and saying they value them. That sounds like a positive action because it's taking something away, which can be good for investors.

Fifth tweet: ""$ google stock forecast URL $. Probably just repeating or implying that Google's performance is expected somehow.""

Sixth tweet: ""predict on $ goog : URL / / / google + chief vic gundotra leaving company URL."" It mentions the CEO leaving. That could be a big negative because it might affect investor confidence.

Seventh tweet: ""$ goog - sorry , but google glass isn ’ t actually for sale to everybody yet -> URL stock stocks stockaction."" It's correcting something about Google Glass and saying it's not available everywhere. This seems like a positive move by the company, signaling they're aware of the issue or managing expectations.

Eighth tweet: ""$ goog : time travel : google maps now allow a look back URL."" They're talking about investing in the past through Google Maps, which is speculative and could be seen as optimistic because it's using technology for something else.

Ninth tweet: ""$ goog - larry page tried to sell google for $ 1.6 million — $ 358 billion less ... -> URL stock stocks stockaction."" This sounds like a sale offer, possibly aggressive. It might push the stock higher.

Tenth tweet: ""google stock forecast URL $. Probably just saying Google's performance is expected somehow.""

Eleventh tweet: ""$ goog - google + chief vic gundotra departs - - update URL."" Another CEO leaving announcement. That could be another negative because it affects investor sentiment by revealing a change in management.

Twelfth tweet: ""why did you only drop aws pricing after $ goog did ? ' lol - ever hear of a price war ? $ amzn cloud biz is in trouble ."". It's talking about dropping AWS prices and wondering if there was a price war with Amazon. That sounds like it could be negative because it might indicate that Google's stock performance isn't as strong as expected, or maybe the company is in the news for something bad.

Thirteenth tweet: ""$ bidu $ yndx $ goog a comparative analysis of the three search giants . URL bullish."" Comparing Google to other search companies. That suggests confidence in their performance, which could be positive.

Fourteenth tweet: ""stock watchlist you should be looking at $ aep $ udr $ eat $ goog moneymanagement URL."" They're suggesting stocks to invest in and mention money management. It's a strategic action for investors, which is positive because it helps the company attract buyers.

Fifteenth tweet: ""$ goog high open interest range is 530.00 to 1155.00 for option expiration 04/25 / 2014 . URL"". They're talking about options with a specific expiration date and mentioning an increase in open interest, which might affect stock price. It's speculative and could be either positive or negative depending on the context.

Sixteenth tweet: ""$ whr top performing stocks today $ amp $ adt $ goog personalfinance unknown_error"". They're ranking stocks but mention unknown error about personalfinance. That sounds like a data point indicating uncertainty, which could be negative because it's less trustworthy information.

Seventeenth tweet: ""rt AT_USER disappointing tosee lazy wallst analysis of $ goog . a more nuanced way to understand their longtermoppty -> URL"". They're referring to an analysis from Wall Street and comparing it to their own opinions. That might imply that the company is not keeping up with their own research, which could be negative.

Eighteenth tweet: ""$ goog - apple , google , others settle wage-fixing suit -> URL stock stocks stockaction."" They're mentioning a settlement where companies like Apple agree on wage increases. That's a negative sign because it shows cooperation and might indicate that the company is handling things well.

Now, putting this all together. There are some positive tweets about Google Glass, improving their business, and doing price analysis. But there are several negative tweets about losing ownership, losing money, employees leaving, speculative news like AWS prices or personalfinance data. The overall sentiment seems a bit mixed but leaning more towards neutral because there's both good (positive) and bad (negative) signals."
2014-04-25,Negative,"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I have to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a given company. The user provided specific steps and tweet content, so my task is to evaluate each tweet's factors and sentiments.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. It seems like several tweets mention ""goog,"" which makes me think the company in question is Google. So, I'll focus on these tweets for the analysis.

Next, for each tweet, I have to separate Positive and Negative factors. But since all the tweets are about Google-related topics, it might be a bit challenging to extract individual factors from each. Maybe I can categorize them based on their content related to Google or unrelated topics but still relevant to investors.

For each tweet, I'll assess whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. That includes looking for language that conveys approval (positive), disapproval (negative), or neutrality. Sentiment analysis might involve checking words like ""great,"" ""good news,"" ""bad news,"" etc., and how they translate into positive or negative.

Looking at the tweets:

1. Focus on ""best pennystock research $ cah $ tmk $ tdw $ goog view now URL."" This seems neutral, just listing factors without specific sentiment.
2. ""are you considering selling $ krc $ gci $ crm $ goog nse URL"" – this is about selling stock, which is negative for investors but not sure if that's the primary factor.
3. Similar to tweet 1, it's a list of factors without sentiment.
4. ""AT_USER rt $ aapl algo setup for today apr . 25 , 2014 t / s : sell , p / t : 555 nexttrade stocks $ pcln $ amzn $ goog $ tsla $ fb $ bidu $ spy $ nflx $ qqq"" – mentions selling stock, which is negative.
5. ""do you need stock research on $ nee $ dis $ omc $ goog visit URL"" – again, about selling stock, negative sentiment.
6. ""are you considering selling $ luk $ kar $ bg $ goog personalfinance URL"" – same as tweet 2 and 3; selling stock is negative.
7. "" goog : worlds first video-game stadium , coming to macaus neighborhood URL"" – no specific news related to Google, but mentions a new project which could be positive if it's beneficial for investors.
8. ""best $ goog news in awhile mt AT_USER google to end forced g + integration , drastically cut division resources URL"" – negative about forcing integration and cutting resources, which might impact the company negatively.
9. ""avoid mistakes like $ re $ cim $ cree $ goog equity URL"" – no clear sentiment here; it's just a warning without explicit positive or negative language.
10. "" $ fti are you investing in $ hes $ mtw $ goog check out URL"" – mentions investing, which could be positive if the user is actively considering investments but not necessarily all investors.
11. ""stocks you might want to hold onto $ clwr $ jbht $ chd $ goog i suggest URL"" – neutral; just suggesting holding stocks without explicit sentiment.
12. "" $ goog - [ video ] google , apple , intel and adobe settle employees lawsuit -> URL stock stocks stockaction"" – no specific news related to Google, but mentions a legal matter which might not directly impact the stock price positively or negatively unless it's expected to affect financials.
13. ""top stocks today . find out why . $ nus $ rht $ mrvl $ goog nse URL"" – general advice without sentiment on Google's performance.
14. ""rt AT_USER . AT_USER apple , AT_USER & adobe pay $ 324 million to settle workers ' lawsuit URL $ goog $ aapl $ intc $ adbe"" – mentions payments related to a lawsuit but no direct positive or negative indication of stock performance.
15. ""this weeks stocks you should watch $ tif $ btya $ rvbd $ goog wallstreet URL"" – neutral, as it's just a recommendation without sentiment.
16. ""google glass not available ! ! read last paragraph URL $ aapl , $ goog , $ intc , $ adbe , $ googl , $ himx"" – no specific Google news here; mentions other tech companies but not related to Google.
17. ""ihs are you thinking of selling $ pnc $ nwsa $ goog moneymanagement URL"" – negative sentiment towards selling stock.
18. ""stocks you might want to hold onto $ enh $ beav $ lpnt $ goog wallstreet URL"" – neutral; just suggesting holding stocks without explicit sentiment.
19. ""goog heavyweights apple and google battle for mobile gaming supremacy URL"" – mentions a competition between two major tech companies but doesn't provide positive or negative info on Google's performance.
20. ""best pennystock research $ deck $ nue $ hme $ goog money URL"" – similar to tweet 1, neutral without sentiment.
21. ""goog : apple , google , intel , adobe settle antitrust hiring case URL"" – mentions a legal issue but no direct impact on Google's stock.
22. ""are you thinking of investing in $ vvc $ goog $ hts $ ir visit URL"" – negative, as it mentions selling stock.

Now, I'll go through each tweet and assign sentiment based on the information available. For tweets with clear positive or negative info about Google, like the one mentioning a new video-game stadium project or a lawsuit related to integration, those should be considered more likely to have positive sentiments. The others might be neutral or just general advice.

Looking at all these tweets, the ones that mention selling stock (tweets 4,5,6,10,21) are definitely negative. However, the one mentioning a new project (tweet 7) could influence investors positively if it's expected to generate value. The others don't have strong positive or negative language. Tweets about lawsuits (8 and 16) might be negative but not definitive. The tweet suggesting investments (10) is more about general behavior than sentiment.

Given that the majority of tweets are neutral or mention selling stock, which is a clear negative action for investors, I'll lean towards a Negative overall sentiment."
2014-04-26,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on stock prices. I'm not very experienced in financial analysis, but I'll take it step by step.

First, each tweet provides a company symbol and mentions ""goog."" From that, I can identify the companies involved. Let's see:

1. ca $ dnkn $ biib $ goog
2. mdu $ rcl $ fisv $ goog
3. txn $ cern $ cnp $ goog
4. hfc $ pf $ aig $ goog
5. pps $ todays $ movers $ goog
6. coh $ aes $ nrg $ goog
7. atm $ ebay , PayPal might be in trouble. goog rolls out email money feature. no fee if you link to bank account rather …
8. wday buying or selling ? wbc $ wm $ goog liquidity
9. ocr $ hp $ etfc $ goog singedinvestor
10. because they gave the cheddar $ goog “ AT_USER why google is sending its smartphones into space : URL URL
11. latest info on stocks like $ wpo $ unh $ pcp $ goog wallstreet
12. find out the latest on $ adm $ abbv $ srcl $ goog click
13. stocks you might want to buy $ gas $ rop $ lng $ goog liquidity
14. $ dhi are you thinking of selling $ gps $ unt $ goog nse
15. rt AT_USER apple's iphone 5c ate up android while google's moto x flopped : why everyone was wrong $ aapl $ goog

Hmm, some of these seem like they might be about the stock market or tech companies. Let me think about each tweet and what it might mean.

Tweet 1: ""are you considering buying ca $ dnkn $ biib $ goog try this URL"" – It's a vague call to action with an unrelated link. Maybe not relevant enough for stock price analysis.

Tweet 2: ""should you buy mdu $ rcl $ fisv $ goog view now url"" – Another call to action, perhaps for tech stocks, but not clearly related.

Tweet 3: ""are you hanging on to txn $ cern $ cnp $ goog singedinvestor url"" – This is interesting because it mentions PayPal being in trouble and rolling out an email money feature. That could be positive or negative news about their financials.

Twitter 4: ""are you considering buying hfc $ pf $ aig $ goog goto url"" – Another call to action, maybe for another tech company.

Tweet 5: ""$ pps todays movers to research $ cwh $ kmpr $ goog i suggest url"" – This seems like a link to researching the stocks. Maybe they're suggesting something positive or negative about their performance.

 Tweet 6: ""looking for the next coh $ aes $ nrg $ goog visit url"" – Another call to action, possibly related to stock analysis.

Tweet 7: ""rt AT_USER apple's iphone 5c ate up android while google's moto x flopped : why everyone was wrong $ aapl $ goog url"" – This seems like a detailed comment from Twitter about the tech companies' developments. It could indicate a negative sentiment if people are worried or skeptical.

Tweet 8: ""wday buying or selling ? wbc $ wm $ goog liquidity url"" – Again, a call to action for stock trading. Not sure about its impact yet.

Tweet 9: ""are you bullish on these stocks ocr $ hp $ etfc $ goog singedinvestor url"" – A strong positive statement about bullishness on tech stocks.

Tweet 10: ""$ dhi are you thinking of selling gps $ unt $ goog nse url"" – Another call to action, maybe for a company.

Tweet 11: ""rt AT_USER apple's iPhone 5c ate up android while google's moto x flopped : why everyone was wrong $ aapl $ goog url"" – Same as tweet7, more detailed info on tech developments.

Tweet 12: ""find out the latest on adm $ abbv $ srcl $ goog click url"" – Another call to action for stock research.

Tweet 13: ""stocks you might want to buy gas $ rop $ lng $ goog liquidity url"" – Positive statement about buying stocks, which could mean bullishness.

Tweet 14: ""$ dhi are you thinking of selling gps $ unt $ goog nse url"" – Another call to action. Maybe for a different company.

Tweet 15: ""rt AT_USER apple's iPhone 5c ate up android while google's moto x flopped : why everyone was wrong $ aapl $ goog url"" – Same as tweets7 and 11, more details on tech issues.

Now, putting it all together. Tweets7,9,10,11 are talking about potential changes in companies' developments related to technology or mobile devices. These could affect the stock prices significantly, especially if there's a shift in consumer behavior towards Apple's iPhone and Google's Android. Negative sentiment might come from people questioning the market trends.

Tweets5,6,13,14 mention that they're looking for the next big thing in tech. This shows interest but doesn't specify whether it's positive or negative. It could be either way depending on what comes up.

Tweet8 is a call to action, possibly related to stock trading decisions. It might not directly affect the company's stock price but could influence investor behavior.

The most impactful tweets seem to be 7,9,10,11 where they talk about potential developments in tech companies. These are more detailed and likely provide clearer insights into their future performance. Therefore, the overall sentiment is probably negative because of the uncertainty around these tech developments."
2014-04-27,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for the given company. So, first I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the list, all the tweets seem to involve different stocks like AMZN, GOG, NKE, AAPL, etc.

Next, I have to break down each tweet into Positive and Negative factors. Hmm, but in this case, it's a bit tricky because each tweet is pretty short and seems to be discussing stock research or trends rather than specific company performance. That might make it harder to assess the sentiment for each tweet individually since there are no explicit metrics or quotes.

For example, the first tweet says, ""are you thinking of investing in $ smg $ tpx $ kmi $ goog stock URL."" Without any specifics, it's hard to tell if this is positive or negative. It seems like a general investment call without clear data points. The same goes for the others—each one mentions trends, research, but not specific company metrics.

Then there's the section about assessing sentiment. I think each tweet's impact on investor sentiment might vary. Some could be encouraging, others might be overcautious. But given that each tweet is speculative and based on broad market reports or stock market trends, it's likely that each is somewhat neutral because they're not providing concrete information but rather updates on broader markets.

Lastly, the overall sentiment summary. Since all tweets are about future trends and research, it doesn't indicate a clear positive or negative outlook. It might be that these tweets are just informational posts without any actionable insights. So, combining all this, I think the overall impact is neutral because each tweet contributes to general market research rather than making a specific investment decision."
2014-04-28,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for the given company. The user has provided a list of 18 tweets related to stocks. My goal is to break down each tweet to assess its positive or negative influence.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. But looking through the tweets, it seems some are about different companies. For example, the first tweet mentions ""tif"" and ""emc,"" which aren't familiar to me. Maybe they're typos or acronyms? Or perhaps they refer to specific stocks?

Next, I'll go tweet by tweet. The third tweet talks about a moving average expert not knowing the 200 DMA represents and selling on breaks, which sounds like sell-making content. This could create market interest if others follow.

The fourth tweet mentions buying stocks listed under $ lo, $ pps, etc., suggesting potential buys. But it's speculative without context.

The fifth tweet talks about next hot pennystock for liquidity, maybe pushing another stock as a trend move.

Sixth discusses a data stock and its worth, which could be a sell-off if expected.

The seventh tweet is about the APlex stock being overpriced relative to 52 DMAs. That's a classic buy signal because overpricing can drive demand.

Eighth tweet suggests listening to experts before making investment choices, which might encourage cautious approaches but not necessarily positive sentiment yet.

Ninth tweet mentions hitting buzz on an unrelated topic related to Google.

Tenth tweet is about setting up an algorithm for today, perhaps trying to capitalize on trends. It's a bit vague without specifics.

Eleventh talks about research on Google stock, possibly for a product launch or update.

Twelfth asks if holding Vercal stock would be beneficial, indicating an interest in it but not clear buy intent yet.

Thirteenth and fourteenth questions about holding stocks like Phish or Facebook, which are specific to tech companies. This could indicate investor interest but without info on stock performance.

Fifteenth tweet suggests small-cap stocks breaking a high point, maybe pushing another stock up.

Sixteenth tweet seems to suggest studying charts before investing, encouraging a research-based approach.

Seventeenth mentions watching a list of stocks as if tracking, which might be speculative.

Eighteenth and nineteenth tweets are about Amg and AON being overvalued. They could push towards buying or increasing investments in these companies.

Now, considering each tweet's content:

- Many tweets suggest buying specific stocks (4th, 17th) or pushing others up (15th, 19th).
- Some imply selling on break days (3rd), which might drive the stock higher.
- Others are about research efforts, suggesting a cautious buy but not definitive.

The sentiment overall seems positive because many tweets either push stocks up or suggest investments. However, without knowing if these actions have materialized into actual buying or increasing valuations, it's hard to say definitively. It’s more speculative than confirmatory."
2014-04-29,Negative,"Okay, I need to determine the overall impact on the stock price of the given company based on the provided tweets. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. **Identify the Target Stock**: The first thing is to extract the stock symbol from any of the tweets. Looking at tweet 3, there's a URL with ""goog"", so that must be Google Inc. (GOOGL).

2. **Tweet-by-Tweet Analysis**:
   - **Tweet 1**: It mentions self-driving cars but doesn't directly talk about stocks or stock symbols. It looks like it might not impact the stock price much.
   - **Tweet 2**: The tweet is in Chinese, and while it talks about selling or holding stocks, the language is unclear and not relevant to Google's performance.
   - **Tweet 3**: Talks about Q&A with Powell regarding cable business amid turbulent changes. Not related to Google's financials.
   - **Tweet 4**: Suggests buying or selling stocks based on some picks from ACM and GW, which are unrelated to Google.
   - **Tweet 5**: Discusses pennystock research on RHI, GPC, and the economy of Google. This is not related to Google's performance as a company.
   - **Tweet 6**: Involves investing in Rig, EEA, and Google trying a new tactic. Not directly affecting Google's stock price.
   - **Tweet 7**: Asking about buying or selling stocks based on penny stock picks. Again, unrelated to Google.
   - **Tweet 8**: Platinum members in the penny stock picks gained 4000% over the year. This seems like it could be positive news for investors.
   - **Tweet 9**: Talks about investment webinar related to TSLA (TESSLA Inc.), not Google.
   - **Tweet 10**: Comments on investors missing Google's earnings. This is a negative point because missed earnings can hurt the stock price.
   - **Tweet 11**: Suggests watching stocks like OGE, AMAT, and GOOG for financial news. Not related to Google performance.
   - **Tweet 12**: Looks for an breakout time on ATK and HCN with a value check for Google. Unrelated to stock performance.
   - **Tweet 13**: Involves a webinar on swinging trades for TSLA, not Google.
   - **Tweet 14**: Talks about selling $49,151 worth of Google between specific prices. This is direct financial advice, which can negatively impact the stock price if the user sells stocks.
   - **Tweet 15**: Discusses top stocks and seeking financial news on GNM. Unrelated to Google.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - ** tweet 8**: Platinum members gained 4000%—this is positive news that could boost investor sentiment.
   - **tweet 10**: Investors missing earnings—it's a critical point, which can be negative as it affects market expectations and stock price.
   - **tweet 14**: Selling Google stocks directly impacts the stock price negatively.

4. **Overall Sentiment Summary**:
   - Positive tweets: Only tweet 8 shows positive news about investors' gains from platinum members.
   - Negative tweets: Tensions in earnings, selling of stocks directly impact sentiment.
   - Neutral: No other tweets show neutral or no effect on Google's performance.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the mixed signals—positive for some but negative for others—it's a mix of positive and negative impacts, making the stock likely to be [Negative]."
2014-04-30,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this analysis task. So, the user has given me 13 tweets and wants me to determine their impact on a company's stock price. They've specified that each tweet is about a particular company or stock symbol, denoted by $ followed by the word "" goog."" My job is to go through each tweet, analyze it based on the provided steps, and then conclude whether the overall effect is positive, neutral, or negative.

First, I need to identify the target stock for each tweet. That seems straightforward since every tweet starts with a symbol like $ goog. So, let me note down each stock as they appear:

1. AT_USER
2.goog
3.rpai
4.cbst
5.soag
6.ddr
7.hlf
8.volvo
9.abbv
10.goo
11.tsla
12.orcl
13.awi

Wait, some of these might be abbreviations or not standard symbols. For example, AT_USER could refer to a company named AT_USER, which I don't recognize. The same goes for others like rlb ddr and soag. Since the user didn't specify which stock each symbol refers to, I need to make an assumption here. Maybe these are abbreviations for something else? Or perhaps they're referring to companies with similar names but different symbols. Without more context, it's hard to pin down, so maybe I should leave them as is or note that the information isn't provided.

Moving on, each tweet provides a piece of advice or comment from AT_USER about their company in relation to another company (like Google) and their political stance or stock positions. My task is to parse these tweets for positive or negative factors related to each company's stock.

Starting with tweet 1: ""AT_USER and how is this much different from what $ goog et al do in the us and rest of the world in co-operation with these govts ? nsa"" — I'm not sure about the content here. It seems like a political comment, which could be seen as either positive or neutral depending on the context.

Tweet 2: ""$ goog motorola admonished for refusing apple licenses URL"" — This looks like a statement from Google mentioning that they're not taking Apple's license away. Apple is a major competitor to Google, so this seems negative because it might imply competition issues, which could hurt their stock.

Tweet 3: "" todays movers to research $ rpai $ ca $ ev $ goog worth a look URL"" — This suggests that researchers are looking into $ rpai, $ ca, $ ev, and $ goog. Google is involved here, so if they're researching something related to Google, it could be positive or neutral depending on the specifics of what they're studying.

Tweet 4: ""top stocks today . find out why . $ msm $ cbst $ so $ goog wallstreet URL"" — This seems like a call to action from Google about finding reasons for investing. A focus on Wall Street might indicate investment interest, which could be positive if it's related to the company's strategy or stock movements.

Tweet 5: ""are you thinking of investing in $ ddr $ hlf $ tsn $ goog try this URL"" — Similar structure as tweet 4, a call to action but not specifying what's being invested in. This might indicate some interest in Google but without more context, it's hard to assess the impact.

Tweet 6: ""rt AT_USER a quick $ study tip from april 30 about trading fed days $ spx $ aapl $ goog URL mkt"" — Again, a political comment suggesting a quick tip on trading, possibly related to the financial markets. This could be seen as neutral or negative depending on whether it affects investor sentiment.

Tweet 7: ""do you think you should hold $ goog $ gdi $ val $ spy newsletter URL"" — Google's stock is involved here in a newsletter. A call to hold would imply some level of interest, which could be positive if they align with the company's strategy or if there are strategic reasons for holding.

Tweet 8: ""volvo autonomous car project underway ! URL volvo plans release car in 2017 , close to $ goog & $ tsla ."" — Volvox is making an autonomous car project, which could be a positive factor if Google and Tesla's stock performance would reflect technological advancements. This could boost the company's stock positively.

Tweet 9: ""today's stocks you should be watching $ abbv $ sdrl $ k $ goog financialnews URL"" — A call to watch for stocks, implying some level of interest in them, possibly positive if Google is a major player there.

Tweet 10: ""$ goog - google denies shady claim that adsense robbed publishers -> URL stock stocks stockaction"" — Google denying a regulatory issue could have negative implications if the claim was malicious and damaging their reputation or business practices. This might hurt the stock price negatively.

Tweet 11: ""tech media stocks in the news : google , inc . ( nasdaq : googl ) , twitter inc ... $ goog URL"" — Google is mentioned as a tech media company, which could be positive if this leads to increased coverage and attention for them. Alternatively, it might imply that their stock performance reflects media engagement.

Tweet 12: ""great pennystock research $ orcl $ spls $ amzn $ goog money URL"" — A call to research a pennystock (which I don't recognize) about Google's performance could be seen as neutral if the specifics aren't clear, but it might indicate some interest in Google.

Tweet 13: ""dont want to lose like you did with $ awi $ gm $ rvbd $ goog check out URL"" — Similar to tweet 4 and 6, a statement about losing money, implying investment interest. Positive if the focus aligns with Google's goals or strategy.

Now, compiling this information:

- AT_USER has tweets that are mostly political comments (tweets 1, 3, 5, etc.), which can be seen as both positive (if related to social media trends) and neutral.
- Google (GOOGL) appears in several positive tweets, especially those indicating their focus on tech innovation, such as tweet 8. It's also mentioned in negative tweets about competitors or regulatory issues.
- Tech media ties with Google are suggested by some tweets, implying increased attention if relevant.

Considering all these factors, the overall sentiment seems mixed but leaning towards neutral. The positive and negative comments from AT_USER can balance out, especially since they're mostly political and not specific to the stock performance. Google's focus on innovation and strategic projects (like Volvox) adds a positive signal, while regulatory issues and competitor pressures could weigh it slightly negatively.

Therefore, I would conclude that the overall sentiment is [Neutral]."
2014-05-01,Negative,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of the given company. The user has provided 23 tweets, each with specific factors and mentions. My task is to evaluate each tweet's sentiment and overall impact.

First, I need to identify the target stock mentioned in each tweet. For example, in tweet number 1, it refers to $ mdu $. Then, for each tweet, I have to assess if there are positive or negative factors related to the company. 

Looking at tweet 2, it mentions gains for FB and others, which could be positive. Similarly, tweets 5-23 provide more specific information about the company.

I'll go through each tweet one by one:

1. Tweet 1 talks about taking gains but doesn't mention positive or negative factors about the stock.
2. Tweets 4,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,17: Mention of things like companies being a mover or researcher with specific products. These could be positive as they indicate the company's activity in the market.
3. Tweets 7,14,15,18,19,20,21,23: Specific mentions about companies like GM, IBM, Google (GMO), etc., which are known for their performance. These seem positive because they directly mention successful companies with good financials or trends.
4. Tweets 3,16,22,24: These discuss upcoming earnings or news related to the company's products. Positive if it's expected growth, negative if the outlook is bad.

Now, compiling this information, I can see that tweets 2,4,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,17,21, etc., mention specific companies and their performance or products. These are more direct and positive indicators because they tie directly to the stock's performance. Tweets 5-23 that talk about GMO or GM are also strong positives.

On the flip side, tweets like 14 mention looking for investments in AMD and a company called RHI, which might not be as directly related if the user isn't familiar with those products.

However, all the positive factors point towards a favorable outlook for the stock. The market is generally optimistic about GM's growth potential, especially since several tweets are directly linked to GMO's performance. 

Therefore, despite some less direct mentions of specific companies, the overall sentiment seems positive because multiple tweets highlight the company's strengths and expected growth."
2014-05-02,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of AT_USER. I'm not very familiar with stock analysis techniques, but I'll go through each tweet step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the tweets provided:

1. ""AT_USER says $ 1500 goog glass's parts cost only ~ $ 80 . no mention of years of r & d cost . clickbait URL""
2. ""should you buy , sell or hold $ plcm $ xyl $ pps $ goog stockmarket URL""
3. ""read what the marketocracy research community says about AT_USER future . can it double ? $ bbry $ appl $ fb $ goog URL""
4. ""$ goog google signs second lease with merced county URL""
5. ""$ vntv earnings news on $ iff $ aeo $ goog visit URL""
6. ""stocks i'm keeping my eye on ... should you ? $ bio $ wat $ gntx $ goog try this URL""
7. ""rt AT_USER google faces antitrust lawsuit on u . s . mobile internet search URL $ goog""
8. ""$ goog : [ video ] fast money final trade : goog , bkw , ewg , nue URL""
9. ""$ goog - google wont scan apps for education emails -> URL stock stocks stockaction""
10. ""$ goog : [ video ] lnkd growth trajectory good : analyst URL""
11. ""rt AT_USER $ goog search isn't threatened by social search $ fb $ twtr $ lnkd URL""
12. ""$ cop find more winners like $ lnt $ tdg $ goog liquidity URL""
13. ""dont want to lose like you did with $ apam $ exc $ he $ goog stockmarket URL""
14. ""are you hanging on to $ clx $ rcl $ goog $ grpn newsletter rate_limit_exceeded""
15. ""$ goog : [ video ] bandwidth hogs $ spx , $ pcln , $ rut , $ spy , $ goog . l URL""
16. ""$ goog : [ video ] why youtube is pushing google preferred ad pitch URL""
17. ""$ bxp today's stocks you should watch $ mmm $ morn $ goog worth a look URL""

Looking at tweet 1, it mentions the cost of parts and says there's no mention of years of R&D. It's a clickbait-like statement with some negative language.

Tweet 2 is more general about stock market reactions without specific direction or context.

Tweet 3 is discussing potential future growth but doesn't provide enough info to assess sentiment.

Tweets 4-7 are specific mentions like company announcements, which could influence investor sentiment. Some mention partnerships (tweets 4 and 10), others talk about earnings reports (tweets 5,9). There's a link for the blog on fast money trading with some specific companies mentioned.

Tweets 8 is another announcement about a video linked to the stock. This type of positive news can be quite impactful.

Tweet 17 suggests watching upcoming stocks based on technical indicators, which could add buy pressure.

But looking at all the tweets, most are speculative or not providing enough context to gauge sentiment. Tweets like 3 and 4 are more about potential growth, while others are about announcements. The overall sentiment seems mixed because there's a mix of positive (like specific announcements) and some speculative content without clear direction. It might be a neutral stance since without concrete information, it's hard to determine the net impact."
2014-05-03,Positive,"Okay, I need to figure out how these tweets impact the stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet is about finding information on $JLL$ HBI $AL$ $GOOG$ on the NSE URL. That seems like a straightforward request for information, not directly related to buying or selling stocks.

2. The second tweet mentions getting more info on $AGCO$ $GLL$ $GOG$ and suggests trying it. Again, this is about research, not stock actions.

3. The third tweet is regretting an investment in $WAFD$ $DKS$ $BRCD$ $GOOG$, suggesting they won't buy the stock anymore. This is a negative sentiment towards their position.

4. The fourth tweet talks about small-cap stocks making 52-week highs, mentioning $SYMC$ $JWH$ $HSP$ and talking about URLs. This doesn't directly state a purchase or sale decision but gives context on stock performance, which might influence investor views.

5. The fifth tweet is a research suggestion for $COV$, focusing on tech and mention of PANEW. Again, just information seeking without buying or selling.

6. The sixth tweet mentions CTRX monitoring $RBC$ $RL$ $GOG$. Not a stock action but related to stock performance indicators.

7. The seventh tweet suggests that Apple's Iwatch will be successful, pointing out reasons. This could imply positive sentiment about future trends and investment ideas.

8. The eighth tweet talks about today's stocks to watch, which is more about monitoring market activity than buying.

9-12: The next six tweets mention avoiding a loss or investing in $DGX$, $RYN$ etc., which are all information-based, not stock actions.

So, the main positive factors seem to be the seventh tweet mentioning Apple's success and potential investment ideas. The other tweets are about research or monitoring but don't indicate buying. So overall sentiment is positive because there's a clear direction for investment."
2014-05-04,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of the company.

First, I need to extract the stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""$ rmd $ int $ isrg $ goog check out URL"". Hmm, that's not immediately clear. Maybe it's ""GOOG""? Let me assume that as the target stock since many of the other tweets mention Google-related terms like GOOG, CME, OKE, etc.

Now, I'll go through each tweet one by one to assess their impact on GOOG.

1. The first tweet is: ""buy or sell ? $ rmd $ int $ isrg $ goog check out URL"". Not sure what this means, but it seems like a query about buying or selling something related to GOOG. Since there's no clear positive or negative indication here, maybe it's neutral.

2. Second tweet: ""could be breaktout time on $ frx $ key $ gra $ goog money URL"". This looks like a potential event where GOOG might reach a sell-off peak. That could indicate a negative sentiment as investors are selling their stocks during a trend downwards.

3. Third tweet is identical to the second one: ""could be breaktout time on $ frx $ key $ gra $ goog money URL"". Same reasoning applies here; it's suggesting a potential dip in GOOG, which would be negative.

4. Fourth tweet: ""$ cme considering investing in $ mb $ cnqr $ goog must have URL"". This mentions the CME options and investment considerations but doesn't provide specific info on GOOG or a clear positive or negative outcome. Maybe neutral since it's about actions related to GOOG, not just sentiment.

5. Fifth tweet: ""are you hanging on to $ ea $ wafd $ dell $ goog click URL"". This seems like an offer from DELL to buy GOOG if someone is holding onto the stock. Positive because they're providing a deal, which could boost the price and increase the stock's value.

6. Sixth tweet: ""todays movers to research $ oke $ hcp $ dov $ goog personalfinance URL"". This mentions moving towards fundamentals or personal finance, but it doesn't directly relate to GOOG. Maybe neutral because it's speculative about future trends.

7. Seventh tweet: ""are you bearish on these stocks $ vsh $ hca $ mygn $ goog nasdaq URL"". Here, the user is expressing a negative outlook, suggesting they're bearish on GOOG. Negative sentiment as a positive outlook would be bad for the stock price.

8. Eighth tweet: ""$ goog - web gaming future : 3 - d graphics games in the browser without plug-ins -> URL stock stocks stockaction"". This seems like predicting that GOOG will go through some technical features, but it doesn't mention buying or selling actions. Maybe neutral as it's about future trends without direct investment advice.

Now, let me summarize the impact from each tweet:

1. Neutral
2. Negative (possible sell-off)
3. Negative (same as 2)
4. Neutral
5. Positive (offer to buy)
6. Neutral ( Speculative but no investment action)
7. Negative ( bearish outlook)
8. Neutral

Considering these, the positive tweet about DELL offering a deal seems significant and likely to have an impact on GOOG, possibly increasing it. The negative tweets from GOOG's perspective would reduce sentiment, while neutral tweets don't affect much.

So overall, the impact is mixed but leaning towards positive due to the offer by DELL, outweighing the negative outlooks."
2014-05-05,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to determine whether each tweet is positive, negative, or neutral in terms of impact on a given company's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the target stock mentioned in the tweets: It seems like it might be General Motors (GM), since they're appearing frequently and discussing earnings. GM is known for its strong financial performance but can have volatile stock prices because of economic factors.

Now, I'll go through each tweet one by one:

1. The first tweet mentions that LinkedIn's earnings beat expectations but has a tepid outlook. Since GM isn't mentioned here, this might not affect their stock price much. So, probably neutral.

2. The second tweet talks about small-cap stocks breaking into the 50s. While that could be good news for some investors, it might also mean higher volatility and risks. However, since it's just discussing a market event without specific positive or negative info on GM, I'm not sure if it impacts their stock price significantly. So, maybe neutral.

3. This tweet mentions the morning dump due to May 5th and includes several stocks: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), Facebook (FB), and other companies like Skype and LinkedIn. It seems like a general warning about a market rally. GM isn't mentioned, so probably neutral.

4. The tweet talks about small-cap stocks breaking into the 50s with high prices for several companies. Again, without specific details on GM or this stock, it's hard to gauge the impact. Neutral.

5. This one mentions a breakout time on some financial terms: ORI, IACI, CTSH. Not sure what these abbreviations mean, but again, doesn't mention any stocks related to GM. So, neutral.

6. Discusses AlphaPoint (AT&T) and how it compares with other tech companies. No mention of GM here either. Neutral.

7. Looks for research on MSI and DFS: MSCI is a market index, DFS could refer to firms dealing or firms seeking to deal in something. Not relevant to GM. Neutral.

8. Also looking for more info on Pankhurst (Panw) and Bxp: Again, no mention of GM. Neutral.

Putting it all together, none of the tweets are directly related to General Motors. They're discussing a broader market or other stocks that might not affect GM's stock price significantly. So, overall sentiment is neutral."
2014-05-06,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions Twitter growing and multiple tech companies like Google. It seems like it's positive about growth in the market but not much else. So, that might be a mix of positive and neutral factors.

2. Next tweet talks about pennystock research for Goog and other stocks. This is about potential investments or analysis, which could be positive if someone thinks buying makes sense.

3. Similar to the second one, another focus on Goog, so again, some positive info about the company but no specifics beyond that.

4. The tweet advises against selling stocks because they don't match their names. This seems like a negative tip, advising caution, which could lead investors to avoid certain stocks.

5. A swing trading webinar is suggested. Swing traders usually have specific goals and may not be buying or selling based on company name, so this sounds positive in terms of strategies but perhaps negative if it's just a general information tweet.

6. Google wanting to launch Siri with other major tech companies. This could imply expansion into services but not directly about the stock itself.

7. A user comment comparing Alibaba and other tech companies. While interesting, it doesn't specify any action or advice related to Goog, so probably neutral.

8. A tweet asking to buy, sell, or hold stocks based on a specific research. This is a tip towards decision-making but not about the stock itself.

9. Google stating that their valuation is 165 billion, higher than S&P 500's 95th percentile, which suggests they are undervalued. This is positive for investors who expect high growth.

10. Another S&P webinar on swing trading. Again, more about strategies and not directly about stock decisions.

11. Repeated tweet from the same person as the previous one, just repeating Goog's announcement again.

12. A tweet suggesting interested in $open but with $1b mkt cap and $117m cash, which is more of a general informational tip rather than advice on stocks.

13. Positive announcement about looking bullish on IPG, Google, and MSFT. This seems positive for goog's performance.

14. A video promoting Googles venture capital arm. This could be seen as a strategic move but not directly impacting the stock price.

15. Google is expected to break on $o pre Goog stock prices. Breaking could indicate strong earnings or expectations, which might be positive.

16. Google adding Uber integration to maps. More about technology updates and services rather than stocks.

17. A tweet with a list of stocks to watch, mentioning Alphabet (Alphabet), which is Goog's sibling. This is more promotional than factual.

18. A long list of companies for investors but doesn't mention any specific stock action.

19. A tweet questioning if losing money on certain stocks. This suggests uncertainty about their performance or potential losses.

20. Another question regarding the stock market performance, indicating general awareness but not actionable information.

21. A tweet asking about winners and losers based on Goog's comparison with other tech companies. Again, more of a tip than specific advice on stocks.

22-24: Repeated positive announcements from Google about their valuation and services. This is reinforcing Goog's performance expectations.

25: Positive research on stocks for equity trading. This could indicate confidence in future growth but not necessarily a selling.

Now, let's sum up the factors:
- Positive tweets are mostly around Google, S&P 500, and other tech companies.
- Some negative tweets include suggestions to avoid investing or advises about stock comparisons without specific actions.
- A couple of positive tweets mention breaking on Goog's price, which is a positive sign.

Overall sentiment seems mixed. There are several positive factors reinforcing the expectation of good growth, but some negative advice like selling stocks based on names might pull it down. The overall sentiment leans slightly Positive because many signals point towards positive outcomes for Google and its competitors."
2014-05-07,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the company based on the given instructions. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. It seems like the common stock symbols are FB, TSLA, GOOG, TMUS, and VZ. The other tweets mention things like research or events related to these stocks but don't specify which one. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

1. ""Find out the latest on $SBNY $EXR $HBA $GOOGL CLK"" mentions GOOG (Google), so I'll focus on GOOG.
2. ""Awesome stock research on $TCL $FLU $ARW $GOOGL WTH"" also points to GOOG.
3. ""$JPM ROLL FII GOOGL Stock URL"" is about JPM, which I don't know much about yet.
4. ""Get Pennystock Research on $AAP $MLM $FDX $GOOG MUST SEE"" again mentions GOOG.
5. ""Do you need stock research on $BTCU $CRS $CAR $GOOGLE Newsletter"" focuses on GOOG as well.
6. ""RT AT_USER how alibaba compares with other major tech companies : URL Aapl Goog Mstf"" seems like comparing Google to other tech companies, so GOOG is involved here too.
7. ""$GOOGLprivacy increasingly not a big deal , says start-up URL."" This is about Google's privacy policies, which could affect the stock.
8. ""Are you looking for more winners like $Hot $LSTR $P $GOOGLE Newsletter"" mentions GOOG again.
9. ""Should you hold or add to $QCOM OIS CCO GOOGLE Must have URL"" focuses on GOOG as well.
10. This tweet talks about a stock breakout pattern, which is an event that could impact the stock price.
11. ""Inside trading alerts on $Sig OAS APC GOOGLE Research URL."" Also mentions GOOG and potential insider trading concerns.
12. Same as tweet 6: comparing alibaba with tech companies, so GOOG is involved.
13. ""$GOOGLE NASDAQ DELIVERY Hitting the Brakes"" refers to Google's stock performance on NASDAQ.
14. ""Should you buy TMUS SD APOL GOODE ECONOMY?"" mentions GOOG again.
15. ""- [Video] Data shows homegamer equity exposure in April."" Focuses on GOOG as well, but about equity in a different sector.
16. ""$VZ VZClick URL"" which I think is VZ (Vertex), so maybe not related to Google anymore.
17. ""Get free research on $ORI JLL FLS GOOGLE Singinginvestor."" Again, mentions GOOG.

So, many tweets are about Google's performance or research, while a few mention other companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Tesla. Since the majority of these tweets focus on GOOG, I should probably prioritize that. 

Looking at each tweet, most are either positive (like good stock research) or neutral. Negative points would come from mentions of privacy issues (tweet 7) or insider trading concerns (tweets 11-12). Positive could be about winners like FB or GM.

However, given the focus on GOOG and its performance metrics mentioned in multiple tweets, it's likely that the stock is performing well. But since some tweets are negative about Google's privacy issues or potential insider trades, those might slightly affect the sentiment. 

I should consider if these negative points outweigh the positive ones. If most tweets are neutral except for a few negatives, it leans towards overall neutral. But considering the explicit mentions of privacy (7) and potential insider trading risks (11-12), which could create uncertainty, maybe the overall sentiment is more nuanced.

But I need to decide between [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. The key here is that while most tweets are positive in nature regarding GOOG's research and performance, there are clear negative points. Since these can't all be ignored and have significant impact on investors' emotions, it leans towards a mixed sentiment. However, the majority of the tweets suggest that the stock could potentially rise. 

But wait, sometimes negative comments can undermine confidence even if positive factors exist. However, given that several tweets are neutral or positive, I think overall, considering all these points, the stock is expected to perform positively, so maybe [Positive]."
2014-05-08,Neutral,"Alright, so I need to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price for Intellixence Inc., symbol INTC. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First tweet: ""intel is still a buy , monopoly on chromebooks is just a bonus URL $ intc , $ goog"". It seems like it's encouraging investors, suggesting they should stay interested in INTC despite the Google product being a bonus. That sounds positive.

Second tweet: ""stocks to watch this week $ brcd $ lltc $ frx $ goog must have URL"". This is just listing stocks with their symbols but doesn't provide any information about INTC. So, not much to gain here; it's probably neutral or even negative if the user is suggesting focus on those stocks.

Third tweet: "" $ mkl here are some stocks to watch $ im $ alle $ goog money URL"". Similar to the second one, it lists several stocks but again, no info about INTC. Still not giving any specific direction.

Fourth tweet: "" $ goog google extends intel love affair with new bay trail chromebooks URL"". This is talking about Google extending their partnership with Intel's Chromebooks. That sounds like a positive development for Google and possibly Intellixence as well, which could boost INTC's stock price.

Fifth tweet: ""microsoft corporation ( msft ) , google inc ( goog ) a surprising push in western ... $ goog URL"". This is bringing in Microsoft and Google into a competition. While it mentions Google, the overall impact on INTC isn't clear; it could be positive if they collaborate or negative if it affects competitors.

Sixth tweet: "" $ goog - [ video ] departure of apple executive katie cotton is milestone moment -> URL stock stocks stockaction"". This tweet talks about a YouTube video and mentions Apple's executives leaving. It seems like a minor event but could potentially have some effect on their stock prices, perhaps negative if the company relies heavily on competitors.

Now, summarizing: The first tweet is positive, the others are either neutral or negative without specific info, and the last one has a minor event. Intellixence's tweets seem positive about Google, Microsoft, Apple, but without concrete information on their direct effects, it's hard to say if they'll positively affect their stock. So overall sentiment seems mixed, leaning towards [Neutral] because there are no clear signals for positive impact."
2014-05-09,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for Google. Let me start by breaking down each tweet.

1. The first tweet mentions that $GooGLe is the S&P 500's 3rd most loved stocks. That seems neutral because it's just stating information without giving any positive or negative indication.
2. The second tweet talks about Oracle winning a copyright fight, which suggests Google might benefit. I'm leaning towards a Positive sentiment here.
3. The third tweet says Oracle wins against Google in a copyright ruling, so this also supports the idea of Google possibly gaining traction, which is another Positive.
4. The fourth tweet mentions Apple upping its ""cool factor"" with someone named Swisher. Cool factors could indicate Google's success, so Positive sentiment here as well.
5. The fifth tweet asks how much $GooGLe is valued based on customer reviews. This seems like a question they might answer, but it doesn't directly provide positive or negative info on the stock itself.
6. The sixth tweet provides ways google analytics can help small businesses. Again, this is more about providing information than impacting the stock price.
7. The seventh tweet is funny, encouraging Google to buy Yelp by offering double deals. This seems like a joke and not related to the stock's performance.
8. The eighth tweet gives some bearish or bullish signals on certain stocks. I'm a bit uncertain here because the context isn't clear about whether it's bullish or bearish. Maybe just neutral?
9. The ninth tweet suggests Alibaba is more important than Facebook for their IPO, but without context, this could be either positive or negative.
10. The tenth tweet says Google blocks file sharing on Demonoid due to malware downloads. This seems like a major threat and could negatively impact the stock price because they might see increased competition.

Putting it all together: Positive tweets are 2,3,4,6,8; Negative is 5,9,10. That's five positive and three negative out of ten. So overall sentiment is Positive."
2014-05-10,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price for the company in question. Let me start by breaking down each tweet.

The first tweet says, ""rt AT_USER $ goog this google glass ' commercial isn't creepy — but it will make you cry ! URL."" It sounds like they're commenting on something related to Google Glass and how a company might feel that way. That could mean some positive sentiment towards the stock because mentioning something tech-related might attract investors looking for innovative companies.

The second tweet is "" $ goog : apple buying beats for $ 3.2 billion ? smart move URL."" Apple purchasing money seems like a good sign because it shows financial stability and growth potential. Apple's success can positively impact the company, so this might be a positive factor.

The third tweet mentions drones hitting an airliner and refers to Beemoo and Facebook. It seems concerning but in a professional context, these could be used for strategic purposes or even sensitive information. But since it's not directly mentioned as something negative about the stock, I'm not sure yet. It might add some uncertainty, which is neutral.

Now, combining all this: positive from Google Glass, smart move on Apple, and a bit of uncertainty from drones. These are varied but mostly positive factors. So overall, it looks like the sentiment is [Positive]."
2014-05-11,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets about a company's stock price impact based on their content. The user provided four tweets and asked to determine if each is positive, neutral, or negative in terms of affecting the stock.

First, looking at tweet 1: ""rt AT_USER twitter memperkenalkan simbol baru cashtags $ untuk melihat percakapan pada saham dan perusahaan.contoh : $ goog untuk google."" This seems like it's introducing a new stock symbol, which is standard practice when companies go public. That usually doesn't have a clear positive or negative impact unless there's something specific mentioned about the company.

Next, tweet 2: ""rt AT_USER twitter memperkenalkan simbol baru cashtags $ untuk melihat percakapan pada saham dan perusahaan.contoh : $ goog untuk google."" Similar to the first tweet. It's again introducing a new stock symbol without any additional details. No clear indication of what this could do for the company's performance, so probably neutral.

Tweet 3: ""rt AT_USER twitter memperkenalkan simbol baru cashtags $ untuk melihat percakapan pada saham dan perusahaan.contoh : $ goog untuk google."" Again, introducing a new symbol. No extra info, just another tweet on the same topic. The user is talking about the moon obsession, so maybe that's something specific but not directly linked to the stock. Still, it might be considered neutral because it doesn't specifically mention anything positive or negative about the company.

Now, tweet 4: ""AT_USER soon , traveling to the moon will become as seamless as a transatlantic flight : $ goog” with exclamation points. This is interesting. The user is talking about their travel plans related to the moon and how it's as seamless as a transatlantic flight. The mention of a new stock symbol, $ goog, seems unrelated at first glance, but the part about traveling to the moon is pretty specific. Maybe there's some hidden information or a joke that could affect investors, but without explicit positive or negative indicators, it's hard to tell.

Putting this together: Each tweet is just adding details on how they're going to travel to the moon, which isn't related to the stock symbol. The stock symbol tweet might be neutral because it doesn't give any information about the company's financial health. So overall, none of these tweets seem to have a clear positive or negative impact on the stock price."
2014-05-12,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and figure out how they'll impact the stock price of the company mentioned, which is Google with the symbol $ goog. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at each tweet individually. 

1. The first tweet says ""rt AT_USER how alibaba compares with other major tech companies : URL $ aapl $ goog $ msft URL"". Hmm, it's just repeating the stock symbols and mentions Alibaba for comparison. I don't think this is providing any significant information about Google itself. It seems more like an introductory tweet.

2. The second tweet is ""google ' c ' : vimeo ceo seeks growth without ads URL $ goog"". This one looks like a query to find out who the CEO of Google is, but it's in lowercase and uses some specific keywords. There’s no positive or negative sentiment here; it's just informational.

3. The third tweet says ""great stock newsletter on $ rf $ dis $ re $ goog click URL"". It mentions three tech companies: Rf, Dis, and Re for Google. Again, this is providing information about the company without any emotional cues. I'm not sure what specific news they're highlighting here.

4. The fourth tweet repeats ""rt AT_USER how alibaba compares with other major tech companies : URL $ aapl $ goog $ msft URL"". Similar to the first one, just repeating stock symbols and a comparison point. No meaningful info about Google.

5. The fifth tweet is ""like $ goog long at open . had a recent triple bottom lately on the 1yr . day chart . has held the 502 area repeatedly . markets"". This seems very positive. They're talking about Google's performance over time and its position in the market. Positive sentiment here.

6. The sixth tweet mentions ""$ goog - tech stocks : twitter , pandora gains lead broad tech rise URL"". It's comparing Google to other tech companies on Twitter and Facebook, but again, it's just a statement without any emotional language or data.

7. The seventh tweet is "" $ goog google's youtube quality reports will help isps “ upsell ” customers URL"". This one is talking about YouTube reports helping isps (probably iOS users) by upselling them. It sounds like they're giving advice to their target audience, but it doesn't state a clear positive or negative opinion.

Now, let me summarize the sentiments:

- The first tweet provides background without info.
- The second and fourth tweets are just questions about CEOs or comparisons.
- The third and sixth tweets give company info without emotion.
- The fifth tweet is very positive about Google's performance.
- The seventh tweet is offering advice but not influencing much.

Since the overall sentiment from the main tweet (fifth one) is positive, I'll go with a positive impact. So, the stock should go up."
2014-05-13,Negative,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the company. The user provided some tweets and asked for my opinion on whether they'll lead to a positive, neutral, or negative change in the stock price.

First, I need to identify the target stock. Looking at the tweets, one of them is $ goog - eu court : google must remove certain links on request - - 3rd update URL. That looks like it's targeting Google Inc., so that's my main focus here.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one and analyze their factors.

1. **Tweet 1**: ""$ goog - eu court : google must remove certain links on request - - 3rd update URL"" - The user mentions an EU court issue regarding Google removing specific links. Since this is related to Google's actions, it seems like Google is taking action against them. That could either be a positive or negative signal depending on the context. If Google is required to remove certain links for compliance or regulatory reasons, that might indicate a strategic move to avoid potential issues.

2. **Tweet 2**: ""$ subscribers saw our penny stock alerts gain over 4,000 % this year ! subscribe today : URL $ erbb $ bbda $ goog"" - This tweet is promoting Penny stocks with alerts. It mentions that the user can subscribe and follow them for updates on Google's penny stock performance. The positive aspect here seems to be encouraging investors by alerting them about a specific stock (penny stocks) which usually boosts investor sentiment positively.

3. **Tweet 3**: ""$ goog - twitter announces mute button for mobile -> URL stock stocks stockaction"" - This tweet is from Twitter announcing a mute button for their own stock, but it's not directly related to Google. The mention of the mute button in the context of another company might be a red flag or attention-grabbing info that could cause investor concern.

4. **Tweet 4**: ""rt AT_USER debunking the yahoo tracking stock myth URL via AT_USER $ yhoo $ fb $ vmw $ emc $ goog"" - The user is reacting to a myth about Yahoo's stock and providing links. Debunking myths typically helps clarify information, which could be seen as positive by investors who might have been misled.

5. **Tweet 5**: ""rt AT_USER twitter memperkenalkan simbol baru cashtags $ untuk melihat percakapan pada saham dan perusahaan.contoh : $ goog untuk google"" - This tweet is also from Twitter, introducing a new stock symbol and encouraging users to check Google's performance on that stock. The direct mention of Google could be seen as positive if it's an unrelated but related stock.

Now, let me assess each tweet in terms of factors—Positive and Negative.

- **Tweet 1**: Likely Negative because the EU court issue is a regulatory event, which can affect the company negatively by causing delays or compliance costs.
  
- **Tweet 2**: Positive as promoting penny stocks with alerts increases investor interest and boosts confidence.

- **Tweet 3**: Neutral since it's about another company, not Google. The mute button might be seen as cautious information, so it's neutral in its impact on the target stock.

- **Tweet 4**: Positive because debunking myths can improve investor knowledge and reduce potential misinformation, which is generally positive for the market.

- **Tweet 5**: Negative because introducing a new stock could increase competition or affect the company's reputation if there are issues with the symbol.

Now, let's combine these factors. The main tweet is Tweet 1, which is definitely negative about Google due to EU court actions.Tweet 2 adds positive elements, but it's not directly related. Tweet 3 is neutral, and 4 is positive, while 5 is negative again. 

Considering the most impactful factor here, Tweet 1 has a clear negative note about Google, which directly affects their stock price. Even if other tweets are positive or neutral, they don't overshadow the serious regulatory action in Tweet 1.

Therefore, the overall sentiment should be Negative."
2014-05-14,Negative,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how these tweets impact the stock price of a company. Let me start by identifying each tweet and analyzing their factors.

1. The first tweet talks about booting up some projects related to Google and Microsoft, mentioning URLs like goog $ msft $ 2354. This seems neutral because it's more informational rather than giving any sentiment on the stock.
   
2. The second tweet mentions Google's driverless cars and talks about 'clock ticking' with stocks. It doesn't express a positive or negative opinion but is more of an announcement.

3. The third tweet links Google to Facebook via 'reiterated by thestreet ratings team'. This seems like it could be positive because Google might look good on a social media platform, which can boost its stock.

4. Fourth tweet notes Google's Eu court ruling about removing unflattering links and mentions video. Not sure about sentiment here; maybe neutral or slightly negative if people are concerned about content.

5. The fifth tweet mentions the EU courts slams Google and says users can be forgotten online. This sounds like a strong, negative statement that could hurt investor confidence.

6. Sixth tweet talks about Apple introducing features for iOS 8. It's speculative but might not directly affect the stock unless it's a positive feature by Google, which I don't see yet.

7. Seventh tweet mentions tech stocks slipping ahead of Cisco's earnings. If earnings are up, stock might go up, which is positive.

8. Eighth tweet about open-internet things like Taiwan-Glu causality and compliance could be neutral if not impacting the company's performance.

9. Ninth tweet introduces Google Glass for $1500. Positive news about the tech stocks since it's a notable product.

10.第十 tweet talks about Google Glass being purchasable by U.S. users with supply running out. If supplies are limited, maybe positive as more people could buy it if prices are right.

11.Eleventh tweet mentions Twitter sending a message about Google's symbol on stocks. This is a direct mention of the stock name, which is positive.

12.Twelfth tweet says Google is letting everyone buy Glass now and warns not to, but just a warning without any opinion.

13.Tenth point was a selling point for the user, mentioning it could be useful. Not sure if that's a positive or negative.

14.Tenth tweet mentions compass dishes out £1B to investors on strong growth. If they're profitable, stock might go up—positive.

15.Tenth tweet about Netflix benefiting from cord-cutters being bad. Positive because more people stream content, which can boost the stock.

16.Rt AT_USER saying future transportation is Google's rides. This could be positive if it aligns with the company's vision, leading to better stock performance.

17.Tenth tweet says Google opens sales to public while supplies last. If they sell more quickly due to supply constraints, it might push prices up—positive.

18.Tenth tweet about Yahoo buying a messaging app. This is speculative but could be positive if the app positively impacts users' experience.

Now, compiling these, the tweets mention Google's earnings (positive), tech stocks slipping ahead (neutral), and some products or services (neutral). The conflicting points are the court ruling on Google’s actions with Apple (negative) and supply issues with tech companies (neutral). There's a mix of positive and negative factors."
2014-05-15,Negative,"Alright, so I have to figure out the impact of these tweets on the future stock price of a company. The user has given me five tweets and asked me to determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative, with the output being one line using ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"". 

First, let's break down each tweet step by step.

1. **dan loeb initiates positions in $ goog $ cf $ vz $ rop $ ctxs $ bud in q1 cc AT_USER**
   - This looks like it's promoting a specific investment idea from Dan Loeb. He seems to be pushing a particular stock or strategy. While his statements are positive, they might not directly relate to the broader market but could influence individual investors. However, since this tweet is more about initiating positions rather than predicting large market movements, it might have a neutral effect on the overall stock price unless it's expected to increase significantly.

2. **apple buying beats - method behind the madness URL $ goog $ p $ googl $ aapl**
   - This seems like another positive tweet promoting an investment or action related to Apple (APL) and Google (GOOG). It could be showing confidence in their stock performance, which might lead some investors to buy more. However, it's speculative unless the purchase is expected to result in a significant move.

3. **$ goog : 10 things in tech you need to know this morning URL**
   - Similar to the first tweet, this is promoting an information source about Google. While helpful for informed readers, without specifics on how it will affect stock prices, it's speculative and could have a neutral or positive impact depending on context.

4. **$ goog : [ video ] is googles tax policy evil ? URL**
   - This tweet suggests that the tax policies of Google are considered ""evil."" That's a strong negative statement about corporate governance, which could lead investors to view Google negatively. If this leads to increased fear or uncertainty about their financials, it might cause a sharp decline in stock price.

5. **loeb increases $ goog $ googl stake from 160k shares to 210k shares**
   - This is a concrete action by Dan Loeb regarding his ownership in Google. It's an explicit announcement of increasing stake, which could indicate positive sentiment as it might lead to increased visibility or management interest. However, if the increase is expected to be significant and aligns with long-term goals, this could positively influence the stock price.

Now, evaluating each tweet:

- **Tweet 1:** Promotes a specific strategy but not necessarily predicting market movements.
- **Tweet 2:** Promotes a purchase action; speculative but possibly positive for some.
- **Tweet 3:** Provides information without context on its impact.
- **Tweet 4:** Negative about tax policies, which is serious and could affect investor sentiment negatively.
- **Tweet 5:** Action regarding stake increase, which might lead to more attention or support in the long run.

Considering the combination of these tweets, Tweet 4 seems like a strong negative point due to its explicit mention of tax policies. If it's expected that Google will change their approach, it could lead investors to doubt their performance and decide against buying shares. However, some might see it as an opportunity if management changes are favorable.

But overall, with several negative tweets, the sentiment leans more towards Negative because one tweet already indicates a negative outlook on corporate governance."
2014-05-16,Positive,"Okay, let's break down how I analyzed these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of the company in question.

First, I identified the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking through the list, I see a lot of mentions of GOOGL and SLNx, so I focused on those.

Next, for each tweet, I separated the factors into positive and negative. For example, some tweets are clearly positive, like mentioning the bullish outlook or mentioning specific stocks. Others might be more neutral, such as insider trading information or generic updates about stock performance.

Then, I assessed the sentiment by evaluating how these factors influence investor confidence. The positive tweets tend to boost investor sentiment, while negative ones may either contradict expectations or indicate concerns that could impact performance.

After reviewing all the tweets, I noticed a mix of mixed reactions. Some were very supportive with positive outlooks and strong mentions of stocks, which added momentum. However, others were neutral or even negative, such as insider trading warnings or generic updates without clear direction.

Overall, there was a significant boost from the positive tweets that seemed to be encouraging the stock's potential upside. The mixed negative tweets didn't outweigh the strong positives enough to significantly affect the overall sentiment. Therefore, I concluded that the market had a positive outlook despite some minor negatives."
2014-05-17,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to figure out their impact on the stock price of $ goog, which is Google's stock. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the target stock is clearly Google since the tweets mention terms related to Google or its products and services. 

Looking at each tweet one by one:

1. The first tweet talks about stock research for $ anss $ onxx $ rht $ goog. That seems irrelevant because it's not related to Google.

2. The second tweet from lawyer gravy train mentions dropping lawsuits against Apple and Google. That sounds like a positive trend as it reduces risks, so that's a Positive factor.

3. The third tweet is looking for the next winners with stocks like USB, Pennystock, JPM, etc., but nothing specific to Google comes up here. So maybe Neutral because it's generalizing.

4. The fourth tweet states that Google and Apple settled their patent system agreement. That's definitely good news for Google, so Positive.

5. The fifth tweet says Kenya police are hunting bombers after explosions in Nairobi, resulting in 10 deaths. This doesn't relate to Google or its stock, so Neutral since it's about a different event.

6. The sixth tweet talks about holding or adding to Google's stock with others like PRGO, OII, and IR. These are all stocks, but without info on Google's performance, this is Neutral because it's speculative about Google's stock.

7. The seventh tweet suggests watching some stocks including OmC, Mack, T, and goog. Again, no specific information on Google, so Neutral.

8. Similar to tweet 6, RT from Apple agreeing to drop lawsuits; that reinforces the positive trend of reducing risks. Positive factor again.

9. The tweet from lawyer gravy train stating that Google and Apple settled their patent system agreement. That's a strong positive sign for Google's product ecosystem, which can boost stock price. Positive.

10. Another one from lawyers, same as tweet 8; they're dropping lawsuits against Apple and Google. So another positive factor to support Google's growth.

11. The twelfth tweet asks Google's research team to find the next hot pennystock and mentions LPS, CCI, and goog. This is general stock research, which is neutral because it doesn't directly affect Google's performance.

Now, compiling all factors:

- Positive tweets: 2,4,8,9
- Neutral tweets: 3,5,6,7,10,11
- Negative tweets: None

Positive factors from tweets 2 and 4. Both positive because reducing risks is good for investors. Similarly, tweets 8 and 9 reinforce the same sentiment through more direct statements.

Negative factors are minimal or none here, so overall sentiment isn't negative enough to outweigh positives.

Therefore, the stock should be positively impacting."
2014-05-18,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of Apple. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the first few lines:

1. $ goog : dan loeb sells blackberry, apple, yahoo; adds other tech companies URL – Here, ""goog"" is the target.
2. apple settles with motorola, will work with google on patent reform URL – Target is ""aapl"".
3. apple generated $43.7 billion in sales during first 3 months of 2014; more than google, amazon, and facebook combined. – Again, target is ""aapl"".

So I can note down the targets: goog, aapl, aapl.

Next, I need to analyze each tweet for positive or negative factors and their sentiment impact on investor sentiment.

Looking at each tweet:

1. Dan Loeb talks about selling blackberry, apple, yahoo. This seems like a negative statement about competitors, which would likely lower Apple's stock price.
2. Apple is settling withMotorola and working with Google on patent reform. Both Motorola and Google are tech companies, so this could be a positive signal for future growth, improving investor confidence.
3. Apple's sales in the first three months of 2014 were significantly higher than Google, Amazon, and Facebook combined. This shows strong performance, which is positive for investors.

Now, let me assess each tweet:

- Tweet 1: Negative (Dan Loeb selling competitors). Strong negative sentiment here.
- Tweet 2: Positive (working with tech companies on patent reform). Positive signal.
- Tweet 3: High sales number, which is positive. Apple's strong performance boosts investor confidence.

Putting it all together, the tweets provide mixed signals but some are supportive and others negative. However, Apple's recent high sales numbers in 2014 indicate a good trend. The fact that they're working with tech companies on patent reform suggests expansion into new areas, which could be positive for future growth.

But there's still some negative talk about competitors. So the overall sentiment might lean towards a slight positive because of the strong performance and the potential expansion, though there are competing factors.

I think the impact is mixed but leans slightly positive given the strong performance from Apple."
2014-05-19,Positive,"Okay, I need to figure out the impact on the stock price of the given company based on these tweets. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at tweet 1, it's ""google in talks about possible acquisition of live video-streaming service twitch $ goog URL."" So the stock is Google (GOOGL). 

Next, I need to analyze each tweet for positive and negative factors and assess their sentiment on investor sentiment.

Looking at tweet 2: ""$ goog - tech stocks : micron , nvidia lead chip-sector rally."" This seems positive because it mentions a tech sector rally. 

Tweet 3 continues with the chipsector rally as well. Positive again.

Tweet 4 is "" $ goog brief-mobile company divide announces acquisition by google inc."" This clearly states that Google acquired brief mobile, which is negative news for them.

Tweets 5-10 are all about Google discussing their acquisition, but the main points might be focusing on other companies like Twilio. These seem neutral because they're just talking about actions without much positive or negative info about Google's stock.

Tweet 6: ""rt AT_USER everyone must steal google's new camera feature $ aapl $ msft $ ssnlf $ goog URL via AT_USER."" This is a rumor claiming Google stole their camera features, which seems very negative. 

Tweets 7-14 are either about G-SHOUTI or discussing stock forecasts for various companies. Most don't mention anything related to Google's stock price.

Tweet 15 repeats tweet 3, continuing the chipsector rally.

Now, I'll summarize the factors:

Positive: Tech sector rally in tweet 2 and 3.
Neutral: Acquisitions discussed but about other companies.
Negative: rumor about stealing camera features claimed by Google in tweet 6.

Putting it all together, the overall sentiment is a mix of positive (rally) and negative (rumor). But since the main focus is on tech stocks and the chipsector being hot, the positive aspect might dominate. However, the negative report could slightly tip it negatively. 

But given that the rest are mostly neutral or speculative without strong data, maybe the overall sentiment leans towards [Neutral]. Or perhaps a slight push towards [Positive] because of the tech sector."
2014-05-20,Negative,"Okay, so I have to analyze these tweets about a company's stock price impact and determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me break this down step by step.

First, each tweet is about a specific stock symbol: goog, yelp, dks, eqt, etc. The task is to extract the target stock and then evaluate its performance based on the given tweets.

Looking at the first tweet: ""$ goog for $ yelp making the rounds."" It seems like they're talking about trends or buzz related to the company or their stock. I don't immediately recognize what this could mean, so maybe it's a bit unclear but probably not a major sentiment.

The second tweet is ""rt AT_USER AT_USER there was a $ goog takeover rumor for $ ebay floating around just now , which i suspect to be 100 % false , but …"" This seems like it's questioning the credibility of a rumor about a $ goog takeover happening on eBay. The mention of uncertainty and suggesting the rumor might not be true could lead investors to doubt the stock performance.

The third tweet is ""rt AT_USER google-owned AT_USER wants to buy gaming video site twitch.tv URL $ goog [ via ] via AT_USER."" This seems like a direct offer by Google to acquire Twitch, which is a streaming platform. Trading such stocks can affect prices significantly, so this is likely a positive factor because it could boost the stock price.

The fourth tweet: ""awesome stock research on $ dks $ eqt $ woof $ goog stock URL"" mentions multiple companies but doesn't provide specifics. It's about stock research, which can influence investor sentiment positively if it provides valuable information that supports growth.

The fifth tweet: ""$ goog google takes over tablet company pbct."" Similar to the third one, this is a specific acquisition. Google acquiring a tablet company could have a positive impact on the stock price, especially for a tech-focused company like goog.

Sixth tweet: ""goog google buys divide , an app which secures your device for work data URL"" Again, Google buying another app meant for securing devices, likely related to technology. This might be seen as a strategic move in the tech sector, contributing positively to the stock price.

The seventh tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ goog search isn't threatened by social search $ fb $ twtr $ lnkd URL."" This is about Google's position on privacy and security concerns raised by social media platforms. If there are concerns about data breaches or privacy issues, it could affect investor sentiment negatively if they worry about the company's reputation.

The eighth tweet: ""rt AT_USER will $ goog and $ ddd give $ aapl a run with project ara smartphone ? 3dprinting stocks investing."" This is talking about a potential merger between Google and another company aiming to invest in 3D printing. Such mergers can be significant but might depend on the specifics and potential synergies.

The ninth tweet: ""$ goog : microsoft takes on the macbook air with new surface pro 3 tablet URL"" This seems like Microsoft acquiring the MacBook Pro tablet, which is a tech move. It could affect股价 depending on Microsoft's position in the market.

Tenths: The last five tweets are about different technologies and companies, but without specific information, it's hard to assess their impact.

So, compiling these thoughts:

1. The third tweet has a clear positive action (buying a company) which is likely good news.
2. The second tweet questions the validity of a rumor, which could be seen as negative if uncertainty leads people to doubt.
3. The fourth and fifth tweets are about stock research, which can influence opinions positively.
4. The sixth tweet mentions an app for securing devices, which might support growth.
5. The seventh tweet concerns Google's privacy issues against social search platforms; it seems negative.

But I'm not sure if the uncertainty in the second tweet will lead to positive or negative sentiment. If people are uncertain about a rumor, they might split emotionally, but overall, it's hard to say for sure. Maybe it's a bit of a toss-up between positive and negative based on how many investors trust the information.

Considering all these factors, I think there's a mix of positive (buying, research) and some uncertainty and negative (privacy concerns). But probably not enough to completely determine the overall sentiment as [Positive], but more towards Neutral since there are conflicting signals."
2014-05-21,Positive,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to respond to this user's query. They provided a lot of market data and some stock recommendations over the last 10 days, ending with a long list of stocks to watch for next week. Now, they want me to come up with a single conclusion that ends with either ""Positive,"" ""Neutral,"" or ""Negative."" 

First, I'll go through their data. From day 43 to day 549, the sentiment seems mostly positive. The user is buying stocks like AMZN, FB, and GOOGL consistently every day. The technical stock recommendations are also pointing towards a positive outlook with expected gains.

Looking at the next 10 days, which started from October 20th, I see that some sectors are being watched, but the overall sentiment seems to be building up. The user is spreading their investments across multiple stocks, suggesting diversification, and they're not overly shorting any particular stock or sector. 

The user also mentions potential breakouts on certain dates like FB's Breakout Day 1, but I'm not sure about that. However, the focus seems to be on long-term expectations for these stocks rather than immediate price movements.

I don't see any signs of negative news or significant drops in stock prices. The recommendations are all positive, and the user is spreading their investments, which is a sign of diversification and confidence. There's no clear sell-off or warning about economic downturns that would typically cause negatives.

Considering all this, I think it's leaning towards a Positive conclusion for the overall sentiment. It's a blend of current trends that are optimistic and a strategic approach to managing risk through diversification."
2014-05-22,Negative,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to handle this query. The user provided a series of 93 tweets and some links, and they want me to come up with a conclusion using only three specific tags: Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

First, I'll start by reading through all the tweets carefully. It seems like most of them are about stock buy recommendations, product launches, and sometimes financial news. There's also a mix of positive and negative language throughout.

I notice that several tweets mention the intention to step into the company (like ""step in""), which usually implies interest or consideration. Others talk about the potential reward or benefits (like selling stocks) but don't explicitly state whether it's good or bad, just indicating optimism about the stock's performance.

Looking at the links provided, some are financial news related to goog and others seem irrelevant except for the one that links to a blog post. The main focus seems to be on buy orders targeting specific companies like msft (Microsoft), amzn (Amazon), intc (Investive Community Group), and maybe others mentioned in some tweets.

I'm trying to figure out if there's an overall trend here. Most of the suggestions are about buying stocks, which is a typical trading strategy. The links provided don't seem to indicate any major changes or positive indicators about the stock market itself. In fact, I don't see any mention of anything that would suggest optimism about economic growth, industry performance, or any other positive developments.

The negative language in some tweets suggests a cautious approach, but it's not explicitly stated whether this leads to loss or not. It's more about the sentiment towards entering into a trade than overall market sentiment.

Putting it all together, the main themes are buy orders and product launches without clear indicators of a positive outcome from these actions. The links provided don't seem to be related to any specific trends or positive news either.

Therefore, considering all this, I think the best fit is ""Neutral."" There's no significant evidence of positive sentiment here, but there are also no strong negatives that would make it more negative."
2014-05-23,Negative,"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to analyze the impact of seven tweets on a given company's stock price and determine whether it's positive, neutral, or negative.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. That seems straightforward since all tweets mention something related to Google (GOOG) or other companies in relation to Google.

Starting with tweet 1: ""looking for more info on $ siri $ ibkr $ cab $ goog nse URL"". This mentions SIRI, IBKR, CAB, and GOOG in the context of their URLs. Since I don't know which company SIRI or IBKR is, but both are known to be related to Google, it's likely they're discussing Google. So, the target stock is GOOG.

Looking at tweet 2: ""$ goog get a refund on apps in google play after 15 minutes URL"". This clearly mentions GOOG and talks about getting a refund for their Google Play app. It suggests that there might be an issue or improvement related to the app, which could influence investor sentiment positively.

Tweet 3 is ""regretting your investment in $ glng $ hp $ nycb $ goog singelinvestor URL"". The user is regretting investing in GOOG and another company, so this indicates disappointment or dissatisfaction with a stock purchase decision. That's a negative sign.

Tweet 4: ""$ 5 stocks you should be watching $ fnf $ grmn $ stt $ goog goto URL"". The user lists five stocks they should watch for GOOG. This is a call to action, suggesting that the company is in good financial shape and people are paying attention, which is positive.

Tweet 5: ""great pennystock research $ nve $ bsx $ tss $ goog financial URL"". Here, the user mentions their own stock, but it's unclear if it's related. If it's about an unrelated company, maybe there's a positive angle like better market conditions or a new product launch. But since it's speculative, it's hard to say for sure.

Tweet 6: ""do you need stock research on $ hii $ nue $ o $ goog liquidity URL"". Similar to tweet 3, the user is talking about GOOG and liquidity. They might be worried about liquidity issues or potential problems with the company's financial health, which could be negative.

Tweet 7: ""AT_USER AT_USER current $ hp layoffs equivalent to two $ fb's ; annual layoffs equivalent to one $ goog disruption"". This tweet mentions layoffs at HP and Google being disrupted. It seems like both companies are facing significant changes in their operations or leadership structures. Disruptions can cause concern among investors, leading to negative sentiment.

Now, let's summarize each tweet's impact:
1. SIRI, IBKR, CAB: Possibly GOOG.
2. refund for Google Play app: Positive.
3. Regretting investment in GOOG: Negative.
4. Stock watch: Positive.
5. General research on a stock: Possibly positive or negative without context.
6. Liquidity concerns: Could be negative.
7. Disruption due to layoffs: Negative.

Considering these points, the overall sentiment is a mix of some positive and some highly negative factors. While there's some investment activity and a mention of potential issues (disruption), the main negative factors come from tweet 3 and tweet 7. However, the other tweets suggest that GOOG might be doing well or has positive news, though it's not entirely clear without more context. Since some tweets are speculative about GOOG's financial status, the sentiment could vary.

Given that there is a clear call to action (tweet 4) and a possible underlying belief in their performance (since it's investment-focused), but the other negative tweets outweigh this. However, the problem statement asks for an overall conclusion based on the given information, not detailed analysis beyond what can be determined from the tweets.

Therefore, considering all the factors mentioned in the tweets, especially tweet 3 which is highly negative regarding GOOG's investment decision, and tweet 7 which is speculative about a disruption affecting GOOG. The dominant opinion seems to lean towards negative sentiment due to the clear mentions of dissatisfaction with investments."
2014-05-24,Neutral,"Okay, so I have these three tweets and I need to figure out their impact on a stock price for a company. Hmm, let me break it down step by step. First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. 

Looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER social media usage in europe : facebook and youtube lead ( infographic ) URL $ fb $ goog / AT_USER htt …"". Wait, that doesn't seem like a stock ticker. Maybe it's not related to a specific company? Or perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the stock symbol is ""AT_USER""? But I don't recognize that as a stock code.

Wait, maybe each tweet has a stock name or ticker in there. Let me check again. The first tweet mentions ""facebook"" and ""youtube"", which are both companies. So maybe the target stock is Facebook? Or maybe it's another company like Meta or Google? But looking at the other tweets, I see mentions of Google and Apple as well.

The second tweet: ""$ goog google developing 3 - d depth-sensing tablets , report says URL"". This looks like a news about Google products. The term ""depth-sensing tablets"" is related to their latest devices. So maybe the target stock here is Google? But I'm not entirely sure because it's just one word, ""goog"", which might refer to the company name.

The third tweet: ""$ goog google poaches l'oreal cmo marc speichert to court brands URL"". This also mentions Google but then talks about Poaching a CMO, Marc Speichert. That seems unrelated because Marc Speichert isn't a known person or brand, and it doesn't mention any specific stock ticker.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the tweets. Let me think again. The first tweet seems to be providing information related to social media usage without a specific stock name. The second is about Google's new technology, which is a significant news for the company. The third tweet seems out of context as it mentions someone else.

Since the first tweet doesn't provide a clear target stock symbol, I might not have enough info to determine its impact on any stock. However, if we consider that ""goog"" in the second tweet refers to Google's stock, then that could be a potential factor. But without knowing the exact company or context, it's hard to gauge sentiment.

If I had to guess, maybe the overall sentiment is Neutral because while there's mention of Google products, the tweet doesn't provide enough specific information to influence the stock price positively or negatively. The first tweet might be more about a trend or social media engagement without any financial implications."
2014-05-25,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on Google's stock price.

First, I need to understand what each tweet is saying. The first one mentions an interview with Walt Mossberg and Kara Shisher at Google, which sounds positive because it's talking about a company event. It could boost investor confidence, so that's a positive factor.

The second tweet talks about Google dealing highlighting the risk of leaving employees to their own devices. This seems like a negative point because it's worried about how people will treat their work spaces if they're left to do it without supervision or feedback. That could lead to legal issues and possibly lower productivity, which might affect revenue. So that's a negative factor.

The third tweet mentions Google developing a tablet with advanced vision capabilities. This is definitely positive because advancements in tech can drive innovation and potentially increase revenue, especially if the tablet becomes popular. But it also makes me think about how this relates to their overall business strategy and future projects.

Now, let's look at the factors and sentiments. Positive factors are the interview with Mossberg and the new tablet. The negative factor is the deal highlighting the risk of leaving employees to their own devices. 

To assess the sentiment impact, I need to weigh these factors against each other. While the tablet development is positive and could lead to growth, the employee concerns might have an adverse effect. But given that Google has been investing in projects like the Pixel tablets, which were a success, this trend suggests they're moving into new markets or product lines, which usually leads to growth.

However, I also have to consider how much each tweet contributes. The tablet development seems more immediate and direct, while the employee risk is somewhat long-term but still a significant concern. 

I think that overall, while there's some negative sentiment due to the employee issue, the positive factors like the tablet and potential future growth from other projects are stronger. So the combined sentiment might be leaning towards [Neutral], suggesting moderate expectations about the stock."
2014-05-26,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets regarding the stock price impact on goog. First, I need to identify each tweet and their factors.

Looking at the first tweet, ""stock markets not playing nice today 😒 anyone know if $ goog is going to go up anything soon ? nyse google"" seems neutral because it's just asking for information without any positive or negative indicators. 

The second tweet mentions that google's head of search got a card from church but can't solve every problem, which might be seen as negative because of the religious aspect and potential criticism. However, it doesn't directly relate to the stock price yet.

Third tweet is a call to subscribe for a penny stock picks gaining 4,000% this year. This seems positive because it suggests a good investment opportunity.

Fourth tweet talks about self-driving cars on california roads, which is positive since self-driving is a growing trend.

Fifth tweet says they'll release a tablet with advanced vision but only for certain roads. This is neutral as it doesn't specify if it's helpful or not without more context.

Sixth tweet mentions an upcoming eu settlement in danger, which might be negative because unexpected developments can affect the stock price.

Putting these together: Positive tweets are 3 and 4; Negative are 1, 5, 6. Since there are both positive and negative factors but some overlap, it's a mix that's likely neutral."
2014-05-27,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative in terms of their impact on the stock price of the company they're talking about. Let's see how I can approach this.

First, from the provided tweets, each one seems to be either a recommendation from someone looking for a . (like at_user) or talking about something else. Each tweet is numbered from 1 to 26, and each one is in the format of something like ""rt AT_USER $ cpsl bullish engulfing pattern ..."". These seem to be posts from different people discussing trends or stock developments.

I remember the process outlined before: I need to identify the target stock symbol, then analyze each tweet into positive (Plus) and negative (Minus) factors, evaluate their sentiment, and then sum up overall impact. But in this case, since all tweets are about stock symbols without a clear company name, maybe I just focus on the other parts of the tweets.

Looking at each tweet:

1. $ goog: 3 reasons why Twitter killed the SoundCloud URL.
2. himax $ himx falls as rumors swirl about AT_USER breakup : URL $ goog
3. rt AT_USER $ amot URL $ ge should buy this company out or someone else $ dia $ qqq $ spy $ aapl $ goog $ fb $ twtr $ newl $ …

Hmm, the main stock mentioned in tweet 1 is Google. Then in tweets 2 and 3, it's talking about ""AT_USER"" which likely refers to another company, maybe AT_USER stock? But I'm not sure if that's relevant for predicting Google's stock.

From tweets 4 onwards: $ goog response to recent $ aapl story? It says nested will not turn into a billboard URL. So Google is reacting to something related to Apple (AAPL). This could be positive or negative depending on the context.

Tweets 5-7 are all about ""rt AT_USER $ cpsl bullish engulfing pattern ..."", which might indicate some stock performance, like if someone thinks there's an uptrend that won't reverse. These could be indicators of technical analysis, but without more context, it's hard to tell if it's positive or negative.

Tweets 8-13 are about Google's smart home products and their acquisition. The idea is whether Google will up their 'smart home' ante by acquiring a company like DropCam. This seems like a potential buy signal for Google, which could be positive but also might lead to some positive sentiment around the company.

Tweets 14-26 are about Intel (INTC) and other tech companies, mentioning something with raymond james or Barron's reports. These seem more like news events that could impact stock prices on a variety of fronts.

Now, considering the overall impact:

- Positive tweets: If someone is looking for Google products, buying their stock could be positive. Also, if they see Google making money from others, which might signal growth.
- Neutral: If there are no clear up or down signals but just general market sentiment without specific context about the company.
- Negative: If all relevant tweets indicate negative information that would decrease investor confidence.

Looking at each tweet:

- Tweets 1 and 2 mention Google, so they're definitely related to it. The user is talking about their experience with SoundCloud and rumors about AT_USER's breakup. It doesn't seem positive or negative for Google unless there's a specific reason to think about Apple.
  
- Tweets 3,4,5,...: These talk about the company offering something, reacting to news, etc. They might be providing some info that could lead investors' perceptions, but without clear indicators of up or down trends.

- Tweets 8 onwards: Google's acquisition ideas and product developments. This could indicate potential for growth in tech, which might be positive but depends on how it aligns with the company's strategy.

Putting this together, I think these tweets are providing some context that could influence investor sentiment about Google, perhaps adding to their expectations or giving them a reason to buy, making them somewhat positive. But since there are also negative events and just general market news, it might not be all positive or all negative.

So overall sentiment seems like it's leaning towards positive because of the potential for growth in tech with Google, but I'm not 100% sure."
2014-05-28,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the given company. The user provided a set of tweets and told me how to analyze them. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the target stock is ""brk"". I should probably check if ""brk"" is an actual stock symbol or something else. But from what I know, ""Brk"" isn't a real stock symbol. Wait, maybe it's a typo? Or perhaps it refers to a different context. Hmm, that might complicate things.

Looking at the tweets:

1. The first tweet talks about $ag stocks and mentions metrics like met $emc $goog investing. That sounds like a mix of short sell and investing strategies.
2. The second tweet is about AT_USER providing news ongoog, msft, etc., so it's about tech companies.
3. Third tweet is similar to the first one, focusing on cab stocks and goog investments.
4. Fourth tweet mentions future shock with google unveiling a driverless car, which could be positive if that impact is good for the stock.
5. Fifth tweet talks about penny stocks gaining 4000% and suggesting subscription, so it's a bit of a sales pitch.
6. Sixth tweet is about zbra, gwr, tkr, goog, looking for an opinion on goog.
7. Seventh tweet is a big picture report from Odyssey Trading Group, mentioning spy, goog, qqq, aapl, dia stocks.
8. Eighth tweet is similar to the fourth one, maybe another driverless car announcement?
9. Ninth tweet talks about trn, tsco, nav, goog for breakout time.
10. Tenth tweet about google building self-driving cars via AT_USER, which could be positive if it's a good idea.
11. Eleventh tweet is about wmt, znga, vmi, goog financial news.
12. Twelfth tweet mentions apple and google being under-owned for good news on goog.
13. Thirteenth tweet is about defensive portfolio focusing on competitive advantage.
14. Fourteenth tweet talks about nest being hot for ""smart homes.""
15. Fifteenth tweet asks for more info on fmc, azo, hpq, goog investing.
16. Sixteenth tweet does a pennystock research on brk, ntap, spw, goog.

Now, considering all these tweets, the main positive points seem to be from the fifth and tenth tweets about self-driving cars, which could positively influence the stock of ""brk."" The others are more about tech companies or market news. Since ""brk"" isn't a known stock, maybe they're either hypothetical or based on some other context.

But since I don't have information about ""brk,"" it's hard to say definitively whether these tweets affect its price negatively or positively. However, given that the fifth tweet is promising for self-driving cars, which could be a positive indicator if ""brk"" is related to that sector or has potential in that area.

So, overall sentiment seems mixed because some are positive and others are more about general market movements rather than specific stock performance. But leaning towards positive because of the upcoming tech trend. Maybe neutral as well since not all tweets point significantly."
2014-05-29,Positive,"Okay, so I need to determine whether each tweet affects the stock price of a given company and then decide if it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet is about Google being biased in real-time trade alerts. It mentions diversity issues. Hmm, this could be positive because it might attract more investment. But the fact that Google is doing unbiased trading alerts sounds like a good sign for their stock, so maybe this is positive.

2. The second tweet seems to repeat the same thing as the first one. It's about Google's bias. Again, similar reasoning: positive because it could boost stock prices.

3. The third tweet talks about diversity at Google and mentions Apple in relation to iHome success starting with the iPhone. This suggests that Google is focusing on diversification and tech advancements. I think this could positively influence the stock as more companies might be looking towards global expansion or technology sectors.

4. The fourth tweet mentions that smartphone shipments reached 1.2 billion units in 2014, which affects the smartphone industry. But it's about 2014, so unless the data is relevant now, maybe not too impactful on the current stock. Still, since it's an industry-related news, it could be positive.

5. The fifth tweet repeats the same biased trade alert as before. It’s a repeat of a tweet from the first one, so likely reinforces the same sentiment towards Google's unbiased trading alerts.

6. Similar to the third tweet but also mentions diversity and Apple. This repetition would reinforce the positive outlook on Google, especially with tech companies focusing on global expansion.

7. The seventh tweet is about Apple being successful in iHome. Apple's success could lead to increased interest in Google's stock as competitors grow. This could be a positive factor for Google's growth.

8. The eighth tweet again mentions real-time trade alerts and 12 other stocks. It doesn't provide specific details on the company, but it's about unbiased news, so maybe some positive influence here too.

9. Another biased trade alert from Google. It's likely reinforcing the previous sentiment towards Google being a good investment due to unbiased trading alerts.

10. The tenth tweet is about Google's new driverless car without any physical controls. This is more of an innovation story but could positively affect Google as they might need more investment in vehicles, which ties into their stock performance.

11. The eleventh tweet mentions workforce diversity stats from Google. More women and men working at Google could mean more diversity, which Google can leverage to expand their market presence, possibly boosting the stock.

12. The twelfth tweet asks if someone is considering selling certain stocks. This seems like a negative action because it's diverting attention away from the company being analyzed here. It might cause confusion and reduce investor confidence.

13. The thirteenth tweet is about Google releasing workforce stats for diversity. This would be another positive sign, possibly increasing interest in their product development as they invest more in diversity.

14. The fourteenth tweet is a bearish or bullish opinion on the company's stock. Without knowing who ""these stocks"" are, it could be either. If it's about a specific tech giant, maybe it has some support from analysts, but if not, it's neutral.

15. An unrelated tweet about financial news. It seems out of context, so probably not relevant to the stock being analyzed here.

16. The fifteenth tweet asks about Google's next billion-dollar partner. This could be a positive sign as more opportunities in tech companies are expanding into big deals. It might attract capital and boost stock prices.

17. A surprising report from Google that 70% of employees are men and over 60% white. This is definitely positive because it's about the company's workforce composition, which can drive growth and innovation. So this is a strong positive.

18. Another opinion statement by Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google. He speaks about the need to forget something, which might be controversial but could influence investor sentiment. Depending on his tone, it could either push for positive or negative action.

19. The twentieth tweet says to avoid mistakes like financial news. It seems to encourage avoiding certain content related to financial markets, which could lead to reduced interest in Google's stock because investors avoid information that might affect their investments negatively.

20. Another opinion statement from Sergey Brin about developing autonomous cars. This is again about the future of tech and innovation, so it's a positive sign for Google's growth prospects.

Now, compiling all these, some tweets are reinforcing positive trends (like iHome success, diversity stats, new car development), others are slightly negative (considering selling stocks). The overall sentiment seems to lean towards a mix of positive and mixed signals. But considering that the majority of these tweets point towards Google's expansion in tech areas with diverse efforts, I would lean towards a positive impact on the stock."
2014-05-30,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about the stock price impact on the given company. I'm not very experienced in financial analysis, but I'll do my best.

First, looking at the target stock symbol. It's missing from all the tweets, so maybe it's a typo or something? The user just mentioned ""given company,"" so perhaps they expect me to pick one based on some standard? Hmm, maybe I can look for other patterns instead. Let me see the tweets again.

The first tweet has $ ges $ goog $ aapl $ msft $ expr market pulse: 10 billion worries for bnp , thomson reuters : reuters insider URL. That seems to be about BNP or Thomson Re, but not a known company. The second one talks about why keep investments in one place, which might be related to diversification or risk management. The third is looking for research on $ gntx $ dhr $ cvi $ goog liquidity.

Looking at the other tweets: they mention various companies like mercenary links, mutual funds, ETFs, and sectors. Some are positive about investing based on algorithms, others are talking about market performance with terms like ""best investments,"" ""rock the markets,"" and mentions of gold, goldmines, commodities, etc. There's also something about market movements, like 14-day gains.

Wait, I think I might have misread one of the tweets earlier. Let me check again. The fourth tweet is $ goog $ aapl $ inp $ eurusd $ tan, which includes Tesla, Apple, Intel, Eurusd, and a tangent about mutual funds or ETFs. The fifth is about investing based on algorithms with 5.08% gains over 14 days. The sixth is even more varied: ""let's rock the markets ! ! ! $ oodh $ brk $ mcd $ aol $ nflx $ tsla $ mmm $ gold $ iau $ gmcr $ wmt $ vz $ ko $ aapl $ fb $ pgol $ iag $ cat $ aa $ goog $ p $ c"". This seems to be an unrelated tweet, possibly promotional or just some words.

So the target stock is missing, but looking at other tweets, I see several mentions of Tesla (TSLA) and Microsoft (MSFT). The fourth tweet specifically includes TSLA with ""intel"" in it. That's a significant point because MSFT is a well-known company in tech, often associated with growth.

Looking back to the target stock symbol missing from most tweets, maybe it's a typo or perhaps I'm supposed to infer based on other symbols? Or maybe the user forgot to include it. If the target stock isn't clear, I might have to make an assumption. But since the fourth tweet includes TSLA, that could indicate they're focusing on Tesla.

Now, analyzing each tweet: The first mentions BNP and Thomson Re but doesn't give sentiment. The second talks about investing, so that's positive. The third is about research on Google's liquidity. The fourth specifically says ""intel,"" which is a key component of Microsoft. The fifth talks about mutual funds with growth potential. The sixth is unrelated.

So considering the tweets related to TSLA, like the fourth and the others, there are mentions of gains from algorithms (fifth) and some ETFs or ETFs discussing ETFs in the sixth. However, without specific positive or negative language from other tweets, it's hard to gauge sentiment. But since TSLA is a big name and many tweets mention its growth potential, especially with ""intel"" and ""gig economy,"" which are sectors that are growing.

Additionally, some tweets are talking about keeping investments in one place (second tweet), which might indicate diversification. However, without more context, it's tough to tell if this is positive or negative. But the fifth tweet mentions 5% gains over 14 days, which could be seen as a positive outlook for investors.

Putting it all together: Some tweets are positive about the company's growth in sectors like tech and internet, others mention diversification strategies. However, without explicit language that leans positive or negative, it's challenging. But given that TSLA is a major player and several tweets highlight its potential, especially with mentions of ""gig economy"" and related companies, I might lean towards a positive overall sentiment.

Wait, but one tweet says ""10 billion worries for bnp , thomson reuters : reuters insider URL."" That's unclear. It could be a typo or unrelated. The other tweets don't have any explicit language about the company's performance or market impact beyond general mentions.

So maybe it's safer to assume the overall sentiment is neutral because while there are positive tweets, others are too vague or unrelated. Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating and should consider that since TSLA is a significant company in tech with many growth-oriented tweets, the sentiment might lean towards positive."
2014-05-31,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company based on their analysis. The user provided five tweets and asked for an assessment using ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"".

First, I'll look at each tweet individually and try to extract what they're saying.

1. ""rt AT_USER 60 % of top 25 tech companies founded by 1st & 2nd generation americans ( immigrants ) -> $ aapl $ goog $ orcl $ amzn $ ebay http …"" Hmm, this seems like an outreach message from an AI to investors, encouraging them to check out some stocks. It's positive because it's promoting stock research and might be trying to attract investment interest.

2. ""do you need stock research on $ plcm $ oxy $ wdc $ goog money URL"" This is a direct question asking about stock research for specific companies. While it's seeking information, the context doesn't give much context about whether this will positively or negatively affect the stock price. It could either go up if they see opportunities or down if there are concerns.

3. ""seeking the next stock like $ gra $ jnj $ bk $ goog give it a try URL"" Another call to action for investors, suggesting that some stocks might be better than others and asking them to try. Positive because it's encouraging research and could drive up stock prices by attracting interested investors.

4. ""this weeks stocks you should watch $ sbny $ adi $ tup $ goog wealthmanagement URL"" Again, a call to action. The company is promoting their own stock and mentions wealth management as part of the suggestion. While it might attract some attention, the emphasis on their own stock could help increase investor interest.

5. ""$ goog nexus 8 apt for gaming as google tablet set to pack 64 - bit tegra chipset URL"" This is a technical tweet suggesting that Google's next product (Nexasense?) will be good for gaming. It might attract some technical enthusiasts, but if it's unrelated or unclear in context, the impact on stock could be minimal or even negative due to market reactions.

6. ""$ lvs $ csx $ bll $ goog stockmarket URL"" Another call to action. The target is a company whose name isn't familiar, and the URL suggests something about their stock. It's positive because it's encouraging others to research but doesn't provide specific information that could drive price changes.

7. ""$ im $ joe $ wtr $ goog financialnews URL"" Similar to the first tweet, another outreach message encouraging researchers. Positive for attracting interest.

Now, combining these thoughts: The user provided seven tweets aimed at persuading investors to do stock research or check out specific stocks. They don't provide specific information about upcoming news or trends that could affect the stock price. Many of them are more about reaching out rather than making recommendations. However, some emphasize Google's upcoming tech product line, which might attract interested investors but doesn't necessarily lead to a clear positive or negative outcome.

But given the context, some tweets (like #1 and #3) clearly suggest that investors will be considered, possibly pushing them into action. The lack of specific technical updates from Google in some tweets could make it harder for those to predict significant price movements.

So overall, these tweets are more about encouraging investment interest rather than providing concrete information that would lead to a stock price change. Therefore, the sentiment is neutral."
2014-06-01,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price of a company, which in this case is Google (GOOG). Let me take each tweet one by one and see what they're saying.

Starting with the first tweet: ""are you looking for more winners like $ swi $ kss $ ntap $ goog give it a try URL"". Hmm, that sounds like someone wants to find new investment ideas. They might be interested in stocks similar to Google because of the $ goog keyword. But I'm not sure if this is positive or negative towards GOOG specifically.

Next tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ goog - netflix is spending its price hike , are investors set up for a fall ? -> URL stock stocks s …"". This seems to indicate that there's concern about netflix's pricing change possibly affecting investors. It might be pulling investor confidence down, which could make GOOG's stock appear riskier or less attractive.

Third tweet: ""is it breakout time on $ znga $ cmg $ atw $ goog wealthmanagement URL"". Breakout time suggests a potential significant move in the stock price. If Google is expected to change direction soon, that could be a positive signal because it might open up new opportunities for investors.

Fourth tweet: ""stocks you migh want to sell $ dds $ gmt $ ice $ goog view now URL"". This looks like a call for action—maybe someone wants to sell GOOG shares. That's usually negative because selling shares can reduce demand and potentially lower the stock price.

Fifth tweet: ""get more info on $ fnfg $ nu $ chk $ goog investing URL"". Another call for information, but it's about investment strategies. It might be used by others who want to learn more before making a decision, which could encourage market participation rather than just selling shares.

Sixth tweet: ""$ alle stocks to watch this week $ ppg $ rost $ goog liquidity URL"". This seems like an update on the company's liquidity. If Google is seen as liquid (able to trade easily), it might indicate good news for investors. Good liquidity can attract more buyers and keep prices stable or rise.

Seventh tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ goog : europe has put google's search business on a slippery slope : first day of ' right-to-be-forgotten ' pulls 12,000 ' de …"". This is critical because it points out a potential problem in Google's search functionality. The term 'right-to-be-forgotten' suggests something is going wrong that could affect the company's operations and thus its stock value.

Eighth tweet: ""$ goog : why intel and Microsoft led the dow higher this week URL"". This indicates that investing in GOOG can be profitable, especially since both Intel and Microsoft have strong track records. It might encourage investors to buy shares because they think it will drive the Dow Jones Industrial Average up.

Now, summarizing each tweet's impact:
1. Looks like someone wants new investment ideas.
2. Concern about netflix's pricing affecting investors' confidence.
3. Suggests Google could experience significant price changes.
4. Encourages selling shares as an exit strategy.
5. Offers more information but not a direct sell.
6. Points out potential liquidity issues, which can be bad for investors.
7. Critiques Google's search business, which is often seen as a key part of the company.
8. Suggests investing in GOOG could be profitable.

Looking at all these, the positive tweets include mentions of new investment ideas, potential profitability through Intel/Microsoft, and any news about Google itself (like liquidity). The negative tweets concern netflix's pricing change, search issues, and investors' confidence from netflix.

I think the overall sentiment is mixed. Some tweets are positive in terms of attracting attention or suggesting investments, but others are negative due to concerns about competitors or other factors like search functionality. It's a bit tricky without more context, but considering these points, maybe it leans towards [Neutral] because while there's some positive info, there's also significant negative sentiment from other companies and investor uncertainty."
2014-06-02,Negative,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a given company. The user provided a list of tweets, and each tweet seems to be about different topics related to internet access through satellites or other tech-related things.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the tweets, there's one that mentions "" stocks"" multiple times, including ""goog stocks,"" which probably refers to Google's stock. So, the company in question is likely Google.

Next, for each tweet, I have to separate the factors into positive and negative. But since these tweets are very short or contain multiple sentences, it might be a bit tricky. For example, one tweet says, ""rt AT_USER google preve ampliar el acceso a internet vía satélite $ goog stocks."" That seems like a combination of Google extending internet access via satellites and increasing their stock value.

I should analyze each tweet to see if they are positive or negative regarding the stock. However, some tweets mention multiple things at once, which could be seen as contradictory or conflicting information. For example, ""cooking should be comparing maverick to android and chrome and not the limping windows 8."" That sounds critical but seems a bit off because it's about a cooking comparison, which might not relate to stock sentiment.

Another tweet mentions Google investing $1-3 billion on satellites for internet access. This is positive as it shows potential growth, so that would be a positive factor. However, other tweets talk about negative things like overvalued stocks or limited growth in small-cap stocks, which might make the overall sentiment uncertain.

I also noticed some repeated mentions of Google's stock ""goog stocks"" and other related terms. It seems to be reinforcing the idea that there are multiple conflicting factors affecting the stock price. Since it's hard to assess each tweet individually without context, I should consider the overall trend.

Looking at the tweets, they mention Google spending money on satellites, which is a positive sign for internet infrastructure and potential growth in the company. However, some tweets also point out that these investments might be overvalued or that small-cap stocks are rising, suggesting possible negative factors impacting the stock price.

I'm not sure if all the information is accurate or if there's no clear consensus on the stock price based on these mixed signals. The conflicting statements could make it hard to determine a strong overall sentiment.

Since I can't combine multiple aspects into one positive, neutral, or negative conclusion without more context, maybe the answer should be neutral because there are signs of both positive and negative developments."
2014-06-03,Positive,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this query where someone has written a bunch of text and asked me to conclude with a single tag—either positive, neutral, or negative. They provided that I must use one of those exact tags.

First, I need to read through the entire text carefully. It seems like there are multiple paragraphs discussing various topics, including tech companies, stocks, services, and even some unrelated stuff about apple and google features. The content is quite varied, covering stock market news, tech company discussions, and even a query that's more of an informational note about features.

I notice that the text mentions ""apple"" in places like ""apple’s new services are a hail mary to beat google,"" which suggests they're looking at potential investment opportunities. There are also questions about where to get apple iOS 8 features now, which seems like something someone might be researching for.

Given all this, the overall sentiment is positive because there's an interest in stocks and tech companies, especially around companies that are being discussed or mentioned. The focus seems on potential investments and discussions related to technology trends rather than negative comments about businesses.

So, considering all these points, I should conclude with [Positive]."
2014-06-04,Negative,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to respond to this query. So, the user has provided a lengthy conversation history where a user is talking about investing in Google and Amazon stock, specifically mentioning terms like "" chinese media attack google"" which seems like they're skeptical or critical of China's influence on these companies.

The task is to conclude with a single line stating the overall sentiment using one of three tags: Positive, Neutral, Negative. Hmm, so I need to analyze the entire conversation and see what the user is really saying about Google and Amazon.

Looking at the conversation history, the user seems pretty vocal. They mention attacks by Chinese media on Google, which makes me think they're not happy with how these companies are doing because of external factors like China's policies. They might be looking for advice from others who are more in line with their views or seeking tips to improve.

So, putting it all together, the sentiment here is definitely negative because of the skepticism towards external influences on the companies' performance and business practices. There are no positive comments about their stock prices or strategies. The criticism toward Chinese media adds to that negative sentiment.

Therefore, the overall sentiment should be Negative."
2014-06-05,Negative,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. 

First, looking at the list provided, I see 33 tweets from the same user discussing whether to buy or sell Amazon stock. All the tweets are about buying $grpn groupon for a certain amount over $8 per share. They mention topics like social media ads, newsletter subscribers, and other tech companies.

The target tweet is trying to decide between buying or selling AMZN based on a specific deal. The user seems to be expressing uncertainty but seems confident in the decision. 

I think the key here is that the user is making an informed decision without being overly emotional. They might be looking for support if they don't want to risk their money, which shows some strategic thinking. However, this isn't a clear positive sign; it's more like a balanced approach.

Looking at other tweets, most of them just repeat the same sentiment. The user is talking about other companies but doesn't provide any positive or negative indicators that could suggest Amazon's performance. 

I'm not sure if this tweet is actually predicting anything. It's mostly repeating a trend and personal opinions rather than providing specific data or financial information. So, it might be considered neutral because the impact isn't clear on Amazon's stock price.

Therefore, I think this tweet doesn't present any positive, negative, or neutral indicators about Amazon. So, the overall sentiment is neutral."
2014-06-06,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me start by going through each tweet one by one and see what information they're giving.

The first tweet says that Google's Chrome browsers are becoming the most popular in the US. That sounds positive because more people are using their internet tools, which can boost sales. So that's a good sign for the stock price.

Then, another tweet repeats the same point about Chrome being popular. Repeating it is probably just emphasizing the same thing again, so maybe not adding much new information beyond what was already said before.

The third tweet also says Google's Chrome browsers are the most popular in the US. Again, repeating something from the first tweet. It seems like we're seeing a consistent pattern here.

Looking at tweet number 4, it mentions value investing and how changing a strategy could impact the stock. Hmm, that sounds a bit more technical. Value investing can affect stock price depending on market conditions and whether the company is undervalued. I'm not sure about the overall impact yet; it's probably something to keep in mind.

Tweet 5 talks about businesses getting an option to add a hangout button to their websites. Hangout buttons are used for remote work, so this could be related to productivity or e-commerce growth. That sounds like it might boost the company's sales because more people would use these features. So that's another positive point.

Tweet 6 mentions bullish sentiment on specific stocks: alb, trow, pnw, goog research. That's multiple stocks being viewed positively. Maybe those are different companies related to Google or part of a network? I'm not sure about the exact impact yet.

Tweet 7 is about digesting WWD C, which probably relates to their services like cloud computing or data management. So they're looking at how these services could affect the stock. It might have some short-term effect but overall it's unclear if it's positive or negative.

Tweets 8 and 9 are similar again to tweet 2 and 3, repeating the popularity of Google's Chrome browsers in the US. Maybe just reinforcing existing information without adding new insights.

Tweet 10 talks about Starwood Hotels App targeting Google Glass. That could be related to their services if they're using Google Cloud for something like hotel management or data processing. Depending on how successful that is, it might positively impact the stock price.

Finally, tweet 11 suggests holding or adding to several stocks: XEC, TER, GOOG, etc. Again, multiple items are being discussed here, and the suggestion could be about diversification or growth opportunities in those areas. This is a bit vague but gives an idea of how the company's stock might perform.

Putting it all together, the tweets are mostly positive with some technical topics (tweets 4, 5, 10). The repeated mentions of Chrome popularity and related services suggest that there's optimism about market growth or product adoption. The other tweets touch on value investing but don't give specific details, which could make their impact uncertain. Overall, the stock seems to have several positive indicators but it's hard to tell if they outweigh any negative points."
2014-06-07,Neutral,"Alright, let's figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for Goog Inc., which has the symbol GOOG.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking through each tweet, it seems that many of them mention ""GOOG"" or parts of its name like ""GOM"" or ""GOOGLE"". So, the target stock is definitely GOOG.

Next, for each tweet, I should separate the factors and assess the sentiment. But since the user provided a summary from previous interactions, I can use that instead of analyzing each tweet individually here.

The overall tweets seem to be discussing various topics related to stocks, such as research on Apple (AAPL), Google's economic prospects, or stock performance over time. There are mentions of experts' opinions and updates about stock gains or overvaluation.

Looking at the sentiment, some tweets express bullish sentiments towards certain stocks, others are neutral, and a few indicate bearishness. However, without specific details on how each tweet affects investor behavior, it's challenging to assign exact sentiment levels like [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative].

But since many of these tweets mention gains in the stock market over time (e.g., ""past week"" with a 450% gain), and some talk about economic trends affecting companies like ""grows rapidly"", this suggests that there's ongoing activity related to Goog. Positive factors might lead to more investors feeling optimistic, which could drive prices up.

However, without clear-cut statements on overall sentiment, it's safer to assume a [Neutral] stance because the impact isn't consistent or overwhelming."
2014-06-08,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. The task is to determine if they are positive, neutral, or negative.

First, I'll extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. 

1. ""find the next hot pennystock $ cinf $ nlsn $ goog $ slw money URL"" – The word ""pennystock"" doesn't ring a bell for a company's symbol.
2. ""todays movers to research $ kors $ anf $ pdm $ goog must see URL"" – Again, the stock symbols are missing.
3. ""latest information on stocks like $ vnta $ kro $ mhk $ goog wallstreet URL"" – VNTA, KRO, MHK... those don't look familiar either.
4. ""are you bearish on these stocks $ enr $ mar $ lgf $ goog economy URL"" – Symbol is LRF (LARGE MANagers). I'm not sure about LRF stock.
5. ""todays movers to research $ mhfi $ axs $ mb $ goog visit URL"" – MHFI, AXS, MB. These don't correspond to any known companies.

Since the target stock symbols are missing from each tweet, it's impossible to determine their impact on the stock price. Each tweet seems to be about other stocks or topics unrelated to the company in question. Therefore, I can't assess the positive, neutral, or negative sentiment of these tweets towards a specific stock.

I'll conclude that without the target stock symbols, it's impossible to evaluate any impact."
2014-06-09,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a given company. The goal is to determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the tweets provided, all of them end with ""goog,"" so that means the stock in question is Google. That narrows things down because I can focus on how these tweets affect Google's performance.

Now, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. Positive factors are usually things that would likely benefit a company or increase their value, while negative factors might lead to decreased value. Each tweet seems to be expressing expectations about the stock, either optimistic (high) or pessimistic (low).

Starting with tweet 1: ""ready 4the road : cool glasses , cool maps , cool glasses | google cars willtransportyouin ubercool waze $ goog $ googl URL."" This one is pretty positive. It mentions Google's services like Uber and Waze, which are related to the company and likely increase their stock value. So this tweet is clearly a positive factor.

Moving on to tweet 2: ""$ goog what it's like when san francisco's anarchists picket your house just because ... URL."" This seems a bit unclear but mentions San Francisco's anarchists taking action, which could be seen as a way to influence investor sentiment. It might make people think more about Google, potentially causing some positive reaction in the stock market.

Tweet 3: ""$ jbl small-cap stocks making 52 - wk highs $ ori $ wtw $ goog check out URL."" Positive here is clear—the tweet is suggesting that jbl's small-cap stocks are rising over the next week. This would likely boost Google's confidence, adding to the overall positive sentiment.

Tweet 4: ""$ goog google inc ( goog ) , microsoft corporation ( msft ) among five most popular ... URL."" This seems neutral because it mentions two major companies but doesn't directly mention Google or its stock performance. It might just be labeling other companies as ""most popular,"" so I can't assume much about the company itself.

Tweet 5: ""are you investing in $ bmr $ dis $ rdc $ goog must have URL."" This tweet is asking if investors are considering Google, but it's not making a direct statement on the stock price. It might be more of a call to action rather than affecting sentiment.

Tweet 6: ""‘ price is what you pay ; value is what you get . ’ ~ benjamin graham ➔ ➔ ➔ $ oodh $ vz $ ko $ mmm $ mcd $ aol $ nflx $ c $ dji $ qqq $ wmt $ abx $ goog $ iag"" This quote from Benjamin Graham is known to be positive. It's about valuation, suggesting that if you want value, you'd pay the right price. This aligns with buying Google for a good return, so this tweet adds positive sentiment.

Tweet 7: ""find more winners like $ ugi $ mkl $ slb $ goog view now URL."" Positive again—mentioning other tech companies as potential winners, which could boost confidence in Google's stock performance.

Tweet 8: ""get research on $ sc $ anss $ fcx $ goog try this URL"" This seems like a call to action for investors. It might suggest that if they want research or more info, they can look into Google and another company. But since it doesn't directly mention Google's stock performance, the sentiment here is neutral because it's not providing positive information about Google.

Tweet 9: ""our $ aapl $ fb $ spy calls rockin ' hard - lovin it URL $ goog $ nflx $ fb $ vxx $ pcln $ f $ gm $ tsla $ qqq $ spy $ amzn $ yy $ rio"" This tweet is all about tech stocks related to Google. It mentions specific stocks like Apple, Facebook, and Tesla, which are in the same industry or have overlapping technologies. The mention of multiple tech companies could indicate strong fundamentals, contributing positively to the stock price.

Tweet 10: ""seeking the next hot pennystock $ aria $ ggp $ asbc $ goog nasdaq URL"" Again, this is a call to action. It's about looking for a new hot stock, which might not directly affect Google's performance but could influence investor sentiment positively if the company is seen as a candidate.

Tweet 11: ""tods stocks you should be watching $ wcn $ thc $ drc $ goog must see URL"" This tweet is all about stocks that are being watched. It suggests that Google needs to watch certain companies, which might mean increased interest in them. This could boost investor confidence and lead to a positive sentiment for Google's stock.

Tweet 12: ""latest information on stocks like $ reg $ se $ pru $ goog liquidity URL"" Similar to tweet 10, this is a call to action for investors looking at Google's liquidity. It might encourage buying more shares of Google, contributing to a positive sentiment.

Tweet 13: ""$ cme awesome stock research $ aon $ aiz $ goog financialnews URL"" Positive here as well—mentioning Google in the context of stock research, which can lead to increased demand for their services and shares. This would add to the overall positive impact on the stock price.

Lastly, tweet 14: ""rt AT_USER $ aapl $ goog $ fb $ twtr $ nflx $ ayi 135 call 22 nov op : 6.5 $ high : 16 $"" This seems like an informational tweet about Google's performance and its position on the stock chart. It might provide details that could influence market behavior, potentially making investors more optimistic.

Tweet 15: ""awesome stock research $ bah $ kors $ rrc $ goog try this URL"" Similar to tweet 14, it's an informational tweet providing info about Google but not directly stating a decision or positive outlook. It might contribute to the overall positive sentiment by giving clearer market conditions.

Now, compiling all these factors:

- Positive tweets: 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.
- Neutral tweets: 4.
- Negative tweets: None provided.

The majority of the tweets are positive. The information provided about Google's services (tweets 1,3,6), tech companies, and market outlook (tweets 9,10,11,12,13,14,15) contribute to a generally positive sentiment. Each tweet reinforces investor confidence in Google's performance.

Therefore, the overall impact on the stock price is likely [Positive]."
2014-06-10,Positive,"Alright, let me tackle this problem step by step. So, I have these tweets about a company and I need to figure out if they're going to positively, neutrally, or negatively affect their stock price. Hmm, okay.

First, looking at the target stock symbol from the first tweet: goog. Got it. The other symbols like trv, mhfi, cma are different stocks, but since they're not provided, maybe I can focus on the main one, goog.

Now, each tweet is a separate event that might influence investors' sentiments towards goog. Let's go through them one by one.

The first tweet says Google is buying a satellite maker called skybox imaging and it's worth $500 million. Hmm, that sounds like a strategic move. I think when a company spends money on acquisitions, especially in defense or defense-related companies, it can attract attention, which might positively impact their stock price because they become more recognized. So this seems positive.

The second tweet mentions couple of stocks to watch, including trv and mhfi. I'm not sure about those, but perhaps these are undervalued or have good growth potential. The mention of visiting low stores in august could be a bit confusing—maybe it's a typo? Maybe ""stores"" is the right word instead. Still, if Google is looking ahead to see what's happening with certain sectors, that could affect investor confidence.

The third tweet talks about stock market reports and offers for kos, wpo, pbct, goog. Offers from investors can be positive because they attract buyers, which usually boosts stock price. Plus, Google is one of the top companies on the list, so this might encourage more interest in them overall.

Fourth tweet asks for more info on k, bre, petm, goog stock. That sounds like it could prompt some research, but unless that information leads to a favorable outcome, I'm not sure if it directly affects the price. Maybe, but uncertain.

Fifth tweet says Google is in legal discussions with law firms about gay-marriage, shunning other sides. This seems more political or policy oriented. Legal issues can be volatile and might influence investor sentiment based on how seen as controversial. But unless this ties into the company's business strategy or growth prospects, it might not have a significant impact.

Sixth tweet mentions hon's AT_USER 279 is smart thermostat, competing with Google's in August stores. Again, this seems like something that could affect consumer behavior and market demand for related products. If other businesses start selling similar gear, the competitive landscape changes, which can be positive or negative depending on how it affects customer perception.

Seventh tweet talks about Google buying satellite imaging stock for $500m, similar to tweet one. This seems like another acquisition, reinforcing the idea that Google is investing in expanding its services, which could lead to higher stock value and positive sentiment.

Eighth tweet repeats the same purchase from tweet one, just again by Google. It's redundant but reinforces the same information, so it probably doesn't add much new.

Putting this together: The first tweet is a strategic acquisition that positively influences goog. Third tweet encourages research on kos and others, which might lower some concerns but could still have an impact if seen as positive. The sixth tweet mentions competition in stores, which could be negative because more companies entering the market can drive prices up or down depending on how it's perceived. The fifth tweet is about a legal issue that might not directly relate to the company's core business.

So, overall, I think the overall sentiment is mixed but leans towards positive due to multiple strategic and competitive factors that could either support or backfire. But maybe the most significant factors are the acquisitions from the first and third tweets, which are clear positives."
2014-06-11,Positive,"Alright, let me tackle this query step by step. So, the user has given me a set of tweets and wants to determine their impact on a company's stock price using just three options: [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Each tweet lists some prices and URLs, which seems like information about a specific company. Let me go through each one.

1. The first tweet mentions $ ivz $ trv $ pnr $ goog give it a try URL. The keyword here is 'goog', so I think that's Google.
2. Next, the tweet talks about Dropbox acquiring MobileSpan to boost byod security. That also points towards Google because it's associated with their products and services.
3. This tweet mentions stock_tracker targeting Google Inc., which reinforces that it's Google.
4. Here, 'songza' is mentioned in a context related to Google. So again, Google seems to be the target.
5. The tweet lists multiple stocks but includes AFCBL at $12.50 and talks about a call option for Aug/Op. This might relate more to another company, maybe a different tech leader like Tesla or Tesla's shares. But given that 'goog' is in there, I'll lean towards Google.
6. The tweet mentions a put option on $495 $ goog, so again, Google seems relevant here.
7. This tweet talks about new earnings for NewL (which might be Newreliance) and their stock price increase by $1. That's definitely related to Google.
8. The tweet tries to share data with other stocks but ends with a focus on Google and its competitors. So again, Google is the target.
9. This tweet discusses the relationship between Yelp and Facebook and compares them. It doesn't mention Google directly, so maybe it's unrelated or not relevant enough for this analysis.
10. Similar to tweet 8, it mentions Google-related terms like 'c' for buy satellite firm skybox and includes $500m. So again, Google is the primary target.

Now that I've identified the target as Google in all tweets except number 9, which doesn't seem directly related, I need to analyze each tweet's sentiment regarding Google stock.

Looking at tweet 9: It mentions Yelp and Facebook, but no specific mention of Google or its stock. The context is about two tech companies, so this tweet might be less relevant for determining the impact on Google's stock price. 

Other tweets focus on Google's products (like Dropbox, StockTracker, etc.) and their stock performance. They either talk about increases in stock prices or mentions of new earnings. Many tweets include positive language, such as 'can google', 'would be a shrewd move', or mentions of gains like $500M.

There are no negative tweets here. All the relevant ones discuss Google's growth and its competitors, which is generally positive for a company. However, tweet 9 seems out of context without Google related content.

Considering the other tweets, they all positively highlight Google's current stock performance and any potential moves or strategies to benefit from it. Therefore, despite tweet 9 being less relevant, the overall sentiment can still be classified as [Positive]."
2014-06-12,Positive,"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to analyze a couple of tweets related to a company and determine if they're likely to positively affect the stock price, have no impact, or negatively impact it. I'll need to break down each tweet individually first.

Starting with the first tweet: ""google $ goog just bought a satellite company for $ 500 million URL"". Hmm, this seems like information about Google acquiring something. Acquisitions are usually significant events that can affect a company's valuation and stock price. Informed investors might be interested in how this affects their investment strategy, so the positive side is obvious here.

Now, looking at the second tweet: ""get the latest on $ trn $ cam $ fmc $ goog investing URL"". This seems to be about Google investing in technology or something related to their product, as there are mentions of ""cam"" and ""fmc."" Companies that invest money tend to show strong earnings reports. Investors often buy shares when a company is performing well, so this suggests positive sentiment.

Combining both tweets, the first one talks about an acquisition, which is generally good for stock price if it's a beneficial deal. The second tweet mentions investments in tech companies, indicating they're doing business, which could also boost confidence and investor interest. So overall, these tweets are both supportive of Google's future performance."
2014-06-13,Negative,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on stock prices.

First, I need to identify each tweet and extract the target stock symbol. Looking through the tweets, I see several mentions of ""goog"" in their URLs. The most prominent is ""goog l $ googl"", which seems to be referring to Google's stock. So, my target stock is Google (GOOGL).

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet talks about apple investing in mobile medical apps. That doesn't directly mention Google, so maybe this tweet isn't relevant for GOOG. But it says ""apple's venture into mobile medical applications : a game changer?"" It seems like a positive statement about the company but without specific info on GOOGL.

2. The second tweet is also about Apple, not Google. It mentions the daily show and glass half empty, which is more about tech trends. Again, no direct link to GOOG.

3. Third tweet uses $ mu and ""myl"", which are unclear terms. It says to click a URL related to investing in Google. This seems relevant because it's directly talking about Google stock. So this is definitely positive because the user is suggesting investment.

4. Fourth tweet suggests that Google might be overvalued by comparing it to other stocks like Rayo (CAM) or Waymo (GOOVB). This could indicate either a possible sell-off or concern, so maybe neutral or negative.

5. Fifth tweet mentions Google launching a health-tracking platform called ""goog fit"". Since this is an investment recommendation related to Google's stock, this is positive because it suggests the stock is undervalued.

6. Sixth tweet talks about oversold in the Stochastic channel and a bullish engulfing pattern for Apple (AOL), Tesla (TSLA), Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), and others including GOOGL. This is a bearish indicator for all those stocks, which could lead to negative sentiment.

7. Seventh tweet mentions Google's business app aims to streamline online info management. It might be a positive note about the company, but not directly mentioning GOOG.

8. Eighth tweet repeats point 6 with the same bearish indicators, reinforcing the idea that GOOGL is oversold and undervalued.

9. Ninth tweet suggests stocks like SIRI (STOR) could be worth buying for financials. This doesn't specifically mention GOOGL, so maybe this isn't relevant unless there's a connection I'm missing.

10. Tenth tweet discusses investing in companies like ESRX, NU, and GOOG's financials. Again, the focus is on GOOG, so positive because it's an investment recommendation.

11. Eleventh tweet repeats point 6 with oversold indicators. This could mean that investors are watching Google again, leading to potential positive sentiment.

12. Twelfth tweet mentions researching Google's financials. While this isn't a tweet about investing in GOOG itself, it might suggest an interest or analysis related to the company, which could be neutral or positive if there's any specific information about GOOGL.

13. Thirteenth tweet talks about Google spending money on satellites for internet access. This is a direct investment recommendation pointing towards Google stock, so this is definitely positive because it suggests potential buying.

Now, compiling all these thoughts: The main positive tweets are the third (clicking investment), fifth, eleventh, and thirteenth (spending on satellites). However, some tweets like point 6 mention multiple stocks which could lead to a bearish overall market but with specific focus on GOOG. Other positive points include point 10 about ESRX, NU, and Google's financials.

There are also negative points in points 6,7,8,9,12,13 that indicate oversold conditions for multiple stocks, including GOOGL.

So overall, there is a mix of positive tweets suggesting potential investments or positive sentiment on certain aspects (like spending) but conflicting bearish signals from other tweets. The main factors are about Google's financials and investment recommendations which could go either way, with uncertainty from the broader market conditions indicated by multiple oversold indicators.

Considering all this, it seems like there's a mix of mixed signals. Some tweets suggest positive things, others negative."
2014-06-14,Positive,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for a given company. The user has provided 17 tweets, so I need to go through each one step by step.

First, I think I should identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. It seems like most of them mention $ goog or other tech stocks. Looking at tweet 2 and 6, they both talk about $ goog. So I'll focus on those since others might be referencing different companies but seem less relevant to the main topic.

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate the factors into positive and negative ones. For example, in tweet 1, it mentions being ""funny"" from a show, which is probably positive. It also talks about glass half empty and googleglass, which might be unrelated but could suggest a humorous comment.

Tweets like 3 and 7 seem to mention 7.51% average gain in a month, so that's a clear positive factor. Similarly, tweet 4 suggests investing in tech stocks because of a YouTube video showing expertise help open something.

I should assess each tweet's sentiment. If a tweet has multiple factors, I'll note both positive and negative aspects. Then, for each relevant tweet, I can determine if it adds to the overall expectation of the stock moving up or down. 

Looking at tweet 2, it provides information on specific stocks but doesn't directly mention a trend. It might indicate more research or analysis which could be good.

Tweets 6 and 10 talk about trends in stock prices or financial news, which are positive signals. They're suggesting to watch certain stocks based on money rate limits, which is a bit off-topic for a tech company but still relevant if the user is monitoring the market.

Then there are tweets that mention specific stocks like $ scty, $ adm, etc., which could indicate investor sentiment or news about those companies. But without specifics, it's hard to know the impact.

Putting this all together, the positive tweets suggest increasing confidence in tech stocks, while negative ones might show concern or lack information. However, some tweets are speculative and not directly linked to the stock price. 

Overall, if I consider that there are multiple factors pointing towards an increase (like positive trends from investing), it leans toward a positive sentiment. But there's also uncertainty about other stocks, which could be a bit mixed. But leaning more towards a general positive trend based on some specific mentions.

So, after evaluating all the tweets, I think the overall sentiment is likely positive because of the positive factors and some speculative but relevant information."
2014-06-15,Neutral,"Okay, I need to figure out the likely impact on the stock price based on these tweets. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

First, the user mentioned ""google has better maps of world cup venues than OpenStreetMap."" That sounds like a positive statement because it's talking about something useful for their work or business. So that's a positive factor.

Next, ""subscribers saw our penny stock picks gain over 4,000% this year!"" This is also positive because it indicates that the stock has seen significant gains, which usually boosts investor interest and sentiment. That's another positive.

Then there's "" insider trading updates on $efx $xel $i $goog economy URL."" Insideiders talking about something in the economy could be either good or bad news. If they're planning to buy a company, it might affect their stock price negatively, but if it's speculative or unrelated, maybe not. I'm leaning towards that they think this is positive because it could drive down prices for others.

Lastly, ""rt AT_USER beyond balloons ! ‘ AT_USER google agrees to buy satellite company skybox imaging for $500 million . $ goog URL."" This seems like a positive action from a user, so it's good news. More buying can increase investor interest and might boost the stock price positively.

Now, combining all these factors: two positives about gains, one potentially negative due to insider trading, but another positive action from a user. It seems overall there's some uncertainty or mixed sentiment. Maybe not enough information is given to determine it completely. So I think the overall impact isn't clear-cut."
2014-06-16,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. So, I need to analyze some tweets about a company's stock and determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative for their impact on the stock price.

First, looking at the target stock symbol provided: $ tup buying or selling ? $ lng $ wat $ goog equity URL. Hmm, that seems a bit unclear. Maybe it's related to a specific company? I should check the context or maybe see if there's a typo in the symbols. It uses 'tup' and 'wat', which don't ring a bell for common stock symbols.

But wait, the user included some tweets:
1. $ tup buying or selling ? $ lng $ wat $ goog equity URL

I think the target stock symbol might be 'goog', given the 'goog' at the end of the tweet. That would make sense because Google is a well-known company with significant influence in the tech and financial markets.

So, assuming the target is 'GOOGL', let's proceed.

Now, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. Let me parse the first tweet: "" $ tup buying or selling ? $ lng $ wat $ goog equity URL""

I notice some symbols that might be abbreviations. '$ tup' could stand for something like 'Buy Up' or 'Tup' (a common short form). Then, it's looking to buy or sell. The next part is asking about Google equity URL.

Hmm, not sure what ' lng $ wat $ goog' means. Maybe it's a typo or additional information. I'll focus on the main message: someone is considering buying or selling Google stock based on some other factors indicated by the symbols and query string.

I think the tweet is trying to assess investor sentiment or provide guidance for trading. If the person believes in 'goog', they might be looking at potential growth opportunities or risks, affecting the overall market and their stock's value.

Considering that, I'm leaning towards a positive outlook because the user seems interested in investing based on Google's performance. Therefore, this tweet is likely to have a positive impact."
2014-06-17,Missing,File not found
2014-06-18,Negative,"Alright, so I need to determine whether these tweets will impact the stock price positively, neutrally, or negatively. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at each tweet and trying to extract the target stock symbol. The first tweet mentions ""pgti,"" but that doesn't immediately ring a bell as a known company symbol. I'll check if pgti is related to any companies. After some quick research, I don't see an immediate connection, so maybe it's a typo or something not widely recognized.

The second tweet talks about $ nxtd. I recall that ""nxtd"" stands for NextThought Technologies, which is a well-known technology company. The words like smart, technology, and advancement in development suggest this could be a large, established player in the sector. Their stock symbol being ""nxt"" is something I remember from discussions on tech trends.

The third tweet says ""$ goog still a turd wow - tr4gedy URL"". It starts with $ goog, which as we've noted, is Google, the world's second-largest technology company by revenue and assets. The phrase ""still a turd"" might be a metaphorical way of expressing frustration or negative mood, possibly due to recent events. However, there's an exclamation mark at the end, so it seems like the author is really upset.

Now, evaluating each tweet for factors. For the second tweet, nxtd is clearly a tech company. The mention of smart and technology suggests high growth potential in that sector. The positive news about their advancements would likely increase investor confidence, leading to a positive impact on the stock price.

The third tweet mentions Google but doesn't provide specific information. It's part of a meta-comment about frustration and negative mood, which might affect sentiment towards the company. However, it's not an explicit mention of any positive or negative factors related to the company itself. The exclamation mark might indicate strong emotions that could sway investor sentiment in either direction.

The first tweet is unclear since it refers to pgti without providing a stock symbol. This uncertainty could lead to incomplete information, which might make the analysis challenging. But based on the other tweets mentioning nxtd and Google, I can infer some positive signs, especially from their direct mentions.

Considering all factors—positive mentions of companies and less explicit negative comments—it seems like the overall sentiment is mixed but leans towards positive since one key player is a leader in the tech sector with a clear focus area. However, the mix of emotions might make it uncertain. But perhaps the positive factors outweigh the negatives here."
2014-06-19,Positive,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of Google. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

Starting with tweet 1 and 2: They both mention AT_USER buying lots of shares in Aapl right now. That seems like a strong positive sign. The user is investing heavily, which usually indicates optimism about the company's growth potential.

Tweets 3-6 are repeating the same message as tweets 1-2. They're showing that AT_USER is focused on big tech companies and spending more on mobile ads. This kind of direct support for Aapl is a classic example of positive sentiment because investors who believe in a strong growth outlook buy up shares.

Tweets 7: This tweet highlights how mobile video ads are driving growth in the US ad spending. It connects video ads with broader advertising efforts, which suggests a strategic focus on marketing and customer acquisition. High spending on such efforts can boost a company's valuation.

Tweets 8-10 talk about using $ fb and $ twtr to check stock picks later and considering buying $ goog. This seems like an opportunity or at least a reassurance that the user is tracking their stocks. Investors looking for opportunities might see this as positive, but it could also imply that they're cautious.

Tweets 11 mentions piper jaffray discussing a phone app problem but giving a positive outlook with a good start. This shows leadership in a tough market and confidence in the company's future, which is another positive sign.

Tweets 12 refers to $ vfc as a potential stock pick for Aapl. A rise in stock picks from users usually indicates investor interest or expectation of strong performance, contributing to positive sentiment.

Tweets 13 talks about $ vfc breaking into another sector. If there's a competitive move to gain market share, it could drive up prices and support the overall growth of Aapl.

Lastly, tweet 14 mentions patent info for speech synthesis devices. The legal document is likely about innovation or progress in their technology, which can attract investors interested in research and development.

Considering all these factors—positive investments, strategic marketing efforts, a focus on tech, and potential market reactions—the overall sentiment seems positive. However, it's important to note that without more context like volume or specific technical indicators, the impact might not be immediately clear. But based solely on this information, I'd lean towards a Positive sentiment."
2014-06-20,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a given company. The user provided several tweets, and I need to figure out if they're positive, neutral, or negative for the stock's future price.

First, let me break down each tweet to understand their content and sentiment.

1. The first tweet is about $ goog (Google). It says the CEO isn't afraid of Google and points to Amazon's URL. This seems like a positive statement because it expresses confidence in Google. So, I'll mark this as Positive.

2. The second tweet mentions that after an EU ruling, Canadian judges will remove links worldwide related to Google. Since it's about regulations affecting Google services, the impact on investor sentiment could be neutral or negative if there are concerns about data privacy and surveillance. But since it's a specific rule change, maybe it's not so obvious. I'll consider this as Neutral.

3. The third tweet lists several stocks like LSI, QCOM, DLPH, and GOOG for ""should you?"" which could influence investor opinions on Google. It might encourage holding or considering Google stock, leading to a Positive sentiment if it's seen as a good investment option.

4. This tweet talks about Google's ""madewithcode"" program encouraging more girls in coding. This is a positive statement highlighting achievements and initiatives in the tech industry. I'll mark this as Positive.

5. The fourth tweet refers to 91% of Google and LinkedIn employees being white or Asian, affecting the tech workforce. While this is about diversity, it's more about industry demographics rather than directly impacting Google's performance. So, maybe a slight Neutral sentiment here.

6. Another link to video ads from a tech startup on Google. It could create buzz, which might lead some investors to buy shares, so I'll mark this as Positive because of potential positive reactions.

7. Similar to tweet 5, it talks about white or Asian employees but again focuses on industry demographics, not directly on Google's performance. So, maybe Neutral here.

8. This tweet mentions Microsoft's Bing in the search industry and raises a question. It might influence investor confidence. If there's uncertainty, that could be Negative if it affects their expectations.

9. The last tweet talks about Google seeking to take aim at its own revenues. Since this is about financial performance, it directly impacts investors' perceptions of how well the stock will do. A positive statement here should lead to a Positive overall sentiment."
2014-06-21,Negative,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether these tweets are positive, negative, or neutral in terms of their impact on the stock price for a given company. Let me start by looking at each tweet one by one.

The first tweet says: ""are you bearish on these stocks $ mco $ bmrn $ r $ goog moneymanagement URL."" The word ""bearish"" here suggests that the author is indicating negative sentiment towards the stocks, which might be referring to a particular stock or company. I know that ""mco"" could stand for something like Microsoft, but without more context, it's hard to tell exactly which one. Similarly, ""bmrn"" and ""r"" don't ring any bells on their own.

The second tweet is: ""dennyt : soda company info $ soda $ tedu $ dba $ abx $ goog URL."" Again, ""bearish"" here might be about another stock or maybe indicating a broader negative outlook. The mention of ""soda company info"" doesn't give much clarity either. It's unclear which companies these abbreviations stand for.

Since the tweets don't provide enough information to identify specific stocks or their performance, I can't determine the impact on any particular stock's price. Therefore, without knowing which company is referred to by these symbols, it's impossible to assess the sentiment positively, neutrally, or negatively."
2014-06-22,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this analysis for the given tweets about Google's stock price. So, the user has provided three tweets and wants me to determine if they are positive, neutral, or negative in impact on the stock.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER 91 % of google and linkedin employees are white or asian . the tech workforce : URL $ lnkd $ goog URL"". It doesn't specify a particular company unless it's implied, which in this case is Google since it's the subject. So I can assume the target stock is Google.

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate the factors into positive and negative. Let me look at each one by one.

The first tweet mentions that 91% of Google employees are white or Asian. I think that reflects a gender and ethnic diversity in the tech workforce. That could positively influence investor sentiment because it shows diversity and inclusion, which is often seen as a good trait for a company. So this might be a positive factor.

The second tweet talks about Google chairman believing Tel Aviv (which is Israel) is the next silicon valley leader. Tel Aviv is known for its tech industry, especially since Facebook and Microsoft are based there. This seems like an important announcement by Google's chairman, which could positively influence investor expectations by signaling strategic importance or potential success in the company. So this would be a positive factor as well.

The third tweet mentions that Facebook is improving their publicitaire (ad) campaign assets with $5 billion across $3 companies: Facebook, Microsoft, and Google. This shows progress in a specific area related to advertising, which could positively impact investor confidence. It might encourage more investments in ad-related technologies or services, contributing to the overall stock performance.

Now, assessing sentiment for each tweet. The first one is clearly positive because it's about diversity in the workforce. The second is also positive since Google is making a strategic announcement. The third tweet seems promising as well, indicating ongoing progress and confidence in their efforts.

Since all three tweets are reinforcing positive aspects related to Google's future prospects—diversity, strategy, and growth—the overall sentiment should be positive."
2014-06-23,Positive,"Alright, let me analyze these tweets to determine their impact on TSLA's stock price. I'll go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol, it seems like the stock is TSLA (TikTok), not TSLA. The tweets are all about Apple's venture into mobile medical applications, specifically a game-changing move. Each tweet mentions Google as a big player in this space and refers to their performance metrics.

Looking at each tweet, I see multiple mentions of Google, Apple's product introducing a game-changing feature, and Google's stock price movements. For instance, in the first few tweets, Google's stock (GOOGL) goes up by 1.16%, then drops slightly after an update, but it remains positive overall. The sentiment seems consistent across all these tweets.

The user mentions ""game changer"" each time Apple introduces a new feature that was previously unclear or limited, which is generally positive for the company. Google's stock price movements are often in line with Apple's success in this area—Google has been following Apple closely and their performance supports Apple's initiatives, especially since some of Apple's products have had significant impacts on Google.

Since all tweets reinforce a positive outlook from both Apple and Google about each other's progress, the overall sentiment is positive. There are no negative comments or concerns here. It seems like TSLA benefits from this collaboration that accelerates innovation, which is generally seen as a good thing in the stock market."
2014-06-24,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. The user provided 22 tweets, and each seems to be talking about Google or related companies like Apple, Facebook, etc., discussing trends in the market.

First, looking at tweet 1, it says a user bought shares in several stocks, which probably means they're positive about trading volume or investor interest.

Tweets 2-7 also mention buying shares of Google, Apple, and others. This seems to be selling rather than buying, which could indicate negative sentiment because people are leaving to support the same company.

_tweets 8-13 continue to talk about Google's revenue growth from their Play app, mentioning games and freemium apps. Positive trends can boost investor confidence.

Tweets 14-20 focus on Google acquiring companies like Oracle or YHOO. Acquisitions often signal good news for the stock, so these could be positive.

Tweets 21 is a mix of followings and opinions about stocks. It doesn't have strong positive or negative words but mixed reviews.

Tweets 22 seems neutral as it's just repeating previous statements without any new information.

Overall, I notice a mix: some tweets are selling shares (negative), others are buying them (positive). There's a lot of talk about Google's revenue and strategic acquisitions. But some tweets don't provide substantial information to sway the sentiment much.

In my opinion, while there is positive talk about Google's future in app services and big companies, the majority of the tweets are selling rather than buying. The overall market seems to be in a range, so it's tough to say for sure, but considering the trend towards growth and potential acquisitions, maybe it leans positive."
2014-06-25,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of Google. Let's start by identifying each tweet and breaking them down into factors.

1. The first tweet mentions that Google is ""dem smart watches tho URL."" That seems like a positive sentiment since it's talking about their product being successful.
2. The second tweet talks about a smartwatch war, which I know happened between Google and Apple's Apple Watch, so this is definitely positive for Google.
3. The third tweet says Google doesn't have a business model. This could be seen as negative because it might suggest financial strain or potential risks to investors.
4. The fourth tweet mentions that 3 hours later, Google's I/O keynote event ended. While this is an update on a past event, it's more of an update than sentiment about the stock price.
5. The fifth tweet discusses Google shares going up by almost 2%. This shows strong positive news about their performance, so definitely positive.
6. Several tweets from Google, Microsoft, and others are delving into cloud storage for businesses. While this is related to tech topics, it doesn't directly impact the stock price of a company unless there's an expected revenue or profit increase, which isn't clear here.
7. A tweet mentions that AT_USER bought 6 million shares in several companies including Google. This could imply a strategic move to acquire growth opportunities, which might be positive but depends on context and timing.
8. Another tweet talks about Google collaboration with Mr. Bill Gates for VR headsets. While this is relevant to tech innovation, it doesn't specify financial performance or stock updates that would affect the price.
9. A tweet discusses Google's liquidity increasing after breaking out of a descending channel. This might indicate improved financial health, which could positively impact stock prices.
10. The tenth tweet mentions discussing GoogleIO with an AT_USER from Google. While this is a professional interaction, it doesn't provide any new information about the company's performance or market position.
11. The eleventh tweet talks about an Nvidia tegra 4 processor being used in devices powered by Google. This could be relevant to future hardware advancements but isn't directly tied to stock price changes.
12. Similar to tweet 11, another tweet mentions Google breaking out of a descending channel, which might suggest good news for investor confidence and thus positive sentiment.
13. The twelfth tweet discusses a study showing ISPS have room for improvement. This is about the company's internal processes, which isn't directly linked to market performance but could affect their operational efficiency.
14. The thirteenth tweet offers a free trial sign-up link. This is a marketing strategy rather than affecting stock price.

Now, summarizing each tweet:
- Positive tweets: 1, 2, 5, 9, 12
- Neutral: None
- Negative: 3, 7

The overall sentiment is mixed but leans towards positive because there are several positive tweets indicating good news about the company's products and strategic moves. However, some negative factors like a business model issue and cloud storage discussions might suggest potential risks or inefficiencies that need to be monitored."
2014-06-26,Positive,"Okay, let's try to figure out how to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of Google. I'm not super familiar with all the details, but I'll go step by step.

First, looking at each tweet one by one and trying to identify positive or negative factors. Each tweet talks about different topics related to Google's products and projects. 

1. The first tweet mentions that Apple is looking into a smart home system and there's something under scrutiny. So, this could be a good time for Apple to announce something. Maybe Google sees this as a chance? I'm not sure yet.

2. The second tweet says Google announces Android TV. Android is a major operating system for smartphones. If Google makes Android TV more popular or if it's a significant product line, that might boost their revenue. That could be positive.

3. The third tweet asks if Google just squashed one of the iPhone's biggest selling points. Squashing something might mean Google loses market share, which would definitely hurt them. So that seems like a negative factor.

4. The fourth tweet mentions a patent for defining interaction proneness based on how people interact with each other. Interaction proneness is about how easy it is to talk or move without losing your position. If Google gets this patent, it could allow more features in their products, which is good because that would likely improve stock price.

5. The fifth tweet talks about Google Glass not being the only futuristic project and lists four others. While there are other projects, I'm not sure if they're all beneficial or harmful. It's a bit ambiguous but might have some positive aspects.

6. The sixth tweet mentions liquid holdings in Niche Colas and Convergex. Liquid assets can be sold easily, which usually makes them attractive to investors because it increases liquidity and can drive up stock prices. That sounds like a positive factor.

7. The seventh tweet says Barclays initiated internet names with positive ratings but are most concerned about NFLX. Positive ratings could boost investor sentiment, while negative concerns might decrease it. It's tricky, but there's an imbalance here which makes the overall impact uncertain.

8. The eighth tweet is a URL asking Google to release a consumer version of their 3D tablet. This sounds like a major project or at least a significant action from Google. If they announce this, especially if it's something impressive, that could be a strong positive factor.

9. The ninth tweet again refers to liquid holdings in Niche Colas and Convergex, similar to tweet number six. So another chance for increasing liquidity, which is positive.

Now, putting it all together. There are both positive and negative tweets here. Some tweets like the third one (- because squashing a big market share) seems to be the main points. The eighth tweet could add more positivity. The other tweets might have varied effects but some are conflicting or ambiguous. So overall, there's a mix of mixed signals—some good news, some bad, and some unsure. It's hard to say if it leans positive, neutral, or negative overall because there are conflicting thoughts.

But looking at all the positive points (tweets 2,4,8) and how liquid holdings can be good for stock price, but with Twitter being a social platform where opinions mix, maybe some people see positives and others negatives. Since I have to choose one of [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative], I need to decide which side is more prevalent.

Considering the tweets, while there are definitely positive elements like Android TV, smart home systems, 3D tablets, etc., the tweet about squashing an iPhone's selling point and the concern about NFLX might pull the negative influence. However, Twitter's sentiment can be split, so it's a bit tricky. But I think the positive tweets are still enough to make me lean towards [Positive], especially if the overall trend is more in line with tech-related companies."
2014-06-27,Neutral,"Alright, let me tackle this query step by step. I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on a company's stock price. The user has provided a set of tweets and an output requirement where I have to decide if each tweet is positive, neutral, or negative.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""stock market reports on stocks like $ cbt $ tel $ exr $ goog must see URL"". Hmm, this seems more like an announcement than a tweet. Maybe it's a link or something else, but I'm not sure. It could be positive if they're providing relevant information about the stock.

Next is ""rt AT_USER $ liqd nicholas colas on AT_USER liquid holdings and convergex URL $ aapl $ fb $ gpro $ mine $ twtr $ goog URL"". This looks like an RT message with some keywords like ""liquid"" and ""colas."" I think this could be positive because it's related to liquid stock holdings, which might indicate good news or confidence.

The third tweet: ""$ lm stocks you might want to sell $ wag $ key $ goog nasdaq URL"". Selling stocks is a negative action; selling indicates concern about the stock price.

Then there are several tweets mentioning research on specific companies like $ anf $ ko $ goog and others. These seem like positive research messages that can positively impact investor sentiment.

Looking further, some tweets talk about online advertising battles with companies like $ gpro or $ msft. This could be neutral if they're not providing good news or bad info but might still influence stock price moderately.

One tweet mentions ""best research on stocks such s $ gs $ alle $ aap $ goog goto URL."" This is a positive action for research, which can help in understanding the company's position and future performance.

Finally, another tweet says ""gpro all the traders here at gpro . reaching 30m . $ fb $ twtr $ aapl $ goog boring today ."" It sounds like a complaint about trading activity, maybe negative if it's discouraging investors or showing disappointment.

Now, summarizing each tweet: The first is ambiguous but could be positive. The second seems positive. The third is definitely negative. The fourth to seventh are mixed—some positive, some neutral. The eighth is unclear without context. The ninth is also uncertain but might be negative due to the frustration mentioned.

Overall, there's a mix of positives and negatives in these tweets. Some indicate good news, others show concerns or no direct impact. It seems like they're providing various insights that could help investors evaluate the stock, so the sentiment should reflect both positive and neutral aspects."
2014-06-28,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for the given company.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Let's look at each one:

1. The first tweet mentions ""dks small-cap stocks making 52 - wk highs kmt gtrw goog equity URL."" So, I think the stock symbol here is ""gtrw"" because it's part of the address.
   
2. The second tweet says ""$ odfl $ tw $ mnst $ goog stock URL."" Here, it seems to be about ""goog stock,"" so the symbol is ""goog"".

3. The third tweet starts with ""investing in tech | google : troubles ahead ? goog googl URL."" It mentions ""google"" multiple times and uses ""goog"" again at the end of the address.

4. The fourth tweet talks about ""$ mbi $ gww $ hcc $ goog investing URL."" Again, it's about ""goog.""

5. The fifth tweet says ""$ trw looking for the next $ vr $ egn $ goog financialnews URL."" It mentions ""trw,"" which I believe stands for trading volume.

So, compiling all these, the target stock symbols seem to be dks (small-cap), goog, odfl, mnst, gww, hcc, mbi, vr, and trw. Wait, but some of these might not be standard stock symbols. Maybe they are abbreviations or specific terms in the context of the company's finance.

Next, I need to analyze each tweet to identify positive (Positive) and negative (Negative) factors for the target stock. Let me go through them one by one:

1. The first tweet says small-cap stocks are making 52-week highs. That sounds positive because it could indicate growth potential or favorable economic conditions.

2. The second tweet mentions goog stock, which is a well-known company. This seems like a direct mention of the stock, so likely positive.

3. The third tweet talks about ""trouble ahead"" and mentions google, but doesn't provide specific details about positive or negative factors. It's ambiguous. So, maybe it's neutral or uncertain.

4. The fourth tweet is similar to the second one—it just mentions goog investing. Without specifics, it's hard to tell if it's positive or negative.

5. The fifth tweet suggests ""trading volume"" and mentions goog financial news. Trading volume can indicate market interest but doesn't directly state whether the stock is rising or falling.

Now, for each tweet:

1. Positive factor: 52-week highs for small-cap stocks.
   Negative factor: No mention of anything negative here.

2. Positive factor: goog stock.
   Negative factor: None.

3. Neutral: Ambiguous information about trends and trading volume.

4. Neutral: Similar to tweet 2; no positive or negative info.

5. Neutral: Trading volume and financial news, which are indicators but not specific sentiment.

Combining all these observations, I can see that some tweets are positive regarding the stock's performance (trend, goog being mentioned), others are neutral about trends but provide information on volume. The overall sentiment is a mix of positive mentions related to goog and potential concerns about small-cap stocks.

However, since some tweets provide more specific information than others, it might be challenging to assign a definite overall sentiment. But the majority of the positive factors seem to suggest that goog could perform well in the near term. The other tweets indicate that trading volume is high and the stock is being actively monitored for financial news, which adds some uncertainty.

So, considering all the information, I think there's an element of uncertainty due to small-cap stocks historically having lower volatility but this tweet suggests they might be on the rise. Therefore, it leans towards a neutral overall sentiment."
2014-06-29,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of the given company. The user has provided five tweets and wants me to decide if each is positive, neutral, or negative in terms of their likely effect on the stock price.

First, I'll start by identifying the target stock from the tweets. Looking through the tweets, I don't see any specific stock symbols mentioned, but perhaps they're referring to a general company, maybe something like Google since it's included multiple times with ""goog"" and related words. Let me check each tweet again:

1. The first tweet mentions $ cnca $ swy $ hcp $ goog singedinvestor URL. Not sure about these codes.
2. Second tweet has $ pnc $ bmy $ stx $ goog click URL. Again, not clear on the stocks involved.
3. Third tweet is about a stock watchlist and mentions ""dont be left behind"" with ""mmm $ fis $ wyn $ goog goto URL."" This might refer to Google since it's included here multiple times.
4. Fourth tweet talks about ""rt AT_USER saturday links : an indexing bloat and the rise of microgrids URL via AT_USER $ goog $ spy $ tlt."" So this could be Google or another tech-related company through their accounts on social media or Twitter (AT_USER).
5. Fifth tweet mentions research on $ vrtx $ dell $ ftnt $ goog equity. Again, Google is involved.

Since the majority of tweets mention Google or related terms like ""goog,"" I think the target stock is likely Google (GOOG) or a company closely related to it.

Now, let's analyze each tweet in detail:

1. The first tweet: ""did you lose money on $ cnca $ swy $ hcp $ goog singedinvestor URL"" - Hmm, this seems like a generic comment about losing money without specific context. It might not directly relate to Google but could be about any stock.

2. Second tweet: ""this weeks stocks you should watch $ pnc $ bmy $ stx $ goog click URL."" This could mean the user is suggesting that investing in those companies this week would be a good idea, which could lead to an increase in their stock prices if they do the research and follow through.

3. Third tweet: ""stock watchlist . dont be left behind $ mmm $ fis $ wyn $ goog goto URL"" - This looks like a direct invitation for investors to join Google's watchlist. If this tweet is seen as promoting Google, it might encourage others to buy their stock, which could lead to an increase.

4. Fourth tweet: ""rt AT_USER saturday links : an indexing bloat and the rise of microgrids URL via AT_USER $ goog $ spy $ tlt"" - The mention of AT_USER (Twitter) suggests this is a Twitter feed or profile. If it's promoting Google through their accounts, particularly through links related to their stock and other tech companies like spy or tlt, this could attract investors, increasing the stock price.

5. Fifth tweet: ""get research on $ vrtx $ dell $ ftnt $ goog equity"" - Again, Google is in here with ""goog."" This might be encouraging someone to conduct their own research, which if done correctly, can positively impact the stock price by showing value and growth potential.

Putting it all together:

- The first tweet seems like a general observation without specific direction.
- The second tweet suggests the user believes they should watch certain stocks but doesn't mention any positive or negative actions.
- The third tweet directly promotes Google's stock as part of a watchlist, which is likely to attract investors and increase the price.
- The fourth tweet uses social media links to promote Google's stock, encouraging others to engage and buy it.
- The fifth tweet again mentions Google, prompting someone to do their own research, which can be seen as positive action.

The third tweet clearly promotes Google by suggesting an investment strategy and joining a watchlist. The fourth tweet uses social media to attract attention, encouraging engagement. The fifth tweet also does the same but through different links. The second tweet is more of a recommendation rather than directly influencing stock price. 

Considering all these, it seems like the overall sentiment towards Google's stock would be positive because multiple tweets are promoting and encouraging investors by either joining lists or inviting investment recommendations."
2014-06-30,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about a company's stock and determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative. 

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Let me go through them one by one.

1. ""great stock newsletter you must have $ jbl $ hma $ wdr $ goog click URL"" – Hmm, this is a newsletter with multiple company names: JBL, HMA, WDR, and GOOG. So the target stock could be GOOG (Google). But wait, there are other companies mentioned too, so I might need to check if there's a clear winner.

2. ""rt AT_USER $ aapl $ goog $ pcln $ nflx $ fb options day_traed من ي ..."" – A lot of company names: APPL (Apple), GOOG, PCLN (Palm Co.), NFLX (Future), FB (Facebook). This seems like a mix of stocks. I'm not sure what the target is here.

3. ""$ bdn get more info on $ pf $ azo $ goog singelinvestor URL"" – Target could be GOOG again? But there are other companies: PFS, AZO, Singlinvestor. Maybe it's about Google? Not entirely clear yet.

4. ""$ krc todays stocks you should watch $ slgn $ voya $ goog financial URL"" – Target is GOOG, with others like SLCN and VOA. I'm not sure which one the user is targeting here.

5. ""rt AT_USER google's secretive updates leave sites scrambling : URL ( via AT_USER $ goog"" – This mentions Google's news or developments that are causing problems on other websites. It seems like a negative tip because of potential issues, but it’s vague and hard to determine sentiment.

6. ""$ stocks you might want to hold onto $ kim $ ce $ rga $ goog stock URL"" – Target is GOOG with others like KIM, CE, RGA. Still unclear which company the user is referring to.

7. ""$ kbr todays movers to research $ foxa $ rop $ goog i suggest URL"" – Target probably is GOOG again, but other companies are mentioned: FOXA and ROPE. Maybe it's about Google?

8. ""$ stocks you might want to sell $ gmt $ are $ goog $ yod economy URL"" – Target is GOOG, others like GMT and ECONOMY. Still unclear.

9. ""google ' c ' : rochester optical announces new fashion sun lenses for google glass available ... $ goog URL via AT_USER"" – A specific news about Google products. It sounds positive because Google is promoting something that might attract investors. The target seems to be GOOG.

10. ""this weeks stocks you should watch $ emc $ sjm $ p $ goog newsletter URL"" – Target is GOOG, with other companies like EMC and SJM. Still not clear on the specific company.

11. ""rt AT_USER google to spend upwards of $ 1 billion for satellites to extend internet access $ goog URL"" – Clearly mentions Google spending money on something related to their services, which could be positive for investors. Target is GOOG.

12. ""$ regn stocks you might want to sell $ ilmn $ rga $ goog stockmarket URL"" – Target is GOOG and others like ILMN and RGA. Still unclear.

13. ""did you lose money on $ hon $ gt $ itt $ goog overvalued URL"" – This seems to suggest that the user has invested in GOOG but found its stock undervalued, which would be a negative sentiment as investors are concerned about price. Target is GOOG.

14. ""$ goog - has the fall of samsung begun ? -> URL stock stocks stockaction"" – The phrase ""has the fall of samsung begun?"" indicates that the user is monitoring GOOG and expects to see some impact. It's speculative but could be positive as they're looking for potential changes in the company. Target is likely GOOG.

15. ""considering investing in $ vno $ mck $ xec $ goog give it a try URL"" – Target is GOOG, with others like VNO and MCK. Still not clear on the specific company.

16. ""$ cbg are you looking for winners like $ reg $ xrx $ goog i suggest URL"" – Target is GOOG again. Others mentioned include REG and XRX, but not sure which company this pertains to.

17. ""get free research on $ adt $ endp $ pdm $ goog research URL"" – Target is GOOG, with other companies like ADT, ENDP, PDM. Not clear on the specific target here.

Now, compiling all these, I can see that the user is focusing mainly on GOOG and some related companies. However, there are multiple tweets about different aspects of Google's performance or news. Some are positive, others are speculative or negative based on information. For example, tweet 9 is clear about Google investing money, which could be seen as a positive tip if investors expect growth. Similarly, tweets like 14 mention that the fall in Samsung might have an impact on GOOG.

But since there's some uncertainty and speculation about specific companies (like ILMN or REG), it's hard to assign a definite sentiment. The user is likely trying to gain insights into Google's performance but without knowing exactly which stock they're targeting, it's challenging to gauge the overall sentiment as clearly positive or negative."
2014-07-01,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided a list of 20 tweets about different stocks and their sentiments towards them. My task is to figure out if each tweet is positive, neutral, or negative in terms of sentiment.

First, I should identify the target stock for each tweet because that will help me assess whether the content relates to a specific company. Let's go through each tweet one by one.

1. ""instagram is facebook's ticket to china's advertising market $ fb $ goog $ googl URL"" – Hmm, ""china's advertising market"" could refer to a different company, maybe a media or marketing firm. The mention of Instagram and Facebook suggests it's related to the tech industry, so probably referring to a different company.

2. ""get free research on $ emr $ els $ var $ goog check out URL"" – ""emr"" is an acronym for energy markets, ""els"" might be another market segment, and ""var"" could be volatility. The mention of Google suggests it's about tech or stock analysis related to that company.

3. ""rt AT_USER barron's rated apple as america's most respected company - i beg to differ URL $ goog google $ googl $ s …"" – ""Barron's"" is a financial service firm, but the tweet seems more critical of Google and Apple, suggesting negative sentiment towards both companies.

4. ""best pennystock research $ goog $ p $ nbl $ epzm money URL"" – This clearly mentions Google as the stock being researched for pennystock (which refers to small-cap stocks), so it's directly about Google.

5. ""are you thinking of investing in $ chtr $ incy $ lm $ goog stock URL"" – ""Chtr"" might refer to a tech company, and this is talking about investment thoughts on Google. So again, related to Google.

6. ""are you hanging on to $ sgen $ goog $ flo $ lgnd wallstreet URL"" – Wallstreet could be referring to Wall Street stocks, but the tweets are all about Google and similar companies like Facebook, Instagram, etc.

7. ""this weeks stocks you should watch $ ntrs $ lrcx $ fl $ goog investing URL"" – ""Ntrs"" might refer to a company like Nest or a tech company, so again related to Google.

8. ""small-cap stocks breaking 52 - wk high prices $ frx $ adt $ fe $ goog check out URL"" – This is about the stock market trend, suggesting positive sentiment as companies break out of an uptrend.

9. ""todays movers to research $ tif $ amgn $ goog $ isrg try this URL"" – Movers are companies that rise in the market, so this might indicate positive about Amzn gaining traction.

10. ""great stock newsletter on $ seic $ vmw $ wcn $ goog liquidity URL"" – Liquidity is a factor for investors, but it's more general and doesn't specifically mention Google or another company.

11. ""$ ฿ : 480 € , 658 $ $ eurusd : 1.37 $ eurgbp : 0.80 $ eurbrl : 3.01 $ aapl : 94 $ ( +0.80 % ) $ goog : 584 $ ( +1.49 % ) $ nasdaq : +1.14 % s & p500 : +0.66 %"" – This is a financial quote, but it's about the stock prices of Apple and the S&P 500, suggesting a positive market trend.

12. ""great stock newsletter on $ clwr $ unp $ ddd $ goog wealthmanagement URL"" – Again, referring to Google as the main company here.

13. ""this weeks stocks you should watch $ trw $ adsk $ aes $ goog nse URL"" – This is about investing in Nest, so related to Google.

14. ""$ enh is it breakout time on $ dre $ asna $ goog liquidity URL"" – Breakout refers to a stock rising sharply, which could indicate positive sentiment for some investors.

15. ""get research on $ akam $ cost $ mb $ goog nasdaq URL"" – Again, about Google and its NASDAQ performance.

16. ""top performing stocks today $ hxl $ alks $ stx $ goog liquidity URL"" – Top performers suggest strong company news or earnings, which is positive sentiment.

17. ""great stock newsletter you must have $ aa $ lb $ ew $ goog singedinvestor URL"" – This seems to be a general investment announcement about Google and investors, so positive.

18. ""best pennystock research $ agnc $ cbg $ bio $ goog research URL"" – Best penny stocks are small-cap companies, so again, related to Google or similar.

19. ""are you looking for winners like $ noc $ pii $ goog $ cadx check out URL"" – Winners in the stock market, positive sentiment about certain companies.

20. ""timed to be stealthy ? eclipsed by world cup chatter ... rt AT_USER google buys songza URL $ goog"" – This is a specific offer, but it's a bit unclear if it's positive or negative. Google buying songza might be a positive action for the company, indicating support from investors.

Now, compiling this all together, each tweet either directly mentions Google (tweets 4-20) or refers to other companies that are related to Google stock. The sentiments vary based on whether the tweet is critical, positive, or neutral about Google. Positive tweets include comments praising Apple and Google's performance, while negative ones have more factual or skeptical comments.

However, some tweets like #13 mention Nest, which isn't Google but still related to tech companies. So I might consider it as a positive if it's indicating confidence in the company. Similarly, tweet 20 is about Google buying stock, which could be seen as positive for investor support.

Overall, most tweets are either directly about Google or referring to other tech stocks that might be part of the broader tech sector or financials. The sentiment tends to be a mix of positive and neutral towards Google's performance in different areas like technology, market trends, etc."
2014-07-02,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze the given tweets to determine their impact on the future stock price of a company. The user provided specific steps and instructions, so I'll go through each tweet carefully.

First, I notice that the target stock is missing in all the tweets. That means I don't have enough information about which specific stock they're referring to, making it challenging to assess their impact on its price.

Looking at the other factors, most tweets mention stock symbols or companies related to the company's products or services. For example, ""get free research on $ onnn ... overvalued URL"" and others seem to be about potential investments or newsletters related to specific stocks.

However, without knowing which stock each tweet refers to, it's impossible to evaluate how each tweet affects that particular stock. Each tweet could mention different stocks, and their sentiment might vary depending on the context provided in the tweets themselves.

Since I don't have any target stock information or direct sentiment analysis of these tweets about a specific stock, I can't come up with an overall positive, neutral, or negative sentiment for them collectively. Without this context, my analysis is incomplete.

Therefore, I conclude that it's not possible to determine the likely impact on the stock price without knowing which company is being referred to in each tweet and their individual sentiments towards that specific stock."
2014-07-03,Neutral,"Alright, I need to figure out the likely impact of these tweets on the stock price of the given company. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the user provided a list of ten tweets and instructed me to analyze their potential effects. They also specified that each tweet should be evaluated based on positive, negative factors, sentiment analysis, and then combine them for an overall conclusion.

Looking at the first tweet: ""$ googl $ goog grinding ever so slightly higher | still holding full positions ( no update today ) URL"". It mentions Google being slightly higher but says it's not updating. That suggests a slight positive note because of the ""grazing"" part, maybe indicating some confidence or optimism. But since there's no immediate update, I'm not sure if this is significant enough to be positive.

The second tweet talks about Apple spending $10 billion annually on R&D and acquiring companies every week starting 2010. This seems positive because it highlights a strong financial performance by Apple. High investment in research and development often indicates growth potential, which can boost stock prices. So this is probably a positive factor.

Third tweet from pennystock mentions $ mrvl , $ car , $ mrk on Google's URLs. The mention of Google's name suggests a connection or potential for increased sales or acquisition, which could be positive sentiment.

Fourth tweet says Google's stock is being discussed in terms of Apple's plans to launch Siri after falling behind. That implies that the company might see growth opportunities or improvements, leading to a positive outlook on Google stocks.

Fifth tweet details Joe Biden talking about ""billionaires"" and specific tech stocks like TSLA, YELP, LII, GOOG, VIX. This seems more like a neutral statement because it's unrelated to the company's performance but rather an update or commentary on its broader market.

Sixth tweet suggests seeking a hot investment from pennystock about Google. If someone is investing in Google, their interest might come from improving or new opportunities, so this could be positive.

Seventh tweet mentions absurdity of Europe's right to be forgotten, linking it back to Google. That could imply that the company's image or story is gaining attention, which might boost investor sentiment.

Eighth and ninth tweets are about investing in specific stocks like UHAL, Pra, AtML, etc., but they don't provide information about Google. So this section isn't relevant unless these stocks have positive implications for Google. Without info on the companies themselves, it's hard to assess their impact.

Putting it all together: The second tweet is clearly positive with high financial spending. The fifth tweet is neutral and unrelated. The seventh tweet hints at a positive note due to Europe's attention. The other tweets are either too vague or unrelated.

I think the overall sentiment isn't entirely positive because while there are positive factors like Apple spending, nothing about Google itself is mentioned here. There's also some neutral content and speculative investing which might not directly impact the stock price as much."
2014-07-04,Positive,"Alright, so I have to analyze these tweets to determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative for the stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I need to figure out what the target stock is from the tweets. But looking at them, none mention specific stocks. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe it refers to general sentiment about tech companies in general?

Alright, let me start with tweet 1: ""rt AT_USER unbelievable rt AT_USER story about ex-merrill lynch ceo removed from some google searches : URL"". This seems like a breaking news tweet where someone is mentioning an ex-CEO who was removed by Google. That's a significant event that could impact investor sentiment negatively because it affects the company they're associated with.

Next, tweet 2: ""$ tpx is it breakout time on $ krft $ fdo $ goog must have URL"". It looks like there are multiple stocks listed with their symbols and codes related to the Google logo. This seems like a warning or research note about potential breakthroughs on Google-related stock. If someone thinks there's a break-out, that's positive but followed by URLs indicating the link. I'm not sure if it's positive yet.

Tweet 3: ""$ emc best pennystock research $ mcd $ blk $ goog must have URL"". Similar to tweet 2, multiple stocks and Google elements. Again, this is about potential tech or financial breakthroughs that could affect the stock price positively.

Tweet 4: ""do you think you should hold $ cat $ man $ phm $ goog stockmarket URL"". The words ""hold"" suggest the sentiment towards investing in a particular stock. But without knowing if it's bullish or bearish, it's hard to tell. Maybe positive if they're thinking about staying invested.

Tweet 5: ""$ clf find more winners like $ uri $ cfr $ goog personalfinance URL"". Similar structure as tweet 2 and 3, multiple stocks with Google elements. Positive because of the potential for winners in tech or financial areas.

Tweet 6: ""$ hot stocks to watch this week $ taho $ cma $ goog wallstreet URL"". Another list of stocks related to Google's logo. This looks positive because it suggests a focus on high-potential stocks, which could drive up prices.

Tweet 7: ""$ aes today's movers to research $ cnp $ seas $ goog money rate_limit_exceeded"". The mention of money rate limit exceeded is interesting. It seems like the company is concerned about financial regulations or rates, which could affect their stock performance negatively if there are constraints that aren't ideal.

Tweet 8: ""are you bullish on these stocks $ chk $ p $ trow $ goog singedinvestor URL"". Positive again, as it's a direct mention of being bullish. This implies confidence in the company's future performance.

Tweet 9: ""are you bullish on these stocks $ bll $ mdt $ ecl $ goog investing URL"". Another positive outlook with the intention to invest. It suggests confidence about the stock's potential.

Tweet 10: ""are you bullish on these stocks $ gci $ trip $ scty $ goog economy URL"". Similar approach, focusing on bullish sentiments and investments in economic sectors.

Tweet 11: ""are you hanging on to $ kos $ chtr $ tkr $ goog check out URL"". A neutral stance as it indicates uncertainty about the stock. It doesn't express strong bullish or bearish sentiment yet.

Lastly, tweet 12: ""awesome stock research $ chk $ p $ trow $ goog singedinvestor URL"". Positive again, suggesting a desire to research and invest in the company's stocks.

Putting it all together, most tweets mention Google elements, potential breakthroughs, investment intentions, or financial concerns. The combination of positive statements like bullish sentiment, investment intent, and mentions of tech companies suggests that overall, there is optimism for the stock price."
2014-07-05,Neutral,"Alright, I'm going to tackle this query step by step. The user provided a set of tweets and wants me to determine their impact on a given company's stock price. They want my analysis divided into three steps: identifying the target stock symbol, analyzing each tweet for positive or negative factors, assessing sentiment, and then summing up the overall effect.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the tweets, all of them seem related to stocks. For example, ""top stocks today . find out why . $ pl $ qep $ lh $ goog check out URL"" mentions Google as a possible target. So I'll go with ""Google"".

Next, for each tweet, I have to separate positive and negative factors. Let's look at the first tweet: ""top stocks today . find out why . $ pl $ qep $ lh $ goog check out URL"". The factors here are ""pl"", ""qep"", ""lh"", and ""goog"". Pl likely stands for Positive Letter, which might mean favorable news or stock performance. QEP could refer to specific sectors or companies. LH probably stands for Loss Avoidance, meaning the writer is avoiding losses by mentioning goog. So, both positive factors (pl) and negative (lh). That's a mix.

Moving on, tweet 2: ""$ spls awesome stock research $ cpwr $ nsm $ goog financial URL"". Factors are ""spls"", ""cpwr"", ""nsm"", and ""goog"". SLS might stand for Stock Letter or something similar. CPWR could be a typo for something else, maybe ""CPWR"" stands for something like a company name. NSM is possibly stock info. Google is the main target. I'm not sure about ""spls"" and ""cpwr""; maybe they are placeholders or typos. So, positive factors might be ""goog"", with others unclear.

Tweet 3: ""$ pcp are you thinking of selling $ r $ hfc $ goog research URL"". Factors are ""pcp"", ""you"", ""think"", ""sell"", ""r"", ""hfc"", and ""goog"". PCP could be another stock letter, maybe positive. Think about selling that stock (negative). R might stand for ""Rate Limit Exceeded"" from a previous tweet, which is negative. HFC as well; not sure what it stands for.

Tweet 4: ""are you investing in $ cbst $ rax $ ew $ goog must have rate_limit_exceeded"". Factors are ""cbst"", ""rax"", ""ew"", ""goog"", and ""rate_limit_exceeded"". CBT might be a stock letter, RAX could be another company. EW stands for Equities & Weather, which is unrelated. Rate limit exceeded (negative).

Tweet 5: ""$ rkt $ vc $ bmc $ goog view now URL"". Factors are ""rkt"", ""vc"", ""bmc"", and ""goog"". RKT might be a stock letter. VC could stand for Value Investing or other factors. BMC is a company; not sure about its impact on Google.

Tweet 6: ""are you bullish on these stocks $ ilmn $ cvc $ ugi $ goog money rate_limit_exceeded"". Factors are ""bullish"", ""culmn"", ""cvc"", and ""unga"". BULLISH indicates positive, CVCM is unclear; UGA could be another stock. Money limit exceeded (negative).

Tweet 7: ""$ pii $ goog $ hts $ gain wealthmanagement URL"". Factors are ""pii"", ""goog"", ""hts"", and ""gain wealthmanagement"". PII stands for price, income, profit, which relates to Google's performance. HTS might be a typo or something else.

Tweet 8: ""$ cnh stock watchlist . dont be left behind $ intu $ cboe $ goog stock URL"". Factors are ""cnh"", ""watchlist"", and ""intu"". CNH could refer to a company, but I'm not sure. Intu is unclear.

Tweet 9: ""$ dre $ dte $ ppg $ goog moneymanagement URL"". Factors are ""dre"", ""dte"", ""ppg"", and ""goog"". DRE might be a stock letter, DTE another. PPG could stand for price or performance.

Tweet 10: ""buying or selling ? $ cvi $ sats $ ame $ goog nse rate_limit_exceeded"". Factors are ""buying/selling"", ""cvi"", ""sat"", and ""goog"". CVI is unclear; SATS might be a typo. Rate limit exceeded (negative).

Tweet 11: ""seeking the next stock like $ nrg $ pll $ clx $ goog check out URL"". Factors are ""next"", ""nrg"", ""pll"", ""clx"", and ""goog"". NRG is another stock letter; PL might be a typo.

Now, summing up the sentiments. Most tweets mention Google's performance ( goog in several), but others have mixed signals with positive letters and negative terms. For example, tweet 1 has both positive and negative factors. Similarly, tweets 2 and 4 suggest potential investments or concerns about rates. Some tweets are placeholders.

Overall, there's a mix of positive and negative elements, suggesting uncertainty or conflicting information about Google's performance. Since the user is asking for stock price impact, it's hard to conclude definitively without more context on what each factor means. But considering the presence of both positive and negative factors, I'm leaning towards a [Neutral] sentiment as the likely outcome."
2014-07-06,Neutral,"Okay, I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on a company's stock price based on the provided analysis. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

1. **Are you considering selling TDG, CMP, CEG, GOOG?** - This seems like a straightforward question from a buyer, so that would be negative because it affects their sentiment.
2. **Like AMR, CRM, GOOG for a try?** - Again, this is about buying stocks on social media, which is negative for an investor looking to sell.
3. **Looking for winners like ELM, MDU, KRY, GOOG?** - Positive because it's about finding gains, so positive sentiment.
4. **Android sales in China, Germany, Italy and the U.S.: GOOG equity?** - This is a positive headline but might be a sign of speculative buying, contributing to positive sentiment.
5. **HCBK stocks to watch next week on GLW, SYSU, GOOG equity?** - Positive because it's about potential gains, so overall positive.
6. **Like ALK, TMO for liquidity?** - Negative because it could lead to price drops if they are bought.
7. **Get the latest on MSG, ROP, SLG on WSL?** - Positive because it's another buy signal.
8. **Looking for the next $CPRT, ROP, GOOG worth a look?** - Maybe buying more, so positive sentiment.
9. **RT at_USER android sales in CHN, GERM, ITA, U.S.: GOOG wallstreet?** - Positive because it's about potential gains on Wall Street.
10. **Are you bullish on these stocks? UHNN BMRN GEF GOODE research rate_limit_exceeded?** - This is a direct question from someone, so negative sentiment.
11. **Pennystock research on CCC, TWX, CBS, GOOG try this URL?** - Positive because it's about buying, contributing to positive sentiment.
12. **Like NATI, NVE for liquidity:** Negative because buying can lead to price drops.
13. **Find more winners like MRYL VEO GOS: Positive, so overall positive.
14. Keeping eye on CI, YCB, AA, GOOG? Positive because it's about potential buys.
15. Earnings info on TWO, SAI, QEP, GOOFL: Negative if earnings are bad, but not sure here; needs more context.
16. LIKE LIFE, NNN for breakout time on NATI, NVE: Negative because buying could lead to drops.
17. Should you hold or add to MCHP EXR, ROP, GOS investing? Neutral or maybe slightly negative if avoiding losses.
18. GOOGLE - Can Google save 100k lives? Negative question, leading someone to sell stock.
19. Find more winners like GAS, PLCM, SLGN GOOG click URL: Positive buying signals.
20. Stocks to sell ZBR, FLT, PFG, GOOG goto: Negative because selling can drop price.
21. Are bullish on these stocks VNTA, LEN, MNX: Neutral or slightly negative if it's speculative buying.
22. Cop do you think you should hold PKG, CST, GOOG investing? Negative if overbought.
23. Should you sell or hold like ELK, MET, TPX GOOG NSE: Positive, so overall positive.
24. Find out latest on NTP, ALXN, MAO GOOG investing: Positive buying signals.
25. Great newsletter on PBCT, BIG, NTRS, GOODE economy: Positive because it could lead to price changes.
26. BEST research on stocks like L, PSAR, GOOG WallStreet: Neutral because just research doesn't always mean buy.
27. GOOGLE - Is Microsoft poised to go higher? Negative question leading to negative sentiment towards stock.
28.Bearish or bullish VC, JC, JCP GOG liquidity: Positive if bullish and negative if bearish.
29. RT at_USER popular browsers from 2009-2014 MSFT, GOOG URL: Neutral because it's about market data, not stocks.
30. Social media trends on DPO, GLD, GOOG FB SPY APL: Positive selling signals, but overall impact unclear.
31. This weeks stocks to watch WFC, EOG SM GOOG must see: Positive buying signal.

Overall, the tweets show a mix of positive (buying) and negative (selling, watching for price drops, overbought) sentiment, as well as some speculative calls. Without knowing how these actions are affecting individual investor sentiment, it's hard to assess overall impact. Maybe some days the stock goes up, others down."
2014-07-07,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of the given company. The user wants me to assess each tweet's effect as either Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from the first tweet: ""swks best pennystock research awi nlsn goog moneymanagement url."" Wait, that seems odd because pennystock is a nick name for penny stocks. But the other tweets mention something like ""penny stocks"" and specific stocks like ""grtc,"" so maybe I need to correct or consider that first.

Looking at the tweets one by one:

1. $ swks best pennystock research $ awi nlsn $ goog moneymanagement url - Hmm, this is confusing with ""swks"" which doesn't make sense as a stock symbol. Maybe it's a typo or something else entirely. I'll note that.

2. $ hca are you hanging on to $ clgx $ cop $ goog give it a try url - This seems like a sales pitch. The user is encouraging others to invest in Cl gx, Cop, and goog. So this could be positive because it's promoting the stock.

3. $ twc stock watchlist . dont be left behind $ goog orly nuan try this rate_limit_exceeded - This tweet promotes trading on goog and mentions other stocks like orly and nuan. It seems to suggest actively managing the portfolio, which is neutral as it doesn't directly indicate a good or bad outcome.

4. stocks you might want to sell $ hii $ aeo $ bpop $ goog wallstreet rate_limit_exceeded - Again, promoting selling positions on certain stocks while also mentioning selling on wallstreet. This could be positive because it's encouraging market participants to act.

5. looking for the next $ ufs $ abt $ pru $ goog research url - Promoting a search for next research, which is often seen as proactive and possibly positive if investors are seeking information.

6. great pennystock research $ var $ shw $ cvd $ goog stock rate_limit_exceeded - Similar to tweet 1, this seems confusing due to the ""penny stocks"" mentioned but also contains typo-like terms like ""var."" This could be either positive or negative depending on how it's interpreted.

7. are you thinking of investing in $ vz $ hta $ nwl $ goog must have url - Promoting an investment thought process, suggesting that they're considering the stock. This is neutral because it's speculative and not providing a clear market outlook.

8. could be breaktout time on $ goog blk fcs qlys check out url - This tweet mentions potential breakthroughs on goog but doesn't provide concrete information or a specific outcome. It seems neutral as it doesn't give a clear direction.

9. trading up to a new smartphone is starting to resemble getting a new car $ aapl goog url - This suggests the company is preparing for an upcoming event, which might be positive because it's proactive. However, without specifics, it's somewhat speculative.

10. should you buy , sell or hold $ fds $ cxo $ mnst $ goog nasdaq url - Promoting multiple investment options: buying, selling, holding. This could be seen as a mix of positive (hold) and speculative, so overall neutral.

11. $ goog max pain = 570.00 . maturity = 07/11 / 2014 . previous close = 584.73 . url - This seems like financial news about goog reaching a certain price point. It's likely positive because it affects investor sentiment based on expected performance.

12. as $ goog cofounders say $ aapl should work on more projects , a new cook profile says employees are worried they ' re working on 2 many projects - This is a negative statement. The user is implying that other companies (apple and another) have been focusing on multiple projects, which might lead to instability or lack of focus.

13. $ gpc free research on $ rgld $ isca $ goog view now url - Promoting research, which can sometimes indicate investor interest in a stock but doesn't always mean positive news unless it's related to the company's performance.

14. are you hanging on to $ gra $ tyc $ swi $ goog i suggest url - Similar to tweet 2 and 3, this is promoting investments in different stocks, suggesting active management of the portfolio.

15. looking for the next winners like $ fcs $ wpo $ pfg $ goog try this url - Promoting search results on financials or upcoming trends related to these companies, which could be positive if they are promising.

16. here are some stocks to watch $ rbc $ wtm $ ni $ goog stockmarket url - Encouraging potential investors to follow the stock market, which is neutral as it's a general recommendation without specifics.

17. cab pennystock research on $ lvs $ pm $ goog singedinvestor url - Promoting an investment thought process and suggesting specific stocks, which is neutral because it's speculative.

18. sick and tired of losing money on $ hig $ hnt $ jcp $ goog newsletter url - Negative statement about the company's financial performance, indicating potential issues with losing money.

19. molx seeking the next hot pennystock $ clr $ pnw $ goog wealthmanagement rate_limit_exceeded - Promoting a search for a new hot stock but mentioning that they can't proceed because of limited resources or something else, which might be seen as negative due to constraints.

After analyzing each tweet, I need to determine if there's a trend or pattern. Many tweets are promoting investments (2-19), which is positive. However, some mention things like rate limits or specific projects that could be negative. The overall sentiment seems mixed because while many are positive, others indicate potential risks or constraints.

I think the overall sentiment leans towards neutral because there's a mix of positive and speculative investments without clear trends. However, the one tweet about rate_limit_exceeded might carry some weight as it could affect decision-making."
2014-07-08,Neutral,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about the stock price of GOOG. So, the user provided 17 tweets and asked to determine their impact on GOOG's future stock price. Hmm, the instructions are a bit specific, so I need to take them step by step.

First, I think I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. The target seems to be GOOG because most of these tweets mention GOOG or related companies like TIF, STR, HME, VZ, etc. So I can assume GOOG is the target stock here.

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate them into positive and negative factors. But wait, looking at the tweets, some are repeats or have similar messages. For example, there are a lot of ""apple's annual profit triple google's 2013 earnings"" repeated multiple times. That might indicate a strong positive signal from apple's performance, which could affect GOOG if they're related.

Then, I need to assess the sentiment for each tweet. Sentiment can be positive, negative, or neutral based on the tone and content. For instance, tweets that make a statement about profitability or performance are usually positive because it can attract investors looking for growth. But wait, some tweets seem more critical or uncertain, like ""great pennystock research $ itw $ goog $ bbby $ fb investing URL"" which might be negative.

I also need to look at each tweet and see if they're related to GOOG. For example, the 2nd tweet is about stock market timing on certain stocks, which doesn't directly relate to GOOG. But looking back, tweets 1-4 mention TIF, STR, HME, VZ, which are all different stocks but related. However, none of them specifically target GOOG.

Wait a minute, the user's target stock is GOOG, so I need to make sure that each tweet is relevant to GOOG. For example, if a tweet talks about TIF trading or something else unrelated, it doesn't directly affect GOOG.

Looking at each tweet:

1. Insider trading alerts on $ tif $. Hmm, TIF could be a related stock but not GOOG.
2. Breakout time on $ str $ dow $ drq $. Again, different stocks.
3. Stock research on $ hme $ nflx $ jazz $. Also different companies.
4. Newsletter about GOOG. This might indicate that GOOG is doing well because the user is following them and mentioning something they'll share later.

5. Selling suggestions on $ nus $ lii $ avt $. Not directly related to GOOG unless there's a correlation, but I don't see it here.
6. Buying/selling advice on $ gme $ pbi. Different stocks again.
7. Stock research on $ kmi $ vz $ goog moneymanagement. Again, different companies.

8. Apple's annual profit triple Google's 2013 earnings. This is a significant statement from an unrelated company, but it could influence GOOG if there are any synergies or potential for investment in similar companies.

9-10: Same as tweet 8, so they might be redundant or indicate strong positive signals.

11-12: Stock research on $ wdr and $ mdu $. Different stocks; not related to GOOG unless there's a pattern here that I'm missing. For example, stock watchlist doesn't directly relate to GOOG unless the user is following GOOG, which they are from tweet 4.

13-15: General statements about internet service providers or stock market trends on GOOG. These could be positive as they might indicate overall market conditions affecting GOOG's performance.

16: A general outlook on Google stocks. This could be a mix of positive and negative but leans towards a positive outlook based on the statement mentioning growth potential.

17: Research on IT, investing in Facebook and YouTube videos about Google. Again, unrelated to GOOG unless there's a pattern in stock watching related to GOOG performance.

So, putting this together: most tweets are not directly about GOOG, but some make statements that could be positive if the companies mentioned are related or if there are synergies with GOOG. For example, tweet 4 mentions that GOOG is ""next"" for apple's profits, which could attract investors interested in both companies.

However, other tweets talk about selling or buying stocks (tweets 5-10), which might indicate investor sentiment moving towards selling rather than holding, possibly affecting GOOG stock price. Additionally, tweet 16 suggests growth potential on Google, which is a positive note for investors looking to buy GOOG.

But overall, without direct mentions of GOOG, the sentiment is a mix of positive and negative signals about related companies. But since most tweets are either about other stocks (like TIF, STR) or have mixed intent with selling/buying, it's hard to conclude a strong overall positive or negative impact on GOOG.

Wait, tweet 14 mentions ""do not be left behind"" for Google stockwatchlist, which might imply that the user is encouraging investors to hold more of GOOG, but it's still unclear. However, most other tweets either don't target GOOG directly or are about selling stocks, so there's a mix.

I think the overall sentiment is neutral because while some tweets suggest positive things (like synergies with apple and growth potential), others indicate mixed signals (selling intent). There might be overlapping with related companies but not direct impact on GOOG."
2014-07-09,Negative,"Alright, so I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company and classify them as positive, neutral, or negative. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

Starting with the first tweet: ""this weeks stocks you should watch $ htz $ bkw $ vmw $ goog view now URL"". This seems like an informational tweet about investing in specific stocks. It doesn't mention any positive or negative sentiment towards the stock prices, just indicating investor interest. So probably neutral.

Second tweet: ""best pennystock research $ lvlt $ nve $ efx $ goog click URL"". Similar to the first one, this is a call for investment and mentions multiple stocks but no explicit information about profit or loss. It's more of an alert than a sentiment analysis. So again, probably neutral.

Third tweet: ""$ xls are you investing in $ fii $ frt $ goog singedinvestor URL"". This seems to be a warning about potential investments. The language is encouraging others to consider investing but doesn't specify how the stock would perform. It's a bit vague, so I'll lean towards neutral.

Fourth tweet: "" todays stocks you should watch $ nee $ itc $ endp $ goog nasdaq URL"". Another call for investment with specific stocks and an event mention like NASDAQ being up. This is more about planning investments but doesn't express positive or negative expectations on the stock prices. Still leaning towards neutral.

Fifth tweet: ""$ alb is it breakout time on $ aon $ sd $ goog liquidity URL"". Here, the tweet mentions a potential break-even point in tech and Google's liquidity. It suggests that if they meet the criteria, their stock might be worth more. This implies that Google could see growth, which might affect investor sentiment positively. So this is positive.

Sixth tweet: ""rt AT_USER der weg zum monopol : wie google beinahe verscherbelt worden wäre $ goog URL"". This seems like a request from a user to reach out if Google would fail in a market where they have a monopoly. It's more of a warning and doesn't provide clear information on stock performance, so perhaps slightly negative.

Seventh tweet: ""jake 13 : $ goog opinion today click here to find out if URL"". Another direct request for opinions without any positive or negative language. So probably neutral.

Eighth tweet: ""$ itc are you considering selling $ intu $ agn $ goog moneymanagement URL"". This is a sell-side warning regarding money management products from ITC. It doesn't predict gains but indicates concerns about potential losses, so this would be negative.

Ninth tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ vmw $ ctxs $ rht $ emc $ goog $ amzn $ msft wells says vmware growth could slow , downgrades shares : full story URL"". This is a warning from the user regarding a potential slowdown in VMware, which they believe will lead to share downgrades. This suggests that the company might face issues affecting their stock performance, so this would be negative.

Tenth tweet: ""shitty day for $ nybd . looking to make back my profits tomorrow on $ ubqu . stocks on watch : $ ubqu $ aapl $ goog $ ntek $ iwm stockmarket"". This seems like a general frustration or criticism about a tough day and the user's attempt to sell stocks. The language is more negative in tone but not explicitly positive towards the stock prices, so maybe slightly negative.

Eleventh tweet: ""$ avav breaking out big now . earnings beat drone play $ goog $ mu $ fb $ f $ z $ ba $ hpq $ tsla $ amzn $ gluu $ scty $ fslr $ jd $ onvo $ ddd $ ssys $ xone"". This is a call for investment with various stocks. It's about specific investments but doesn't express positive sentiment towards the companies listed, so neutral.

Twelfth tweet: ""stockgenie alets magical source of profits $ aeye $ cmgo $ goog & more ! followandprofit nasdaq makemoney stockaction stockmarket"". This is an offer to trade or promote trading. It's a promotion tactic rather than providing information about stock performance, so probably neutral.

Thirteenth tweet: ""$ best pennystock research $ zbra $ cop $ kmt $ goog view now URL"". Similar to previous positive calls for investment but with different stocks and the option to view more info. No sentiment expressed here, so likely neutral.

Now, compiling all these thoughts:

- Tweets 1-3 and 4 are about investments and general market alerts.
- Tweet 5 is a positive warning due to potential growth in tech companies.
- Tweets 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 are negative or slightly negative.
- The rest are neutral.

So overall sentiment should be negative because several tweets are pointing towards negative developments (VMware growth slowing), while others are cautiously positive but not strong. The mix of mixed signals leads to a negative conclusion."
2014-07-10,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the future stock price of a company. The user provided 12 tweets, but the target stock isn't specified in the query. I'll have to make some assumptions since it's not clear which company is being discussed.

First, I'll go through each tweet one by one to identify the positive and negative factors. For each tweet, I'll separate them into positives and negatives. Then, I'll assess how each tweet might influence investor sentiment overall.

Starting with the first tweet: ""$ uthr wow . great stock research on $ seic $ expd $ goog singedinvestor URL"". This seems like a research tweet aimed at investors looking for information about Google's stock. The word ""research"" and ""investor"" suggest this could be positive because it's targeting potential buyers.

The second tweet mentions ""should you buy $ m $ hot $ goog $ fb liquidity rate_limit_exceeded"". Here, the keyword ""liquidity"" is relevant. If there's a concern about liquidity, investors might feel nervous and thus be negative. The use of ""will buy"" could indicate a positive reaction if they expect better liquidity.

The third tweet talks about ""apple , inc . q3 earnings : 2 predictions ( aapl ): URL via AT_USER $ amzn $ googl ☆ $ aapl iwatch ☆ ¿ $ goog $ znga $ king ¿"". There are specific predictions about Google's earnings. If the company is expected to grow, especially in areas like AI or 5G, it could be seen as positive. But if there are concerns, it might be negative.

The fourth tweet: ""$ dei find more winners like $ seic $ cern $ goog wealthmanagement URL"". The word ""winners"" suggests that Google is gaining from new opportunities, which could be positive for investors. However, if the term ""winners"" is used in a negative context elsewhere, it might have mixed feelings.

The fifth tweet discusses an emergency law allowing email, texts, and calls. This could impact investor sentiment because regulatory changes can affect corporate actions. If Google needs to comply with such laws, it might raise questions about their ability to invest, leading to negative sentiment.

The sixth tweet mentions ""google ' c ' harry has systems in the hybrid cloud storage era"". The use of ""has"" suggests that Google's tech advancements are on par or even better than expected. This could be positive because it shows innovation and technological advancement, which is generally good for a company.

The seventh tweet: ""$ goog : google will open a $ 100 million venture capital fund in london URL"". A new venture capital deal can boost investor confidence and potentially increase stock price. It's a positive factor that might support the stock.

The eighth tweet talks about earnings news on ""rgld"", ""slh"", and ""goog financialnews"". If Google is expected to meet earnings targets, it could be a sign of good performance. However, if there are any negative news related to their earnings, it could turn this into a negative impact.

The ninth tweet: ""stocks you might want to sell $ foxa $ gpor $ abc $ goog overvalued URL"". Selling stock due to perceived value might indicate that the stock is overpriced. This can lead investors to sell and reduce their investment in Google, which is negative for the company's stock price.

The tenth tweet mentions ""vira ~ ~ huge dd , , , live interview , ceo holds 600m shares , news vira ~ ~ per transfer $ vira $ live $ api $ lnkd $ goog"". The mention of a CEO holding many shares suggests that Google is acquiring big entities, which could be seen as positive growth. However, if the term ""vira"" implies something negative or unrelated, it might affect sentiment negatively.

The eleventh tweet: ""$ vira ~ ~ next big mover , new cancer websites , URL $ vira $ big $ lnkd $ goog URL"". If Google is a big player in this sector and the tweet highlights potential growth areas, it could be positive. But if there's any negative speculation about their future performance, it might turn into a negative impact.

The twelfth tweet: ""$ goog - can google move higher ? -> URL stock stocks stockaction"". This seems like a straightforward query suggesting that Google might move up in price. It's a bit vague but could indicate investor interest or confidence, which is positive for the company.

After analyzing all tweets, I need to consider trends and overall sentiment. There are conflicting mentions of positive factors (like earnings, new projects) and some negative ones like regulatory changes and overvalued stock selling. Without more context about Google's current situation, it's hard to pinpoint a clear trend. However, the tweet suggesting that Google might move higher could be seen as an encouragement, which is positive.

But I also notice several mentions of technical issues or regulatory concerns, which can sometimes negate the optimistic outlook if investors expect these problems to cause股价 down. Additionally, selling stock due to perceived value could deter potential buyers, affecting sentiment negatively in the short term but maybe a mixed overall effect considering other factors.

Given that there are multiple positive and negative signs pointing towards Google's future performance, I'm leaning toward an overall Neutral stance because while some tweets suggest potential positives, others indicate concerns. It's hard to determine without knowing more about Google's current situation or market conditions."
2014-07-11,Negative,"Okay, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a given company based on the provided analysis. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, the user wants an output that summarizes the sentiment as either [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. The goal is to extract relevant factors and assess how each tweet might influence investor sentiment.

Starting with tweet 1: $ goog mentions Google vs Baidu. It seems like a search for investment URLs, which could be related to stock research. But it doesn't specify whether this will improve the company's stock. So it's likely neutral because it's speculative without concrete information.

Tweet 2: $ rht mentions insider trading updates on Unh acquire Hingey. This is serious and relates to financial news, which can affect investor sentiment negatively if there are concerns about insider threats or potential risks. But since it's just a tweet with no data points, it might be considered neutral because it's not providing specifics that could sway the stock.

Tweet 3: $ aee mentions insider trading on AEM and Google. Similar to tweet 2, this is financial news about insider trading, which can be negative if there are serious concerns or risks involved. Again, since it's speculative without details, it might remain neutral.

Tweet 4: $ ivz discusses research on IVZ, which is a stock mentioned in the tweet. If there's positive research that could improve market performance, this could indicate positive sentiment, but since it's vague and lacks context, it's unclear. So perhaps it's considered a bit of a gray area between positive and negative.

Tweet 5: $ fb mentions FB as a stock. If FB is affected by the internet information providers sector, which can impact the company. However, without specific details on how FB's performance would change, this tweet could be neutral or slightly negative.

Tweet 6: $ unm talks about Unh stock and mentions a try to get it done. This seems like speculative news without supporting claims about improving the stock. It might not have enough information to affect sentiment significantly, so I'll consider it neutral.

Tweet 7: $ goog mentions police and women in her death, then panics or calms. The tweet is more emotional and doesn't provide clear data points. It's likely a mix of positive and negative emotions without concrete evidence, making it neutral.

Tweet 8: $ goog updates its stock chart with thoughts about holding full positions. Positive action showing interest in the stock could indicate strong sentiment towards buying, which would be positive.

Tweet 9: $ wcrx discusses WTC's stock. Similar to tweet 5, speculative information without specific claims would likely remain neutral.

Tweet 10: $ goog talks about its perception not being affected by an executive's death. If the company doesn't see a direct effect from that event, it might be considered neutral because other factors like market conditions or macroeconomic data could influence sentiment.

Tweet 11: $ rrd mentions research on RRD, which is unclear without context about its impact on the stock. It's speculative and likely neutral.

Tweet 12: Asking if they're selling stocks related to $ gs, $ dis, etc., which are different from $ goog. This could indicate a positive outlook for the company or speculation about future stock performance, which might lean towards positive sentiment.

Tweet 13: $ cyt discusses research on COT. Similar to tweet 9, speculative information without context is likely neutral.

Tweet 14: $ cfn mentions bullish on $ cfm. Positive action could be seen as a sign of strong investor interest, making this tweet more likely to be positive.

Tweet 15: A bit of a complicated query about AWS cash flow affecting a price war with Google and Amazon. This is financial data that could impact stock prices if there's a news event related to pricing strategies or revenue. It seems like it's speculative but involves market dynamics, which can affect sentiment. However, without specific analysis, it might still be considered neutral.

Tweet 16: $ goog mentions going long on Evil Empire and being naked. This is speculative financial speculation, which could lead to mixed emotions. But given the context of a tweet without concrete details, it's likely neutral.

Tweet 17: Regretting an investment in $ scg. Similar to tweet 21, this is speculative but relates to past investments, so sentiment is unclear and likely neutral.

Tweet 18: $ clw mentions selling stocks related to $ cpb or jcp. Positive action for the company could indicate a positive outlook or interest from investors, which would lean towards positive sentiment.

Tweet 19: A query about Google becoming a NASDAQ member by 2014. This is speculative and involves a specific date in the past relative to current market conditions. It might not have enough context to determine sentiment definitively, so it's likely neutral.

Tweet 20: $ goog vs $ baidu for investment URLs. As with tweet 1, this is speculative search-related news, which doesn't provide strong information on stock performance. Neutral is the best fit here.

Tweet 21: Finding out about PPS financials from $ pps. Similar to tweet 4 and 23, speculative without specific context could be considered a bit of positive sentiment towards better financials, but since it's not detailed, it might be neutral or slightly negative.

Tweet 22: YouTube benefiting from longer viewing time with $ nflx. This is speculative about the impact on YouTube stock performance. It’s too vague to assess sentiment significantly, so likely neutral.

Tweet 23: Selling Google at a significant loss. Speculative transaction, but selling when it's about to go higher could indicate potential for positive price movement. This seems like a mix of positive and negative emotions without concrete data, making it neutral.

After reviewing all tweets, I'll summarize the overall sentiment based on positive, negative, or neutral factors. It seems there are several speculative tweets that don't provide strong information, but some have mixed feelings. The most significant positive tweet is tweet 8. There's a mix of positive and negative tweets related to stock speculation and market sentiment.

So, given the mixture of positive (tweets like 2,7,8) and negative (tweets like 1,5,6, etc.), but with some very speculative ones, I'll lean towards the overall sentiment being neutral."
2014-07-12,Positive,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price for $ tmhc pennystock. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First tweet is ""$ tmhc pennystock research on $ coh $ nve $ goog wealthmanagement URL"". Hmm, that's a bit confusing. It mentions several keywords: tmhc, pennystock, coh, nve, goog, wealthmanagement, and URL. I'm not sure what ""coh"" stands for here. Maybe it's a typo or abbreviation. ""Goog"" probably refers to Google. So the tweet is talking about research on $ Coh, which might be a company name or an identifier.

Since ""nve"" isn't clear, it's unclear if this is related to Google. But focusing on $ goog wealthmanagement, that could mean Google investing in their stock. If it's positive, that would boost the stock. However, without more context, I can't say for sure. Maybe some investors think Google is a good investment, but others might not see the company.

Next tweet: ""Coh pennystock on google wealthmanagement url"". Wait, this seems similar to the first one. It mentions coh, pennystock, goog, and wealth management. Again, without knowing what coh stands for, it's hard to assess. Maybe it's a typo or different terminology.

Both tweets are talking about Google investing in pennystock, which is their stock. Since Google has been doing various investments in tech companies, this could be positive because it suggests diversification and potentially good returns. But if coh isn't clearly defined, the sentiment might be uncertain.

I don't see any negative or neutral indicators here; both are focused on Google's wealth management business. So overall, based on the information given, I'd say there's a potential positive impact, especially since they're investing in a tech company."
2014-07-13,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on stock prices. Let me break it down step by step.

First, each tweet seems to be about a company or related financial terms. My task is to determine whether the overall sentiment of all these tweets is positive, neutral, or negative.

Starting with tweet 1: ""buy $ dnax dna energy drinks new ceo real experience > $ fnma $ hemp $ pmcm $ phot $ plpl $ cbis $ jpm $ gs $ ms $ tsla $ fb $ twtr $ goog $ msft"". The words like 'dnax', 'dna', and 'energy drinks' sound like company names. It mentions a CEO experience, which could be positive if the company is looking to bring in a experienced person. But it's not clear whether this directly affects the stock price or not.

Next, tweet 2: ""whats going on with $ cof $ zion $ anat $ goog must see URL"". The keyword here is 'goog', which I recognize as Google. This could be a typo or intentional. If it's about Google-related content, it might suggest that the company is doing something positive with their services.

Tweet 3: ""yahoo earnings - competing against amazon , google , & microsoft URL $ yhoo $ goog $ amzn $ msft investing AT_USER"". This tweet seems to be comparing Yahoo's earnings against competitors like Amazon and Microsoft. If Yahoo's performance is better, it could positively influence investors who are holding shares in these companies.

Tweet 4: ""$ kmb is it breakout time on $ goog $ hsh $ pcln give it a try URL"". The word 'kmb' isn't familiar to me as a company name. 'Breakout time' suggests that the stock might experience a significant increase, which would be positive. But without knowing what 'hsh' or 'pcln' stand for, I can't make much of this one.

Tweet 5: ""15 products you can almost always get for free URL via AT_USER $ goog $ amzn $ aapl AT_USER"". If it's about getting products at no cost, that could indicate good deals. This might attract investors looking for value, which is positive.

Finally, tweet 6: ""$ dbd best pennystock research $ esrx $ psa $ goog view now URL"". The word 'pennystock' doesn't ring a bell. If it's related to Google's stock, like a product or service, that could be a positive signal if they see good growth potential.

Now, considering each tweet's content and its impact:
- Tweet 1 might indicate a strategic move but not directly about the stock.
- Tweet 2 points towards Google, which is a big name in tech, so this could have a positive effect.
- Tweet 3 suggests Yahoo's performance affects multiple companies positively.
- Tweet 4 has 'kmb' and seems like it's about breaking into a breakout time on Google.
- Tweets 5 and 6 are about deals or good news related to Google.

Putting all together, while some tweets are more direct in suggesting positive factors (like Google-related), others might be more speculative. However, the overall sentiment seems positive because of the potential for gains from these trends, even if individual tweets don't directly mention the stock."
2014-07-14,Negative,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let's see what each tweet says and how they might affect it.

First, the target stock symbol is something missing here, but maybe from the context, I can figure out which one it is. Looking at the tweets, some mention iot internet of things (iot), others talk about tech companies like Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, etc.

Let me go through each tweet:

1. ""iot internet of things : shifting from proprietary to standard $ aapl $ goog $ googl $ msft URL internet bigdata"" – This seems unrelated and not directly linked to any stock except maybe an investment URL or something else. So probably not impacting the specific company we're focusing on.

2. ""$ goog : why $ 100 apple might be the easiest trade on wall street URL"" – I think this is talking about Apple trading, which could have positive implications if the stock is expected to rise due to good news like earnings or technology advancements.

3. ""google vs . baidu : the search for the best investment URL $ googl $ goog $ bidu"" – This seems like a comparison between Google and Baidu, but it doesn't specify any stock. Maybe not relevant unless there's implied information about Google's performance.

4. ""$ coo are you looking for winners like $ stx $ esv $ goog must have URL"" – ""Coo"" could be a typo or abbreviation; the main mention is looking for winners including Tesla (STX), Equities (ESV) and Google (GOO). If someone mentions Google as a potential winner, it might indicate positive sentiment about Google's performance.

5. ""$ platinum members saw our penny stock picks gain 4,000 % in 4 months this year ! huge update : URL $ amzn $ mcox $ goog"" – This tweet is talking about penny stocks (small companies) increasing by a lot. If these penny stocks are implying positive news for larger tech companies like Amazon or Microsoft, it could be a good signal.

6. ""rt AT_USER the surprising trait google looks for to identify potential leaders URL $ goog rt AT_USER"" – The user mentions Google's trait in identifying leaders. If this implies that Google is strong or innovative, it might boost investor confidence and positively impact the stock price.

7. "" hoy google inc . $ goog cerró a $ 584.87 ."" – ""Cerró"" means to close in Spanish. The tweet says Google closed at $584.87. If this is from a real trading update, it's important to check the current price and compare it with historical data or any news related to Google.

8. ""is it breakout time on $ wu $ vz $ spn $ goog worth a look URL"" – Breakout time means something happens suddenly that could change the stock. If the tweet is suggesting looking at stock prices of WU, VZ, SPN, GOOG for potential buy signals, this is positive.

9. ""$ ggp stocks to hold onto $ ddr $ ndaq $ goog check out URL"" – ""Ggp"" might be a typo or abbreviation; ""dqd"" not sure. It mentions GP stocks held because of DRR and NDAQ, which are tech sectors. If these companies are expected to perform well, it could boost the stock price.

10. ""$ amzn , $ aapl , $ fb , $ goog $$ amzn aapl fb goog URL"" – This tweet is comparing multiple tech stocks: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google. It's looking for specific names in their initials. Positive if these companies are seen as strong or upcoming.

11. ""platinum members saw our penny stock picks gain 4,000 % in 4 months this year ! huge update : URL $ ibm $ goog $ aapl"" – Similar to tweet 5, it's talking about penny stocks and a big increase, implying positive for tech companies like IBM or Apple.

12. ""are you bullish on these stocks $ cab $ goog $ fast $ ci liquidity URL"" – CUB (Cello Group), GOOG, FAST, CI Liquid. The mention of CIB and others might indicate that the company is doing well, which would be positive for their stock price.

13. ""hey $ goog and $ sne peeps ... are you aware of $ wdas ? they are trying to steal your revenues URL"" – The tweet suggests Google collaborating with Sneakers Inc. and being suspicious about revenue theft. If this relates to financial issues or trends, it might not be positive for the stock price unless it's a cause for concern.

14. ""$ tyc here are some stocks to watch $ fdx $ itw $ goog money URL""

These tweets seem to be talking about various companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, etc., mentioning things like earnings, stock performance, partnerships, financial issues, etc. It's a mix of positive and negative signals.

Now, considering all these points:

- Google is mentioned multiple times: in tweets 4,7,8,11,12.
- Apple is mentioned in tweet 2.
- Microsoft (MSFT) is in tweet 1.
- Amazon (AMZN) is in tweet 5 and 9.
- Facebook is in tweet 6.
- Baidu (BIDU) in tweet3.

From the tweets, it seems that Google is being discussed as a leading tech company with good news. Apple's stock performance has been mixed but could be positive if they are expected to improve. Microsoft is more cyclical and may not do well now. Amazon is expanding into new markets, which is good for growth.

The user mentions the tweet from platinum members seeing gains in penny stocks, implying potential for tech companies to rise. Google's closed price in tweet7 is a specific number, which might give context on its current valuation relative to others.

Considering all these factors—Google being strong, Apple potentially improving, Microsoft struggling, Amazon expanding—it's a mix of positive and negative signals, but the main positive indicators are Google and possibly Amazon expanding into new markets."
2014-07-15,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided a list of 17 tweets and asked for an assessment in terms of [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

Starting with tweet 1: ""looking for the next winners like $ agn $ tsla $ pii $ goog must have URL"". It mentions searching for stock prices related to AGN, TSLA, PII, and GOOG. This seems like a straightforward request, so maybe positive if someone is actively looking to buy.

Tweet 2: ""$ sd should you buy $ rsg $ bms $ goog i suggest URL"" suggests trying to buy stocks labeled RSG, BMS, and GOOG. This could be a call for action with clear instructions on what to do, which might be positive in terms of direct action but maybe not enough context.

Tweet 3: ""small-cap stocks breaking 52 - wk high prices $ aos $ bwc $ arw $ goog worth a look URL"" is about looking at small-cap stocks that have recently broken through into the past week. This shows interest in potential growth areas, so positive sentiment likely.

Tweet 4: ""should you hold or add to $ unh $ woof $ glng $ goog wallstreet URL"" asks if they should stay in a stock labeled UNH, WOF, GLNG, and WALLSTONE. This is more of an opinionated call to action, but without context on what Wall Stone does, it might be neutral.

Tweet 5: ""are you considering selling $ xray $ wdr $ gmt $ goog nse URL"" suggests interest in selling stocks labeled XRay, WDR, GMt, and GOOG. Similar to tweet 1, this could indicate a desire for direct action with specific stocks.

Tweet 6: ""rt AT_USER google search integrates bitcoin price calculator - URL via AT_USER $ goog"" tells the user to Google something related to Bitcoin and the price calculator. This is more of an informative tweet that's not directly buying anything.

Tweet 7: ""seeking the next stock like $ m $ sgen $ mhfi $ goog financial rate_limit_exceeded"" asks for the next stock similar to M, SGEN, MHFI, GOOG with a focus on limiting rates. This is more about research and possibly indicating interest in technical analysis, which could be positive.

Tweet 8: ""china's xiaomi called apple's ' true threat ' URL ibdnews via AT_USER $ aapl $ chl $ qcom $ msft $ googl $ goog"" tells the user to follow Apple for their position as a competitor. This is more of an opinion expressed that might not directly impact stock price but could suggest market expectations.

Tweet 9: ""$ goog - tech stocks : techs gain broadly ; apple rises on analyst upgrade URL"" mentions Google's performance in tech and its relation to Apple's earnings. Positive sentiment if the user thinks tech companies are good, which can boost a stock like GOOG.

Tweet 10: ""$ aapl are you looking to buy $ mfa $ mdlz $ goog give it a try rate_limit_exceeded"" asks about buying Stock MFA or MDMZ with Google. This is a direct call to action, indicating interest in the stock.

Tweet 11: ""$ cboe is it breakout time on $ abbv $ emc $ goog i suggest rate_limit_exceeded"" suggests looking for the best time to buy stocks labeled ABBV, EMC, and GOOG. Positive sentiment if the user thinks these companies are good.

Tweet 12: ""$ panw stocks you might want to sell $ tri $ acgl $ goog check out URL"" indicates wanting to sell specific stocks (PanW, TRI, ACGL) but not directly buying them. This could be a hedge or speculative action, possibly neutral if no clear direction is given.

Tweet 13: ""$ vnta get more info on $ zmh $ mhk $ goog research rate_limit_exceeded"" asks for information on ZNH and MHK stocks. Again, more of an inquiry rather than direct buying or selling.

Tweet 14: ""$ mar do you think you should hold $ siro $ isrg $ goog give it a try rate_limit_exceeded"" suggests considering holding a stock labeled SIRO, ISRG, GOOG but with specific actions like trying the stock. This could be a bit of a mix of positive (holding) and speculative.

Tweet 15: ""$ hot pennystock research on $ akam $ dri $ goog research URL"" asks about stocks AKAM, DRI, GOOG, which is direct research but not buying.

Tweet 16: ""rt AT_USER novartis , google to make blood sugar-tracking contact lens URL AT_USER $ nvs $ goog URL"" suggests researching Google's use of Novartis for something related to contact lenses. This could be a niche interest or investment in a specific application, positive if the user thinks this is relevant.

Tweet 17: ""AT_USER or ... what does it signal about driverless cars , if $ goog is adding board expertise in the form of alan mulally , if anything ? hmm"" talks about potential future developments with GOOG and ALAN MULAL. This could indicate a positive outlook, which might boost the stock.

After going through each tweet, most seem to be either direct requests or speculative opinions that don't provide enough context for a clear assessment. However, some tweets do hint at potential positive aspects, like tech stocks, driverless cars, or specific applications. The overall sentiment seems mixed but leans towards positive because of the speculative calls and interest in certain stocks."
2014-07-16,Negative,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how the given tweets impact the stock price of a company. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Scanning through them, I see mentions like ""msft"", "" goog "", and others. The most common one is msft, which stands for Microsoft. So, the target stock is Microsoft.

Next, each tweet provides factors that might influence investor sentiment towards Microsoft. Let me go through each tweet one by one to assess their impact.

1. The first tweet talks about assets trending in a watchlist with various companies like $ msft, $ ge, and others. It mentions employees but doesn't specify if it's positive or negative for Microsoft.

2. The second tweet is about being tired of losing money on stocks like chk, syk, mpc, etc., referencing Google. This seems to be a general sentiment that investors might have, but without specifics, I can't tell much.

3. The third tweet mentions Hing company's employees, which isn't directly related to Microsoft.

4. The fourth tweet talks about Google hiring hackers, which is unrelated to Microsoft.

5. The fifth tweet discusses the rate_limit_exceeded issue on lvs, rgc, goog, and tries to check the rate limit. Again, not relevant to Microsoft.

6. The sixth mentions acas, rlgy, sbac, goog, and economy rate_limit_exceeded. Not related to Microsoft.

7. The seventh tweet lists several stocks, including NVQT, FMCC, NEWL, etc., but nothing about Microsoft.

8. The eighth tweet is about financial news on stocks like unh, jbht, cmg, goog. No mention of Microsoft here either.

9. The ninth tweet mentions stocks like TRZU and LLY, not related to Microsoft.

10. The tenth tweet suggests breakout chance on mat, CNK, goog. Not relevant.

11. The eleventh tweet talks about RMX's status with RS and PGR. Not related to Microsoft.

12. The twelfth mentions RAX and newsletter on LO and WDC. No link here.

13. The thirteenth discusses the next intu stock, which isn't Microsoft.

14. The fourteenth talks about stocks related to JLL and wallstreet, again not Microsoft.

15. The fifteenth tweet says that a surging tech stock is headed back down due to Google. This suggests that the stock might recover, but it's speculative and not specific to Microsoft.

16. The sixteenth mentions research on RKT and others suggesting rate_limit_exceeded. No connection to Microsoft.

17. The seventeenth talks about Duke's stock with rate_limit_exceeded. Not related to Microsoft.

18. The eighteenth mentionsuyoung, amd, goog, which is about Google, not Microsoft.

19. The nineteenth has pennystock research on Cl, GGG, goog, Arna. Again, unrelated.

Looking at all these tweets, none of them mention Microsoft directly or in a way that affects investor sentiment towards its stock price. They mostly discuss various tech stocks and financial topics but don't provide specific info about Microsoft's performance. Therefore, I can't determine any positive, negative, or neutral sentiment from these tweets."
2014-07-17,Negative,"Alright, so I need to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the future stock price of a company based on the provided instructions. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I remember that the process involves identifying the target stock symbol from each tweet and then analyzing each tweet for positive or negative factors, assessing the sentiment towards those factors, and then combining all these analyses to get an overall sentiment.

Looking at the tweets, they seem to be discussing earnings reports, stock performance, and upcoming research topics. Each tweet talks about a company's earnings or future research but doesn't mention specific stocks. Hmm, that might make it tricky because I don't have the exact stock symbols here.

Wait, the user provided a list of 20 tweets without any stock symbols. That could be an issue. I need to figure out how to proceed with these. Maybe each tweet is about different companies or unrelated entities? If so, how can I determine their stock price impact?

Alternatively, perhaps the target stock symbol isn't included in the tweets provided. Without a specific stock mentioned, it's impossible to analyze its actual performance. This seems like a problem because one of the output requirements is to conclude with an overall sentiment regarding the company's future stock price.

Maybe all these tweets are part of a broader analysis or context that's not visible here. Or perhaps the user made a mistake in including only non-stocks? 

But since I don't have any stock symbols, how can I proceed? I might be missing some information or making an assumption that isn't stated. Maybe each tweet refers to the same company, but it's just not listed because it's not part of this specific set.

Alternatively, perhaps these are all unrelated to a particular stock, and their impact is speculative without knowing the actual market conditions or current trends. That would make the analysis incomplete because I can't assess the real-time impact on any specific stock.

Wait, looking back at the instructions, it says to analyze each tweet's impact on the future stock price of a given company. Since all tweets don't have the target stock symbol, maybe they are part of an external analysis or market review that's not detailed here.

I'm stuck because I can't determine the sentiment without knowing which stock is being referred to in each tweet. Without that information, it's impossible to assess whether each tweet positively or negatively affects a particular stock.

Perhaps the user made a mistake and included these tweets out of context, but since I have to respond based on what I see, maybe I should consider that each tweet might be referring to different companies, and without their symbols, I can't evaluate their performance.

In conclusion, without knowing which stock is being analyzed in each tweet or having the specific stock symbol provided, it's impossible to determine whether these tweets will have a positive, neutral, or negative impact on any given company. This information is missing, so my analysis would be incomplete and unreliable."
2014-07-18,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company, which seems to be Google since it's referenced in most of them. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet mentions Google researching its stock and suggesting alternatives like Excel or stocks. This could indicate some interest but not enough for a sell-off.
2. The second tweet talks about futures rising despite negative news from Malaysia and GAZA. This could lead to more investors selling, which might be positive.
3. The third tweet is about a research on AMD money. This might show some interest in AMD's stock, which could affect Google if they have strategic relationships or partnerships.
4. The fourth tweet refers to a buy action for MBI and stocks. More buys can increase demand but may also depend on other factors like competition.
5. The fifth tweet says futures are flat because Malaysia's jet crash is causing tensions. This could lead to uncertainty, which might impact investor sentiment positively by making them hold off on buying.
6. The sixth tweet mentions the stock rebounding after losses. A recovery can sometimes boost a stock price but may depend on other factors like economic conditions or industry trends.
7. The seventh tweet says Microsoft is leaving Android phones. This could cause competition, reducing Google's options and potentially lowering prices for customers who buy both, which might lower demand and thus the stock price negatively.
8. The eighth tweet mentions Google shutting down Android devices due to a negative sentiment towards AI. Negative news about competitors can harm a company, leading to increased negatives on their stock.
9. The ninth tweet talks about Nissan ramping up self-driving vehicles. This could attract more investors interested in electric vehicles, which are often competitive with Google, affecting the stock price positively but also risking competition from other companies like Tesla or Waymo.
10. The tenth tweet lists a mix of stock prices for different companies. This is speculative and doesn't provide immediate information about Google's performance, so it might not have a clear impact yet.
11. The eleventh tweet mentions Google's BOSS (a user) leaving softbank. A significant departure in leadership can affect investor sentiment, especially if it leads to higher risks or doubts, which could be positive for potential buyers but negative for existing ones.
12. The twelfth tweet has a mix of actions by users. It might imply that multiple factors are influencing investor decisions, making it hard to predict the stock's movement.
13. The thirteenth tweet says Google is rising despite mixed Q2 results. This suggests some confidence and growth potential, which could be positive for the stock price.
14. The fourteenth tweet advises selling ACM, ADP, EXR stocks. If other investors are doing this, it might cause a sell-off, which can negatively impact Google's price.
15. The fifteenth tweet is similar to the fourth one, advising to sell AMZN and GM. Similar reasoning as tweet 14, leading to potential selling pressure on Google's stock.
16. The sixteenth tweet gives an update on Google's mobile ad business and mentions a mention of Google in another tweet, suggesting continued news about their business areas.

Putting it all together, the tweets show some positive developments like revenue growth, mixed results, strategic partnerships, but also significant negative factors like competition from competitors, leadership departures, and stock price fluctuations. The overall sentiment seems to be mixed, with both support for the company (like product launches or partnerships) and concerns about broader market issues."
2014-07-19,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for Goog. 

First, I'll go through each tweet one by one and break them down into factors. Starting with the first tweet: ""$ pg considering investing in $ zts $ mu $ goog stockmarket URL."" The positive factor here is Goog being a leading tech company, but the negative factor is the mention of ""mu"" which doesn't seem relevant. 

Next, the second tweet mentions hot stocks to watch on $ goog - u . s . hot stocks : hot stocks to watch URL. This also presents Goog as a top stock, so positive. The negative aspect isn't too clear here.

The third tweet lists various S&P 500 companies related to Goog like $ googl, $ gme, etc., which is another positive factor because it indicates interest in different sectors of Goog. But I don't see any explicit negative information from this one.

Looking at the fourth tweet: ""$ osk awesome stock research $ aos $ stz $ goog financial URL."" This seems to mention other stocks like AOSK, STZ, GOOG, etc., so positive factors again about Goog and others being relevant. Negative isn't present here either.

Fifth tweet is a newsletter about IFs and NCLH, mentioningGOOGL investing. Positive because it's related to another company (IF) which doesn't tie back to Goog. But I don't see negative info there.

Sixth tweet suggests buying TSO, HCN, SM, GOOG research. Again, positive as it's about other stocks including Goog. Negative seems negligible here.

The seventh tweet keeps an eye on FLR and JBHT. While this shows interest in different companies unrelated to Goog directly, no negative information is given that could affect Goog stock. So, maybe slight positive for diversification but nothing concrete.

Eighth tweet mentions TAP, PGR, HPQ related to GOOG. Positive because it's about the company itself. Negative isn't present here either.

Ninth tweet provides info on APOL and ZNGA. This seems like technical analysis rather than investment advice, so maybe no direct impact on stock price, but I don't have a strong opinion on that side.

Tenth tweet is a break-out call for SEIC, ITC, GOOG clicking. Positive because it's a potential signal to buy. Negative might be about the stock market's overall performance, which isn't explicitly mentioned here.

Eleventh tweet suggests selling RF and CNH related to GOOG research. Again, positive for diversification but no clear negative information affecting Goog itself.

Putting it all together, each tweet either supports Goog as a potential investment or provides related information. There aren't any tweets that are negative about Goog stock directly. So, I don't think the overall sentiment is neutral. It seems like there's a mix of positive mentions and some technical info, but nothing overly negative.

I'm leaning towards a [Positive] because all the relevant posts support Goog or other stocks that could be related to it. But since one tweet might have been misread as a negative (like the sixth one which suggests buying GOOG), I should consider if there are any nuances here. However, I don't see a strong enough negative factor influencing the sentiment."
2014-07-20,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet mentions investing in DDR, TW, JZIX, and GOOG with a rate_limit_exceeded tag. That seems like it's setting some kind of investment strategy or warning about something related to GOOG. Maybe it's a signal that the market is bullish or bearish on GOOG.

2. The second tweet talks about insider trading updates on FBT, JNJ, and GOOG, and mentions looking at URL. Insider trading can sometimes indicate increased activity or potential risks, so this might influence investor sentiment positively.

3. The third tweet lists hottest stocks on social media: FB, GOOG, SPY, and AAPL. Positive stock picks usually boost market confidence, which could be a good sign for the company's future performance.

4. The fourth tweet mentions BRK, looking to sellgoog, WTM, YOD, and overvalued URLs. Selling something can sometimes send shockwaves if the stock is overpriced, affecting investor sentiment.

5. The fifth tweet suggests holding stocks like MCD, SK, CBT, and GOOG for winners. This might mean that the market is expecting some undervaluation or good news, so it could be a positive indicator.

6. The sixth tweet questions whether to hold TKR, UP, WAG, and goog wealthmanagement. Uncertainty in investment decisions can sometimes create confusion, which might not directly impact stock price but can affect investor behavior.

7. The seventh tweet is research on UNM, AN, SJM, and GOOG on WILWALL. Similar to others, this could be a way for the company to share information that's expected, affecting market expectations.

8. Eight tweets are all bullish on clr, VRSK, BOH, and GOOG in a ""money"" tag. More positive language about investments can build confidence in the stock price.

9. The ninth tweet is about holding OKE stocks with research on INTC, KSU, GOOG. This seems like traditional investment strategy, which could be reinforcing current market trends.

10. The tenth tweet mentions viewing stock reports on GOOG, FTL, PCLN, and NASDAQ. Market research can provide insights into future performance or industry trends, so this might influence investors positively.

11. The eleventh tweet suggests watching some stocks with DEX, CRi, GOOG. Similar to others, this is about market analysis and could be a good sign for the company's future.

12. The twelfth tweet is about TFX stock research on AVX, VMW, GOOG. Market analysis can give insights into potential trends or risks related to GOOG.

Putting it all together, each tweet seems to provide information that could positively impact the stock price by signaling investment activity, trends, and market sentiment. There's a mix of buys, suggests holding, overvalued signals, and strategic investments, but overall, they seem to be reinforcing investor confidence or highlighting favorable aspects for the company."
2014-07-21,Positive,"Okay, I'm trying to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the company. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the tweets, I can see that some mention "" goog "", others talk about other stocks like $ ppg or $ msi. Since the user didn't specify which stock, maybe they want a general assessment based on the keywords. 

Each tweet is analyzed individually for positive and negative factors. For example, tweet 1 mentions big players grabbing window seats, which could be seen as a positive sign for the stock. But I also notice that some tweets mention "" goog "", suggesting that this particular stock might be performing well. 

Then, each tweet is evaluated on sentiment. If many positive factors are present and they align with the stock's performance, it leans towards positive. However, if negative factors dominate or there's a mix of emotions, it might be neutral. 

Looking at all the tweets together, I see mentions like "" goog "", "" mercedes f1 team"", "" bre it could break tout time"", etc., which are indicators that this stock is being seen as good investment. The presence of "" goog "" in several tweets suggests a general favorable outlook on the company's stock.

Combining these observations, there seems to be a positive trend, so I should conclude with [Positive]."
2014-07-22,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the company based on the provided information.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking through the tweets:

1. ""sig are you hanging on to $ aiv $ now $ goog singedinvestor URL"" – Hmm, this one seems to mention something about the AI stock, which is 'aiv'. The word 'singi' might be a typo or irrelevant here.
2. ""gain from movement in these buzzing assets dow jones $ goog usdjpy audusd eurusd url"" – This tweet talks about Dow Jones gains and mentions specific currency pairs with 'goog'.
3. ""get research on $ m $ payx $ zmh $ goog newsletter rate_limit_exceeded"" – Here, I see the stock symbol is 'goog', so this is the target.
4. "" $ vrsn small-cap stocks making 52 - wk highs $ cat $ lii $ goog nasdaq url"" – Again, 'goog' is mentioned here.
5. ""get great research on stocks $ mtd $ tmk $ ugi $ goog personalfinance url"" – This tweet includes 'goog'.
6. "" $ v bearish or bullish on these stocks $ rok $ voya $ goog view now url"" – 'goog' is present again.
7. "" $ pep here are some stocks to watch $ mhfi $ mon $ goog visit url"" – 'goog' is mentioned too.
8. "" $ goog : as global risk rises , companies rethink centralized it url"" – This tweet includes the stock symbol.
9. "" $ agco are you considering selling $ grpn $ mlm $ goog nse url"" – 'goog' is in here.

Okay, so the target stocks involved are: aiv, goog, usdjpy, eurusd, nasdaq, mtd, tmk, ugi, cat, lii, nasdaq, mhfi, mon, pep, agco. But some of these don't seem to be companies I know much about, so maybe their performance isn't a big factor here.

Now, analyzing each tweet for positive or negative factors:

1. ""I'm not sure about this one."" – Probably neutral because it's unclear.
2. Talks about Dow Jones and specific currency movements with ' goog'. Positive info but ambiguous.
3. Mentions a newsletter that might affect the stock. Neutral if no clear sentiment yet.
4. Indicates small-cap stocks are making 52-week highs. This is generally positive for investors, so likely positive sentiment from readers.
5. Lists research on ' mtd ', ' tmk ', and ' ugi ', but not specifically about ' goog'. So neutral as other topics mentioned.
6. Discusses bullish or bearish on ' goog ' with ""view now"". It's a bit unclear without context on the reader's feelings, so maybe neutral.
7. Mentions several stocks including ' goog ' to watch. Neutral because it's not about one company.
8. Talks about global risk and centralized companies reconsidering their operations. This is generally negative for investors as they might see increased costs or competition. So this tweet is probably negative.

Now, summarizing each tweet's sentiment:

1. Neutral
2. Positive but ambiguous
3. Neutral
4. Positive
5. Neutral
6. Unclear
7. Neutral
8. Negative

However, the overall impact would depend on how these factors contribute to the stock price. While some tweets are positive like ' goog making 52-week highs' or negative like the risk reconsideration, without knowing more about each factor, it's hard to sum up the overall sentiment as a single word.

But looking at tweet 8, it's definitely negative regarding global risks and centralized companies. The other tweets have some mixed signals but can be considered neutral except for tweet 4 which is pretty positive. So the strongest indicator here might be tweet 8, making the overall sentiment Negative."
2014-07-23,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how the given tweets impact the stock price of a company based on the information provided. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. It seems like several tweets mention ""goog,"" so that must be the stock we're focusing on: Google Inc.

Now, looking at each tweet individually, they all include mentions of ""goog"" in various ways. My first thought is to parse whether there's a positive or negative indication for Google. However, some tweets are more about general sentiments rather than directly mentioning the stock itself. 

For example, tweet 6 talks about traders checking out indexpro and picks the best S&P 500 stocks, which might influence investor sentiment positively if they think it's a good buy. But others like tweets 4 mention ""bullish on these stocks"" or even specific companies like alb and live. These can add weight to the bullish aspect.

On the other hand, some tweets are more about potential actions—buying or selling options on Google stock. This might indicate investor interest in the stock but not necessarily a clear positive or negative signal yet.

However, considering tweet 10, where someone is thinking of selling EXR and K, this could be part of their strategy or perspective on Google's performance. Similarly, tweets 3 and 9 provide more context about global smartphone sales affecting Google's valuation, which might influence investor confidence but not necessarily the stock price directly.

Even though some tweets signal optimism towards Google (like tweet 4), others suggest uncertainty or cautiousness (like tweet 1). The overall impact seems mixed, with some positive factors pointing towards a bullish market and others hinting at uncertainty. 

Given that some tweets are more about broader trends or sentiment indicators than concrete mentions of the stock itself, I'm leaning towards a neutral stance. There's enough positivity to support the idea but also signs suggesting investors might be cautious."
2014-07-24,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze each tweet and determine their impact on the company's stock price. Let me go through each one step by step.

1. The first tweet mentions all major stocks today but doesn't specify how it affects the company.
2. The second tweet talks about patent applications related to receptacles, which might be a technological topic affecting their performance.
3. Third tweet focuses on research related to QGEN and other companies, so it's likely discussing their stock performance.
4. Fourth tweet discusses bandwidth issues affecting S&P 500, NFLX, SPX, SPXPM, etc., so it's a technical note impacting their valuation.
5. Fifth tweet is about moving towards research on OSK, ATI, PG, and goog; maybe they're evaluating their strategies or stock performance.
6.第六条提到 insider trading updates, which can be bad for investor confidence and might affect the stock price negatively.
7. 第七条讨论了 Breakout time potential on CREE, CAR, ETN,goog liquidity. This could indicate future earnings growth, which is positive.
8.第八条提到 Q2 earnings release, so it's about upcoming financial data that affects current stock performance.
9. 第九条关于寻找更赚钱的股票，建议关注欧米茄和通用电气等，这可能 encourage them to buy stocks they think will perform well.
10. 第十一条是Google jogging memories meant to be forgotten; this seems unrelated, could be a positive sign for their reputation or market image.
11. 评论提到Google jogged memories meant to be forgotten and saw watchdogs mention it. This is speculative but might imply good news.
12. 检查了股票，建议关注 VNO、BTOU、CVI、 goog，并提供链接。这可能吸引投资者的注意。
13. 关注Google jogging headline; if positive, it could be a sign of good developments that boost the stock price.
14. 建议卖出PPE和GPS股票，比如PCG、GOOG，这可能是在寻找长期增长股，所以可能不利。
15. 评论指出Google Bullish on these stocks and look for value. This is encouraging, suggesting strong future performance.
16. Google grants over half of their 'right to be forgotten' requests. More public awareness about corporate governance could affect investor confidence positively.
17. 这条提到Google granted requests; more transparency might improve the stock's perception, leading to a positive impact.
18. 本周关注科技股，如WU、HTS、OGE和 goog。如果预计这些股会表现不错，可能积极影响股价。
19. Google seeking next hot semiconductor stock like NLSH and NLSN; encouraging innovation could boost the company's performance.
20. 建议购买CBS、KORS、LYB股票，并提供链接，吸引投资者注意，这可能是正面信号。
21. 关注Google动向，如果他们计划退出FB，可能会影响股价。
22. 评论提到10个独特信息，但不确定这些信息是否有助于预测股价，暂时不太确定。
23. 这条指出科技公司中性男性的背景，但具体对公司的影响不明确。
24. 提供更多关于NYCB、TSS、STJ的信息，可能吸引投资者兴趣，但不确定是否有正面影响。
25. 评论提到BBC的更多信息，不确定是否有积极信号。

Now, I'll summarize the overall sentiment by combining these factors. Positive tweets include QGEN, SPX, etc., which might boost股价. Neutral includes the mention of insider trading but not necessarily negative. Negative might come from less clear or speculative comments like the v.etal sunshine headline, and a potential warning about a watchdog comment on Facebook.

Overall, there are mixed signals with some positive aspects like good news and earnings, moderate negative due to potential warnings. The stock might be in a gray area."
2014-07-25,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price. First, I need to identify the target stock for each tweet. It seems like a lot of them mention ""goog,"" so that's probably the company we're looking at.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one. For each tweet, I should separate the factors—whether it's positive or negative—and assess the sentiment based on what's mentioned. Let me jot down my thoughts as I go along to see if I can identify any trends or overall patterns.

Starting with tweet 1: ""mos are you bullish on these stocks axp adt goog equity url."" It says ""bullish"" but doesn't specify how. I'll note that it's positive but vague enough to determine the next level, so maybe [Positive].

Tweet 2 mentions Google's stock reports, which is a common topic. These can affect investor sentiment, so this could be neutral or slightly positive.

Tweet 3 talks about finding more winners like TCO and Tw $ Goo with clicks. It sounds like a business plan, so it might be positive but not extremely strong yet.

Tweet 4 asks for stock research on Google's financials. This is definitely something investors would want to know, which could push sentiment towards [Positive].

tweet 5: ""would you like great research on stocks ctl ocr byi goog financialnews url."" Again, it's prompting research, so I'll consider this as [Positive] because it indicates interest in the stock.

Tweet 6 is about zts, ace, dre, goog being overvalued. Over valuing stocks can sometimes be seen as a signal for potential downturns or opportunities, but without more context, it's hard to tell—maybe neutral?

tweet 7: ""man seeking the next stock like data mgm goog i suggest."" This seems promotional and could indicate strong sentiment.

tweet 8 talks about watching today's stocks like Alkox, Regn, Xlnx with goog. It's a call for action, so [Positive] makes sense here.

tweet 9 mentions pfe, car, etn stock rates. Stock rate limits can affect investor sentiment and could be considered [Neutral].

tweet 10: ""stock market reports on stocks like pfe car etn goog rate limit exceeded."" Again, this is about market reports, which could be neutral but might indicate potential for more attention.

tweet 11: ""don't be left behind nvr asna gra money management url."" This is a warning to stay updated, so it's probably [Negative] because it's proactive in seeking information.

tweet 12: ""movers to research vrsn hsic ffiv goog view now."" Similar to tweet 7 and 8, it seems promotional and could be [Positive].

tweet 13: ""bxp are you hanging on to dvn mon financial url."" This is a call for stock performance, so another indication of [Positive].

tweet 14: ""is it breakout time on els wr mgm goog equity url."" Breakout times are often positive signals, so I'll mark this as [Positive].

tweet 15: ""get more info on ulta alr jcp goog click url."" More information is always a good thing for investors; so another [Positive].

tweet 16: ""rt user wsj story on goog's baseline product. genomics study hunting new biomarkers."" This story could provide valuable information, which would push sentiment towards [Positive].

tweet 17: ""are you looking to buy nvr rk hma wealth management url."" Buying a stock is a direct action, so definitely positive.

tweet 18: ""goog facebook makes zuckerberg wealthier than google guys. link missing."" This seems like a comparison of company sizes and might be seen as an indicator of growth potential; [Positive].

tweet 19: ""are you bullish on these stocks arw dd sna goog view now url."" Promotional call for research, so [Positive].

tweet 20: ""lh are you thinking of selling mo dnb goog view now url."" Selling stocks is a negative action because it reduces investment; so [Negative].

tweet 21: ""goog amazon google cloud price war benefits cios -> url. stock stocks actions."" This seems like an offer for action, which would be [Positive].

tweet 22: ""alxn get latest on pcl cxo goog research url."" Promotional to seek info, so [Positive].

tweet 23: ""pii holds onto n hsh google's worth view now url."" More information about stock holdings could influence sentiment; perhaps [Positive].

tweet 24: ""rt user confirmed goog acquires online video streaming platform for gaming at $1b url. link missing."" This sounds like a news event that can impact the stock, so [Positive].

tweet 25: ""buy dnax dna energy drinks new ceo real experience > fnma hemp pmcm phot plpl cbis jpm gs ms tsla fb twtr goog msft url."" Promotional for action and information, so [Positive].

tweet 26: ""look for next winners like fcs gwr boh goog nse url."" Promotional to seek info or find opportunities; maybe [Positive].

Looking through all these, some tweets are very positive (Most), but a few have more uncertainty or speculative elements. The overall sentiment seems mixed with strong [Positive] and occasional [Negative]. I think the overall impact is [Neutral] because while there's some positive news, there are also warnings or speculative offers that could counteract some of the positive feelings."
2014-07-26,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price for the given company. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Both tweets mention ""goog,"" so that must be Google Inc., which has the ticker symbol ""GOOGL.""

Now, moving on to the first tweet: ""$ goog is set to run a genetic and molecular study on what makes a human healthy URL."" This sounds like a strategic business move. A company setting up such a study could potentially lead to increased revenue by expanding their research capabilities. So, this seems positive.

Next, the second tweet says ""google grants over half of ' right to be forgotten ' requests processed so far $ goog URL via AT_USER."" This line mentions Google processing URLs for other users. Processing user requests can be both a revenue boost and potentially lead to more traffic, which is also positive. It's an indication that Google's services are getting more attention from their customers.

Looking at the output requirement, I need to combine these factors into an overall sentiment summary using [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Both tweets express enthusiasm for Google's future growth and strategic initiatives, so the stock price is expected to rise."
2014-07-27,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided two tweets about Apple Inc. and I need to determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""Goo $ goog - proof that apple , inc . is investing in innovation -> URL stock stocks stockaction."" Hmm, this seems a bit confusing. It mentions Goo as the symbol for Apple's stock and talks about investing in innovation. I'm not entirely sure what the user meant by ""proof"" here. Maybe it's indicating that the user believes Apple is innovative.

Now, the second tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ 61,200 , 000,000 cash — $ goog URL."" This one seems to be addressing user money and stock prices. The mention of $61.2 million in cash suggests a positive note regarding financial stability or funding. However, the wording is a bit unclear: ""rt AT_USER $ 61,200 , 000,000 cash — $ goog URL"" might be read as the user has $61.2 million in cash, which could indicate financial strength.

Considering both tweets together, Apple seems to be investing in innovation and is perceived to have a significant amount of cash on hand. These positive points from each tweet would likely lead investors to view Apple positively regarding future stock performance."
2014-07-28,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of Google. The user provided some tweets, and I have to decide if each is positive, neutral, or negative in terms of affecting the stock. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the process involves identifying the target stock symbol, which isn't directly given here. But looking at the tweets, I see mentions like $ goog, fb, twtr, etc., so Google seems to be the target. 

Now, looking at each tweet:

1. ""google’s acquisitions spree expected to continue - google ($ goog ) URL."" This sounds positive because it's talking about continued growth through acquisitions. People might expect more expansion into other companies, which can boost stock prices.

2. The next tweets are all repeating ""$ rgse swing trade alert . price target 3 then 3.50 $ fb $ twtr..."" There are multiple mentions of stocks like fb, twtr, goog, etc., and they mention ""price target."" So this is likely a warning that the stock might be aiming for higher prices, which could indicate positive sentiment.

3. The same tweet repeats again with more details about potential price targets. It's talking about trading information and suggesting it's important for traders to know. This could mean investors are cautious but expecting some increase in stock value.

4. Again, repeating the same message with slight variations. It reinforces the idea that they're watching the market closely, which might be positive for investors.

5. ""google online stock traders get their trading information here - no login required."" This seems neutral because it's a general statement about trading without requiring any login. There's no specific positive or negative information here, so it's probably not affecting the stock price much.

6. "". AT_USER wrong . last i checked $ amzn / $ goog / $ msft capex was at all time highs and they were driving vendor r & d in the hardware market."" This seems like a warning about potential changes in capex (capital expenditures) being high again, possibly affecting the company's operations. It could lead to increased costs or different strategies, which might lower the stock price if it's expected to affect profitability.

Putting this together: The first tweet is positive due to continued acquisitions. The subsequent tweets are also positive with a focus on potential price targets and capex changes. However, the fifth tweet isn't about stock info but general trading advice, which is neutral. The sixth tweet adds another negative point regarding potential changes in R&D costs.

So overall, there's more positive sentiment from the first five tweets and some mixed negatives. But I think the positive aspects dominate. Therefore, the overall sentiment should be Positive."
2014-07-29,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of the company. Let me take it step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: $ goog : pedophiles nabbed as banks join cops to follow the money trail URL. So, the target is probably Google Inc., with the symbol Google.

Now, I'll go through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions that pedophiles were nabbed and banks are joining cops to follow the money trail. That sounds like something related to the company's security or safety issues, which could lead investors to worry about their stock price. I think this is a Negative factor because if there are concerns, it might affect investor sentiment negatively.

2. The second tweet says $ goog - Google has an android app with a fake ID problem. This definitely relates to how users report their accounts on Google, which can impact the company's reputation and user trust. So that's another Negative factor.

3. The third tweet is about Microsoft investors' patience wearing thin due to regulators probing them amid U.S. tension. This suggests that the investment community is divided or uncertain about Microsoft's prospects, leading to concern. That's definitely a Negative sentiment affecting investor views.

4. The fourth tweet mentions that someone on Twitter responded to AT_USER about why Facebook is swimming in money and $ goog URL. I'm not sure what this refers to—maybe it's unrelated or another typo. But considering the context around it might influence investor sentiment, but since it's unclear, maybe it's a Neutral or Positive factor.

5. The fifth tweet talks about Microsoft being probed by regulators in China amid U.S. tension. This is similar to Twitter's previous statement, indicating a potential issue that could impact investor confidence and thus affect the stock price negatively.

Putting it all together: All tweets from Google seem to suggest concerns about security, account management issues, and regulatory scrutiny. These factors are significant enough to potentially drag down the stock price, especially if investors perceive these issues as material. So, I'm leaning towards a Negative overall sentiment."
2014-07-30,Neutral,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to conclude the review for ""An Unthinking Computer."" The user provided a list of reviews from 38 customers, and each customer is either ""Unthinking"" or ""Unthinking Computers."" 

First, looking at what each category says. All the ""Unthinking"" customers are very happy. They mention that the computers work perfectly, which makes sense since they're called ""unthinking,"" implying they don't require repairs and are reliable. The positive reviews cover all areas like performance, speed, durability, and features.

Now, looking at the other 42 reviews from 43 to 74: these seem more skeptical. People mention that unthinking computers pull off clever tricks, which makes me think they're not just good but maybe overzealous or overly optimistic. Some customers are even questioning if they're real because of these tricks. Others are critical about how the computer seems too powerful and that it's pulling out impressive stuff without proper grounding.

The last set from 75 onwards includes customer reviews where people are clearly skeptical about the company or their product beyond a doubt. They might be concerned about safety, reliability, or the product's value compared to what they expected.

Putting this together, I need to decide whether the overall sentiment is positive, neutral, or negative. The majority of the 80 reviews are from ""Unthinking"" customers who are happy and confident in their products. However, there are some clearly skeptical voices, especially in the latter half of the list. These skeptical voices might indicate that while many people like the product, a small segment is not as positive.

Considering the examples given, when others are unsure or critical, it leans towards negative sentiment. The positive reviews from ""Unthinking"" support the idea that despite some skepticism elsewhere, the overall experience is generally good and encouraging.

So, I think the overall sentiment should be [Neutral] because there's both a strong majority of positive feedback and some critical opinions that balance each other out."
2014-07-31,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze the given tweets to determine their likely impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided 22 tweets and wants me to extract key information, separate positive and negative factors, assess sentiment, and then conclude the overall effect.

First, looking at tweet 1: It's just an introduction with several links and mentions of companies like FB, LOKI, TSLA, GOOG, AAPL, MFLD. No action here, so I don't see any selling or buying intent yet.

Tweets 2 to 5 are also all introductory, similar to tweet 1. They mention technical analyses but no specific actions like buying or selling stock. So maybe nothing happens here yet.

Tweets 6 and 7 repeat the same content as tweets 2-5, just repeating the same analysis without action.

Tweets 8 is another introduction, not offering any immediate action either.

Then comes tweet 9 again with similar stuff. No specific action taken by AT_USER. So far, no buying or selling mentioned.

Tweets 10 introduces a thought where Google might buy Yelp for a buyout targeting the NYSE. This could be positive because it's an announcement of potential expansion into new markets, which can attract investors and increase demand. The mention of a +PPS (presumably price per share) suggests potential benefits.

Tweets 11 to 22 are all about Alibaba competing with Google for startups' attention on Twitter. This is more about a strategic move rather than an action towards the stock price. It's a market competition scenario, not related to the target company yet.

So putting it together: There are 7 tweets introducing but no immediate selling or buying actions. The only significant announcement is tweet 10, where Google plans a buyout for Yelp with a potential PPS increase. This could be seen as positive news about expansion and market reach, which might positively impact the stock price."
2014-08-01,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on a company's stock price. The user provided a list of 22 tweets, but it looks like some are duplicates or just rehashing the same information. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. It seems consistent that "" goog "" is mentioned multiple times, so I think that's the company's ticker symbol: Google. That makes sense because ""goog"" is a common abbreviation for the internet giant.

Next, I'll separate the factors into positive and negative based on the tweets. For each tweet, I notice there are mentions of Google's performance or changes, like shipments, stock prices, etc. Each tweet talks about either improving or declining aspects of Google's performance relative to global shipments or other metrics.

Looking at some tweets: ""rt AT_USER smartphones running android accounted for 85 % of global shipments in 2q . apple's fell to 11.9 % . URL $ goog $ aapl"" Here, Google is mentioned as the target stock (goog), and it points out that global shipments went up by 85%, while Apple's performance dropped significantly. This could affect investor sentiment because if they think there are more shipments, especially from Apple, it might look good for Google.

Another tweet: ""rt AT_USER most visited website by country - tech $ goog $ fb baidu rt AT_USER URL"" Here, the focus is on how a company's website ranking affects its stock. If people find their site better than others, that could be a positive sign for investors, but if they think it's not great, it might turn negative.

I see some tweets talking about stock performance and changes in prices. For example, ""rt AT_USER my take on mobileye before its ipo launches tomorrow : URL $ mbly $ tsla $ goog driverlesscars investing …"" It seems like investors are looking ahead to a future event (tech's IPO) and have some expectations regarding Google.

Some tweets discuss stock research or trading info. For instance, ""rt AT_USER my take on mobileye before its ipo launches tomorrow : URL $ mbly $ tsla $ goog driverlesscars investing …"" Again, similar to the previous one, investors are speculating about future events and how it might affect their stocks.

There are a few mentions of Google's stock performance, like ""rt AT_USER google inc . ( aapl ) about to lay out google inc ( goog ) , samsung URL URL."" This looks like a potential announcement or partnership that could impact the company's financials. It might either boost or create tension depending on what's announced next.

I'm noticing that many tweets are redundant, just reiterating the same points. That suggests a steady flow of information without much change, which usually indicates a consistent view among investors.

Considering all these factors— shipments data, stock rankings, future events— it seems like Google is expected to perform well in various metrics related to shipments and their products. If the overall sentiment across these tweets is positive, especially regarding current performance and upcoming expectations, that could be favorable for the stock price.

However, there's no indication of any major news affecting Google negatively. The focus is on positive developments and future outlooks. But sometimes, even positive news can lead to selling pressure or increased risk-taking in stocks, which might not necessarily make it negative overall.

I'm leaning towards a Neutral sentiment because all the tweets are providing information without contradicting each other. They're about the company's performance in different areas but don't present any clear positive or negative trends. The data seems reliable and consistent across multiple sources, so the impact is more about confirming current views rather than changing them."
2014-08-02,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to figure out their impact on the stock price of the given company. The user has provided 10 tweets, and each tweet is a potential factor that might influence investor sentiment towards the stock. Let me go through each one step by step.

First, I should identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at them, most of them mention ""goog"" or other companies like ""apple"", ""google"", etc., so it's likely we're talking about Google's stock. So the target is [GOOG].

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. Then assess the sentiment by evaluating how these factors might influence investor sentiment.

Let me go through each tweet one by one.

1. ""Earnings news on $ rnr $ cme $ acm $ goog investing URL"" – This looks like an earnings report or financial announcement. Positive because it's about company performance and future prospects. Negative? Maybe not, but I'm leaning towards positive because earnings usually signal growth.

2. ""$ lm best research on stocks such s $ aiv $ scco $ goog nasdaq URL"" – Again, another announcement about stock research. This is positive as it can influence investor confidence.

3. ""rt AT_USER google cada vez más rico rt AT_USER $ 61,200 , 000,000 cash — $ goog URL"" – The user is praising Google's growth and providing a lot of cash. Positive because this could attract investors looking for investment opportunities or growth.

4. ""dennyt : mo morningstar $ mo $ goog $ bgeix $ eog $ stz URL"" – This seems to be an update from Morningstar about the stock. The user is optimistic (mo), so positive sentiment. Maybe more than just research; it's a broad update, which can boost investor confidence.

5. "". AT_USER right , $ goog will have the only fully autonomous car . its product will be more useful ."" – This tweet suggests that Google will release a product with a fully autonomous car, which could be a strategic move for their future products and market position. Positive because this could open up new opportunities and improve market presence.

6. ""inside trading updates on $ avx $ anss $ ftr $ goog financialnews URL"" – This is about insider trading news. The user is concerned about potential insider trading, which can be a negative factor if it leads to price volatility or stock manipulation issues. So negative sentiment here.

7. ""are you investing in $ hme $ bwc $ hcp $ goog stock URL"" – The tweet is asking for investment advice. This can create buzz among investors looking to capitalize on this offer, which would be positive because it attracts more attention and potential buyers.

8. ""$ stocks you might want to buy $ m $ idxx $ goog $ slv investing URL"" – Similar to tweet 7, this is a call for action from the user about buying certain stocks. This can drive demand as investors rush to secure their investments before the price drops too low, which could be positive.

9. ""rt AT_USER smartphones running android accounted for 85 % of global shipments in 2q . apple's fell to 11.9 %."" – The tweet is comparing smartphone shipments with Apple's performance. While this might seem like a negative point if it affects competitors or market dynamics, maybe Google can benefit from improved tech adoption. So mixed sentiment because there are two possible angles: positive impact on the company and negative for the competition.

10. ""$ lm it could be breakout time on $ rok $ lpnt $ goog research URL"" – This suggests that there's a potential upcoming research or report that might cause a market breakout, possibly leading to significant gains. Positive because it looks like an upcoming event could drive stock price up.

Now, compiling the sentiment from each tweet:

1. Positive
2. Positive
3. Positive
4. Positive (as Morningstar updates are generally considered positive by investors)
5. Positive (autonomous car is a good growth area)
6. Negative (insider trading concerns can be negative but might have mixed impact in reality)
7. Positive (call for investment, which can attract buyers and drive demand)
8. Positive (call to buy stocks, which directly attracts buyers)
9. Mixed, leaning towards positive if the tech comparison shows Google's position improving
10. Positive

Overall sentiment is a mix of positive factors but with some negative aspects, especially tweet 6 about insider trading.

Wait, I'm not sure how to handle the negative tweet. Should I consider it as negative or neutral? If investors are concerned about insider trading, that could lead to a negative sentiment because it can affect investor confidence and potentially disrupt the stock price. However, sometimes such concerns might be balanced by positive signals like improved performance or growth potential.

So, considering all factors: 9 positive tweets and one negative tweet (tweet 6). The others are mostly positive in their own right. So overall sentiment is mixed but leans slightly positive because some negative points add to the positives."
2014-08-03,Neutral,"Alright, let's try to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the company. 

First, I need to identify each tweet and note down what they're suggesting regarding the company. Starting with tweet 1: it says ""are you bullish on these stocks ov pdm fls goog view now url."" That sounds like they're offering investment advice, so that's a positive sign.

Tweet 2 mentions stock research but doesn't specify whether to watch or not, which is neutral because we don't have direct information about the company. 

Tweet 3 talks about android vulnerabilities and thinks they still pose a threat after two years. This could be seen as a negative outlook since it warns of security risks, affecting investor confidence.

Tweet 4 suggests looking for cah, avb, pbct, goog wealth management. Again, without knowing what these are, this is speculative—neutral.

Tweet 5 is about an easy options strategy video and testing stocks from Friday. If the user tested stocks, it might indicate they're serious and may be bullish on the stock performance.

Tweet 6 talks about stock research by slg, mdlz, dnkn, goog, but not specifying the company or action—neutral info.

Tweet 7 is about emn researching atk, gnc, goog for value. Similar to tweet 4, this could mean potential positive news if they see a break-out or significant move.

Tweet 8 suggests goog must see ggp it's breaking out on splk chtr. This direct mention of a possible break-out might indicate strong bullish sentiment.

Putting it all together: some tweets are offering advice (positive), others are vague about actions, and one clearly states a potential break-out. The mix of positive and negative signals makes the overall sentiment uncertain, so I think [Neutral] is appropriate."
2014-08-04,Positive,"Alright, let's analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of the given company. The tweet mentions Michael Kors as a bullish analyst with positive sentiments towards Michael Kors. He also supports big tech companies like Groupon and several others.

First, I notice that there are multiple positive tweets about Michael Kors, which could indicate confidence in his brand or strategic growth. However, when looking at the other tweets related to Groupon, it's clear they support a strong tech sector. These are all positive, especially regarding the tech stocks.

The sentiment seems consistent across relevant tweets—positive for technology and Michael Kors. I don't see any negative or neutral indicators here. The focus is on growth, innovation, and brand reputation in the tech space. 

Considering the context of investing in a company, a strong and consistent positive sentiment towards multiple sectors suggests investor confidence is rising. This could lead to an upward trend in stock price as investors view the company's prospects favorably."

2014-08-06,Missing,File not found
2014-08-07,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First tweet: AT_USER would be buying back shares from AT_USER $ grpn because they're involved in a deal with Google. This seems like a buy-sell signal as the user is investing, so positive sentiment likely.

Second and third tweets mention Barnes & Noble teaming up to compete on Amazon's books business. That sounds like they might be collaborating which could be positive for the company, leading to some optimism about growth. So both tweets contribute positively.

Fourth tweet just mentions Google, Barnes & Noble joining to tackle Amazon. Without specifics, it's hard to tell, but the collaboration is a good sign, so this adds more positivity.

Fifth tweet talks about spammers rigging Google's search algorithm. This seems like bad news for Google, which would negatively affect its stock price and overall company performance. 

Putting it all together: most tweets are positive except for the last one which has negative implications. The overall sentiment is leaning towards positive because while there's a downside in tweet 5, the other tweets provide strong support.

I should conclude with [Positive] as the main impact."
2014-08-08,Negative,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether these tweets are positive, negative, or neutral in impact on the stock price of a company. Let me break down each step carefully.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER barnes & noble and google are teaming up to compete in amazon's original business – books . URL $ goog $ amzn $ bks"". Hmm, that looks like a typo. It mentions AT_USER, which doesn't seem familiar as a stock symbol. Maybe it's supposed to be something else, or perhaps it's a placeholder? The other tweets mention gdxj and others but don't specify the company name.

Wait, on closer look, the first tweet says ""teaming up to compete in amazon's original business – books."" That might not directly point to an obvious stock. Maybe there's another stock symbol here? Let me check the second tweet: ""$ gdxj ask URL also see : $ goog $ xle $ mcd ~"". Again, no obvious symbols. I'm confused about which stock these tweets are referring to.

Perhaps it's a typo or a mistake in the first tweet. Maybe the correct stock is something else? If I don't have the specific company name, it's hard to assess the impact on its stock price. Without knowing what the tweet is about, I can't determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.

Since I can't identify the target stock from these tweets, I need more information. Maybe they're referring to a known company? If not, I can't make an accurate prediction. So, in this case, without knowing which stock is being referred to by the tweets, I can't assess their impact on its price."
2014-08-09,Missing,File not found
2014-08-10,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price. So, I have two tweets here. 

First tweet: "" mine this won't be a penny stock come next week $ mine this won't be a penny stock come next week $ soda $ sbux $ twtr $ fb $ goog $ aapl $ loco $ tkmr $ nflx $ p $ siri URL""

Hmm, okay. The first part of the tweet seems to suggest that it's not going to be a penny stock for the next week. Penny stocks are those with low market capitalization or high volatility, so maybe this could mean something negative. Then there's mentions like ""soda,"" ""sbux"" (SBUX is a stock), ""twtr,"" ""fb,"" ""goog,"" etc., which are all technology-related companies. The presence of ""p"" and ""siri"" might refer to something else, perhaps related to Twitter or an account name.

Looking at the second tweet: "" predict on $ goog ( URL ' hong kong court says tycoon can sue google ' URL pwst URL""

This seems more about a legal aspect. The company Google is being sued by a tycoon in Hong Kong. That could be seen as negative news for investors because it affects the stock price indirectly through regulatory changes or potential fines.

Now, combining both tweets, I'm thinking there are two main factors influencing investor sentiment: one pointing to potential negative growth (penny stocks) and another about an impending legal battle (Google lawsuit). Both of these could impact the stock either positively or negatively. Since the first tweet is quite speculative and vague, it's hard to gauge its immediate effect. The second tweet provides a more concrete threat but might not sway opinions as much.

I'm leaning towards a neutral overall sentiment because while there are conflicting factors, they're both somewhat external and could have mixed effects. Investors might be cautious given the uncertainty from the penny stock outlook and the legal issue, leading to a balanced view without strong conviction in either direction."
2014-08-11,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the future stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First tweet: ""google ' c ' : tanzania : google , yahoo make phone numbers mandatory for new email ids URL $ goog $ yhoo"". Hmm, that seems like Google is involved in something with the 'c' symbol in Tanzania. The word 'phone numbers mandatory' might be a clue about their services or policies. I'm not sure how this affects their stock directly, but maybe it's about expansion into another country or product launch.

Second tweet: ""is it me or are the forex markets acting a little funky .. ? $ spy $ spx $ dia $ qqq $ iwm $ vxx $ gld $ aapl $ goog $ fb"". This looks like it could be referring to stock names. The 'spy' and others might represent different stocks. I'm not sure what ""forex markets"" are, so maybe they're just making fun of the markets in general. It's possible that this tweet is mocking or being sarcastic about the markets.

I need to assess each tweet individually first. For the first one, it seems like Google could be focusing on their operations in Tanzania, which might affect their revenue or growth. If they're making phone numbers mandatory, that could either boost or hurt them depending on context. But without more info, it's hard to tell.

The second tweet is a mix of股票 names and a joke about forex markets. Maybe the user is trying to mock the stock market in general. Fox News mentions ""forex markets,"" which I'm not familiar with, but maybe they're referencing something else entirely. The rest are probably unrelated stock symbols, so it's hard to see how this impacts the overall company.

I think both tweets seem to be either about Google or some unrelated topics. They don't directly mention their financial performance, revenue, or anything that would indicate a positive or negative trend. So I'm leaning towards them being neutral."
2014-08-12,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. The user provided two tweets and wants an analysis of their likely effects.

First, looking at tweet 1: ""rt AT_USER google is backing a $ 300mm trans-pacific cable URL $ goog"". This seems like it's from a follower account. The content mentions Google backing a specific project worth $300 million in cable infrastructure. It sounds like Google is supporting a major infrastructure project, which could indicate support for the company that has invested in such projects.

Now, tweet 2: ""$ goog : google to back undersea internet cable project worth URL URL"". Again, it's from the same user and seems to be from a Twitter account. This also mentions Google backing an undersea ( submarine ) internet cable project, which is a key component of their infrastructure. The fact that both tweets are highlighting Google's support for major cables suggests that this could positively influence investor confidence.

Considering both tweets focus on Google supporting significant projects related to the company, and since investors often look at how companies engage with tech companies through major investments in infrastructure or other ventures, these tweets likely show positive sentiment. Therefore, combining the two tweets indicates a positive impact on the stock price."
2014-08-13,Positive,"Okay, so I have to figure out the impact of these tweets on the future stock price of a company. The user provided three tweets and asked me to analyze them to determine if they'll be positive, neutral, or negative.

Let's take it step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""google initiated by stifel nicolaus at buy . $ 700.00 pt . URL $ goog goog."" Hmm, this seems off because Google's symbol is not listed here. Maybe it's a typo or misread. I'll note that and proceed.

Next tweet: ""$ grub making all-time highs . take-out rumors swirling ? $ amzn , $ goog seem like a good fit ."" This mentions Grubblot, which I know is a company known for its restaurants. It also talks about Take-out Rumors swirling around Amz and Google. The mention of ""all-time highs"" suggests they're looking for stocks that are rising. So, positive factors here.

Third tweet: ""stockgenie alets magical source of profits $ aeye $ cmgo $ goog & more ! followandprofit nasdaq makemoney stockaction stockmarket."" This one is a bit confusing. It mentions stockgenie, which I'm not familiar with, but the terms like ""magical source of profits"" and the other stocks suggest they're trying to attract investors or provide investment opportunities. The part about ""followandprofit"" and ""makemoney"" seems like potential promotional tactics, implying a positive outlook.

Now, for each tweet, I need to separate factors into positive and negative. For the first tweet, without knowing the stock symbol correctly, it's hard to analyze further, but maybe they're focusing on something else or perhaps a typo that needs clarification.

The second tweet has both positive (Grubblot and Take-out Rumors) and some vague terms which are good for analysis. The mention of all-time highs suggests an upward trend, so that's positive. Investors would want stocks to go up in value.

The third tweet is more about action-oriented investors or promotional tactics. It seems like they're trying to sell stockaction, which might indicate that the user thinks Amz and Google are undervalued and willing to sell for good money. This could be seen as a positive signal because it's selling stocks at a discount.

Putting this together: The second tweet is clear about Grubblot being all-time highs, so that's positive. The third tweet uses promotional tactics which might imply investors are buying up the stock for profit, contributing to positive sentiment. The first tweet without the stock symbol could be more of an unread tweet or a typo. 

So overall, considering the tweets are talking about trends, profits, and promotional selling, I think it's likely a positive impact on the stock price."
2014-08-14,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about the stock price for Google. 

First, I see four tweets provided. Each seems to be related to whether a potential employee at Yahoo is interested in buying Google or selling it back. The tweets mention ""rt AT_USER"" and talk about $1 million offers from Yahoo.

Looking at tweet 2 and 3, they're using the hashtag #InsiderTradingUpdates and asking about insider trading. Similarly, tweet 4 repeats these points again. I remember that insider trading can be a red flag for investments because it indicates potential manipulation or unethical behavior among investors.

Each of these tweets is likely from investors who are concerned about whether Yahoo might use this info to buy Google or sell it back. Investors typically react negatively when there's speculation around manipulating stock prices, which can affect the overall market and individual stocks.

So combining all these factors—whether it's insider trading, speculative behaviors by investors, or potential manipulation—it seems clear that the sentiment is negative for Google's future stock price."
2014-08-15,Neutral,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price of the company. Let me go through each tweet one by one and see if I can determine their impact.

Starting with the first tweet: ""umm dear AT_USER 30 sec ad in between every sub 30 sec clips ? idontthinkso epicfail $ goog cc : AT_USER"". It seems like this is a joke about AT_USER, which might be a typo or maybe they're just gaming the stock. The mention of $ goog and other terms doesn't indicate any positive or negative sentiment towards the company.

The second tweet: ""rt AT_USER in 1997 , yahoo turned down the offer to acquire google for only $ 1 million . today google is worth $360-410 billion . $ goog …"". This tweet discusses a past event where Yahoo offered $1 million for Google and now Google's value has increased significantly. It mentions the impact of that deal on investor sentiment, which suggests positive feelings about the company. So this tweet could be neutral or slightly positive.

The third tweet: ""$ pra insider trading updates on $ fisv $ goog give it a try URL"". This one is vague with some finance-related terms and links. There's no direct mention of positive or negative information affecting Google's stock. It might not have much impact on the overall sentiment.

The fourth tweet: ""when you have nothing else to compete with , you compete on price . that's the last thing . $ wmt $ tgt $ amzn $ aapl $ goog $ msft"". This one talks about competition and focusing on price, which is a strategic business approach. It doesn't mention anything positive or negative about Google itself, so it might not affect the stock.

The fifth tweet: ""$ pra find more winners like $ uri $ aet $ goog wallstreet URL"". Similar to the third tweet, this seems to be discussing other companies but lacks specific information on whether it affects Google's stock price. No clear impact here.

The sixth tweet: ""google ' c ' : murray launches his new album URL $ goog"". This is another typo or maybe a play on words about Google and Murray (a band). Again, no positive or negative info related to the stock, just playful remarks.

So summarizing each tweet's sentiment:

1. Joke without positive/negative intent.
2. Discusses past events affecting investor sentiment positively.
3. Vague with no direct impact.
4. Strategic business approach not connected to Google's performance.
5. Other companies but no information on Google's stock.
6. Playful remark without impacting the company.

Overall, the positive tweet 2 has some positive sentiment, and the negative would be none based on other tweets. So the overall sentiment seems neutral because one tweet is positive and others are not supportive of any direction."
2014-08-16,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a given company. The user provided a list of ten tweets and asked me to pick one based on their impact.

First, let's go through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions ""c"", which stands for SEO marketing. That doesn't seem directly related to Google's performance unless it's about content creation or something else, but it doesn't look positive or negative.
2. The second tweet talks about Yahoo rejecting an offer to acquire Google for $1 million and mentions the company is worth $360-410 billion. This seems like a negative statement because acquiring another major tech company would hurt Google's valuation.
3. Third tweet repeats the same info as the second one, so it reinforces the concern that Google might drop significantly in value.
4. Fourth tweet also says Yahoo is rejecting an offer to buy Google and mentions Google's worth. Again, this is a negative sign for Google.
5. The fifth tweet asks if I should hold certain stocks like $cmp, $lnc, etc., which are probably unrelated to Google unless they're other companies.
6. Similar to the first few tweets; it talks about another tech company but doesn't mention Google's performance.
7. Repeating the same info again.
8. The eighth tweet mentions shark problems for Google Inc. in NASDAQ. This is definitely negative because a company facing threats could reduce its stock price.
9. Ninth tweet says $ goog filed, and mentions several other stocks: ewj, hyg, unw, vxx. These are futures, options, etc., not directly related to Google's performance.
10. Tenth tweet talks about PPS seeking other stocks but doesn't mention Google.

Looking at the impact of these tweets:

- Tweets 2 through 4 are all negative because they state that Yahoo is selling off Google or that Google is undervalued.
- The fifth and seventh tweets ask about other stocks, so no direct impact on Google's price.
- The eighth tweet mentions ""shark problems,"" which implies issues within the company that could negatively affect its valuation.

Since most of these tweets are either negative (e.g., $ goog being sold off) or indicate a potential decline in Google's performance, especially through negative statements about Yahoo and potential threats to the company, I conclude this tweet is likely negative."
2014-08-17,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price of a company based on the given information. The user provided three tweets and wants me to determine if each is positive, neutral, or negative. 

First, looking at the first tweet: ""best pennystock research $ ges $ vmc $ yum $ goog financialnews URL."" This seems like it's promoting $ pennystock as a great investment because it mentions $ goog and financial news. It sounds like they're suggesting it could increase in value, so that might be positive.

Next, the second tweet: ""rt AT_USER 10 companies control the internet : 1 $ goog ( 40 % of internet traffic ) 2 $ msft 3 $ fb 4 $ yhoo 5 wikimedia 6 $ amzn URL."" This is a Twitter query where users are telling others that out of 10 companies, 40% control the internet. The user mentions several stocks like goog, msft, fb, yhoo, and am zn, which suggests they're advising people to invest in those companies because they control the majority of internet traffic. This seems like a strong recommendation for stock performance.

Lastly, the third tweet: ""$ dte stock market reports on stocks like $ xray $ emn $ goog try this URL."" The user is informing others that their stock market data is available on certain platforms or URLs. I'm not sure what DTE stands for here, but if they're providing market insights, it's more about the information source rather than predicting stock performance.

Now, evaluating each tweet: 

1. The first one seems like a call to action and promoting investment ideas.
2. The second is a detailed list of stocks that are advised by others who have control over the internet traffic.
3. The third doesn't seem directly related to stock performance but rather about accessing market reports.

Considering all these, the positive tweets indicate increased interest in investing, especially within specific sectors with high internet control. This could boost investor confidence and lead to an increase in stock prices. However, the neutral tweet suggests a cautious approach or more cautious sentiment, but overall, combining the positive trends seems favorable for the stock price."
2014-08-18,Neutral,"Alright, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of Google. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First tweet: It mentions Google's 10-year IPO at $85 and says it's exiting the market. I know that IPOs can be a big deal because they're often seen as signals for investors, especially in tech. They might increase investor confidence or give them more money to invest in future projects.

Second tweet: The user is happy about Google's 10-year anniversary and asks how it's doing on the market. That positive note probably reflects well on their recent performance but doesn't seem to indicate immediate changes that could affect stock price trends.

Third tweet talks about default probabilities for Google's annual reports, which are usually a sign of financial health. If the company is having issues with defaults, it might impact investor confidence, so this could be negative.

Fourth and fifth tweets link Google's prices to other companies like Apple, Rbbt, etc., using symbols that I recognize as stock exchanges or exchange rates. It seems like these are unrelated to Google's performance but might be misleading investors about the company's current standing.

Sixth tweet mentions various stock symbols related to different companies, including corn and diabetes. This seems out of context and doesn't provide any information about Google, so it probably isn't relevant.

So putting this together, the positive note from the 10-year anniversary is a good sign, but the mention of default probabilities for the next five years could be negative because if their financials are bad, investors might fear them. The other tweets don't seem to relate to Google's performance, so they probably aren't impacting the stock price much.

Therefore, while there's some positive sentiment from the anniversary, the financial health mentioned in the third tweet is a red flag that could pull the stock down."
2014-08-19,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided a list of tweets related to GOOG, the Google stock. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking through them, the most prominent is ""GOOG,"" which appears in multiple tweets. So, the target is GOOG, specifically Google Inc.

Next, for each tweet, I should separate the factors into positive and negative. But since all these tweets seem to be providing information about Google's performance or changes related to it, I might have a mix of different topics here. For example, some are discussing search data, while others talk about investment strategies.

Now, assessing the sentiment of each tweet. Sentiment can come from various angles—whether something is improving, deteriorating, or neutral. Some tweets state that Google has its ipo 10 years ago and it's now worth $139k. That sounds positive because investors are seeing a potential gain if Google continues to grow.

Other tweets mention trends in the NASDAQ 100 stocks but don't indicate an overall up or down trend. They might be part of broader market analysis, so not sure about sentiment yet.

There's also a tweet questioning whether Google is still a growth stock. That's more of a question than a statement, so less likely to significantly impact the stock price.

Overall, most tweets are factual and don't present strong positive or negative opinions. Some mention growth potential from the IPo experience, which can be seen as an opportunity for investors. The other tweets aren't providing clear sentiment indicators but might reflect general market conditions rather than a specific company's performance.

Considering all this, I think there isn't enough evidence to make a strong conclusion about whether Google is going up or down. The positive aspect about growth potential could be a slight push, but the lack of direct statements makes it hard to decide between [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. However, since some tweets are about future trends that might signal improvement, I'm leaning towards a slightly positive outlook overall."
2014-08-20,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about Google's stock. Hmm, first I need to extract the target stock from each tweet. Looking at them, it seems like all the tweets are related to Google (GOOGL) or similar terms with a $ goog or $ googl suffix.

Starting with the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER a $ 10,000 investment in google at its $ 85 ipo price would be worth $ 139,458 . 82 today . URL $ goog."" So, the target stock here is GOOGL. It mentions an investment and gives a value after a certain number of days. That seems like a positive sentiment because it's showing potential growth.

The second tweet: "" unlimited google apps storage like $ goog"" doesn't specify the stock, but since all other tweets are about Google or similar, maybe I should assume GOOGL again. It just adds something about apps storage, which is related to services that could potentially affect revenue, which might be neutral.

Third tweet: ""in 2004 , google had 64 million monthly visitors . today it has 236 million . google's big decade : URL $ goog."" This seems like a factual update about Google's visitor numbers. It could indicate growth in the company, which is positive.

Fourth tweet: ""$ goog driverless cars allowed to speed up to 10 mph to maintain flow of traffic : who will pay for the ticket ? URL"" Again, GOOGL. It brings up a legal or regulatory issue with car technology, which might affect revenue. This could be neutral because it's about regulations but not necessarily positive or negative.

Fifth tweet: ""5 things that could derail google's stock URL $ goog via AT_USER."" Another reference to Google, and mentions specific events that could impact the stock. It suggests problems that would lead investors to sell, which is negative sentiment.

Sixth tweet: ""$ aapl + $ goog = 1trillion $ right now . something is very right with the world . innovation"" This seems like a financial statement or economic indicator. If Google's stock is part of a global investment portfolio, it could indicate growth and be positive.

Seventh tweet: ""beyond ' don't be evil' : how google defined its mission 10 years ago , and how it changed URL $ goog URL."" This again refers to Google, but discussing its mission statement changes. Mission statements can affect the company's direction and possibly future performance; this could be positive if they're reorienting towards innovation or sustainability.

Eighth tweet: ""ten years ago google had 3,021 employees ; today it has over 52,000 URL $ goog"" This is a factual update about the number of employees. More employees could indicate growth and potential for higher stock value; positive sentiment.

Ninth tweet: ""a $ 10,000 investment in google at its $ 85 ipo price would be worth $ 139,458 . 82 today . URL $ goog"" Similar to the first tweet, showing an investment's potential growth. Positive because it suggests the stock could increase in value.

Tenth tweet: ""google – every investor's dream come true $ goog URL"" This is a general statement expressing optimism about Google becoming a global leader. It's very positive and likely increases investor sentiment towards GOOGL.

Eleventh tweet: ""beyond ' don't be evil' : how google defined its mission 10 years ago , and how it changed URL $ goog URL"" Another mention of Google, discussing its past mission statements. This could indicate ongoing strategy changes or goals that might affect future performance; positive if they align with broader vision.

Twelfth tweet: ""5 things you need to know about the chinese biggest search engine baidu URL $bidu $ googl $ yhoo"" So, this is about Baidu as well. It's another stock, but not Google. If it was referring to Google's performance relative to Baidu, that could be neutral because they are different companies.

Thirteenth tweet: ""in 2004 , google had 64 million monthly visitors . today it has 236 million . google's big decade : URL $ goog"" Similar to the third tweet about visitor numbers. Positive as it shows growth in business metrics; thus, positive sentiment.

Now, combining all these tweets: several are about Google, others mention other companies but likely related. The key points from Google tweets include potential investment returns (first, fifth, ninth), employee growth (eighth), regulatory issues (fourth and seventh?), and general optimistic outlook (tenth). The third tweet is factual data on visitor numbers which could influence stock performance positively.

However, the fourth tweet discusses driverless cars affecting traffic flow, which might negatively impact Google's revenue if they take away funding. The fifth tweet talks about stock derailment because of specific events, which would be negative.

Putting it all together, while there are positive tweets like higher employees and potential growth from investments, there are also negative factors that could hurt the stock, especially if those events occur."
2014-08-21,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company like Google.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet: ""No login required - URL."" Hmm, that's a bit confusing. The word ""URL"" might refer to an online stock market or trading platform. So, maybe it's referring to $G oo g l e as the stock symbol.

Now, each tweet needs to be broken down into factors and sentiment analysis.

The first tweet says: ""rt AT_USER a $ 10,000 investment in google at its $ 85 ipo price would be worth $ 139,458 . 82 today .""

So, the positive factor here is an increase in value. The user is talking about a specific investment and its potential growth. It's encouraging the investor to see that their money could grow significantly. That sounds like a positive outlook.

The negative factor isn't explicitly stated, but since it's a $10k investment at $85, which is quite low, maybe there are factors that suggest the stock might drop? However, it also mentions 82, which is today's price, so maybe they're just calculating the potential value based on the IPO. Not sure if that leads to an upward or downward trend.

The second tweet is: ""rt AT_USER a $ 10,000 investment in google at its $ 85 ipo price would be worth $ 139,458 . 82 today .""

This seems identical except for minor typos. So both tweets are essentially saying the same thing about the potential growth of an investment. They're encouraging users to see how their money could grow and maybe hint at a significant gain.

Now, considering the factors:

Positive: The tweet is promoting a favorable view about Google's stock and the possible gain from a specific investment. This seems like a positive factor because it boosts investor confidence and outlook on the stock.

Negative: Since there are no negative factors mentioned, but just an invitation to see if the market would appreciate, maybe this doesn't lean towards a negative impact. However, given that Google is a major player in the tech industry, and the investment context is specific, perhaps there's some underlying sentiment of support or expectation of growth.

So combining the positive factor and considering the lack of negatives, it seems like the overall sentiment is leaning towards a positive. It's encouraging potential investors to watch their money grow, which generally can be seen as a positive for the stock price."
2014-08-22,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their likely impact on TSLA's stock price. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

First tweet: It mentions $ kndi green and at hod with some other stocks listed. That doesn't seem directly related to TSLA or any company associated with TSLA, so probably not a positive or negative factor for TSLA. 

Second tweet is about $ goog receiving a new alert on finding out the reason why their stock was affected by daytrading trading mkt nyse nasdaq markets 94. This seems like an update from Google's management regarding market conditions affecting their stocks, which could influence investor sentiment but doesn't directly relate to TSLA.

Third tweet is about $ goog mentioning salesforce and gamestop leading tech stocks on URL. Again, this is unrelated to TSLA or any other companies mentioned here. There’s no mention of TSLA's performance or impact from Google.

Since none of these tweets are related to TSLA or affecting the company's stock price directly, it seems like there's no clear positive, neutral, or negative impact on TSLA from these tweets."
2014-08-23,Missing,File not found
2014-08-24,Neutral,"Okay, so I have to analyze these tweets about the stock price impact on a given company. The user provided three tweets and wants me to determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative for their stock's future value.

First, I'll start by identifying the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""google ($ goog ) funded robotic startup savioke unveils a hotel delivery robot . URL."" It doesn't specify the company name, but since it mentions $ goog, which is Google, maybe that's the company? The tweet talks about Google funding something and launching a robot for hotels. So I'll focus on Google.

Next, the second tweet: "" $ dal market cap URL also see : $ gdx $ goog $ ac / b.to $ gpro ~"" This seems like it might be referring to some stock symbols, but without context, it's hard to tell. It mentions gdx, goog, ac, and gpro as stock names. I'll note those down.

Third tweet: ""rt AT_USER google said to be weighing youtube , gmail accounts for kids URL $ goog $ fb"" Again, this seems to reference Google and possibly some other companies like YouTube (which is Y) or Gmail. It mentions Google and its focus on YouTube and Gmail as part of its strategy, so again, Google might be the target.

Now, looking at each tweet one by one:

1. The first tweet talks about Google funding a startup and launching a hotel delivery robot. This sounds like it's positive because Google is involved in developing innovative technologies for businesses, which could boost their stock. However, I'm not sure if this directly affects Google itself or another company. It might be more of an industry update rather than a specific target.

2. The second tweet mentions multiple companies with $ goog and $ gdx as stock names. This could indicate that these are various stocks the user is tracking related to Google's performance, but without knowing which ones, it's hard to assess their impact on Google itself.

3. The third tweet says Google is weighing YouTube and Gmail, which seems like a strategic move for Google. While this doesn't directly mention Google as a target stock, it might suggest that the company is investing in other platforms or services, which could be seen as an indicator of future growth but not necessarily affecting Google's own stock.

Considering each tweet individually, the first one talks about Google being involved in a startup and marketing something else. The third tweet is about Google's strategic focus, which doesn't specifically target any particular stock unless the others are part of a larger set that the user is monitoring.

Since I don't have context on which specific stocks the user is tracking or how each tweet relates to their investments, it's challenging to determine if these tweets are directly influencing their stock prices. They might be discussing broader trends in tech or general company developments, which could affect other companies' valuations but not Google itself.

Therefore, without more information about the user's portfolio and the specific stocks they're focusing on, I can't definitively categorize each tweet as positive, neutral, or negative towards Google's stock price. However, if these tweets are part of a broader context where the focus is on tech companies, it might lead to positive sentiment due to general market trends.

But sticking strictly to the given information and considering each tweet in isolation, I think all three might be looking at different aspects that could indirectly influence other companies but not Google's stock directly. So, perhaps they're more about industry or broader trends rather than specific target stocks."
2014-08-25,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a given company. The user provided eight tweets and wants me to analyze them. Let's break it down step by step.

First, each tweet is separate, but they all relate to the same stock, possibly Google (GOOG). I'll look for symbols or mentions that might indicate which company we're talking about. Some have 'goog', others like 'apl' or 'mstc'.

Starting with the first tweet: ""$ sdiv change URL also see : $ sxt $ tkmr $ goog $ lvs ~"". Hmm, not sure what these symbols represent. Maybe it's a typo or part of another query. I'll leave this one as unclear for now.

Second tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ aapl $ goog $ pcln $ nflx $ fb options $ king big volume options strike : 14 URL"". The user is mentioning a company, probably something with 'options' in the name since that's common in finance. It seems like the user might be buying options on Google or Facebook. High volume could indicate strong sentiment.

Third tweet: ""huge steal from under $ goog ' s nose . rt AT_USER amazon will buy twitch for more than $ 1 billion / URL"". This looks like a deal: Amazon is buying Twitch for over a billion dollars. That's a significant purchase, suggesting positive news about Google or the tech sector overall.

Fourth tweet: ""$ goog - it's time to take artificial intelligence seriously URL"". The user is focusing on AI being taken seriously in their discussion of Google. This could mean they're supporting Google and seeing advancements in AI, which might positively affect stock performance.

Fifth tweet: ""growth in downloads slows , favoring $ fb & $ goog . mt AT_USER apps beat websites with 52 % of time on digital media . URL"". Growth slowing for Facebook might indicate that users are less active, but the market might still recover. However, growth for Google could lead to positive trends.

Sixth tweet: ""why do people think that what $ amzn is going to do with twitch will be vastly different than what $ goog / yt would have done ?"". Comparing Amazon and Google's views on Twitch could imply a competitive environment where both are affected by the same events, potentially causing sentiment shifts in their stock prices.

Seventh tweet: ""active stock : a report on the google ( nasdaq goog ) stock $ goog : URL"". The user is suggesting they access a report on Google's stock. While this might not be about the company itself, it could influence investor expectations if the report supports a positive outlook.

Eighth tweet: ""access curated tweets - high relevancy , less spam - us tech giants URL $ msft $ twtr $ aapl $ fb $ goog"". This seems like a general statement promoting the use of curative tweets for all US tech companies. It might encourage others to engage with relevant content, which could influence stock sentiment positively.

Putting it all together, each tweet is either positive, negative, or neutral in its impact on Google's stock. The user provided a mix of mentions, buy-sell activities, and comparisons between competitors. These can indicate growth, strategic moves, or potential market reactions, which would make the overall sentiment Positive because the focus seems to be on positive developments like new investments, competitive analysis, or favorable news about the company."
2014-08-26,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their likely impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided four tweets and specified an output format of [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative].

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Let me go through them one by one.

1. "". AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER they should have sold to $ goog what on earth will $ amzn do wiht it ?"" The stock here is AMZN. This tweet seems like a rhetorical question, maybe testing investor confidence or expectations about Amazon's performance. It might be seen as a bit concerning, but not necessarily negative.

2. ""$ brcm day high URL also see : $ cig $ goog $ flt $ ffiv ~"" The word ""brcm"" doesn't make sense in this context, so perhaps this is an error or irrelevant tweet. I'll consider it neutral since the relevant stock isn't mentioned here.

3. ""google ' c ' : rbi diktat on uber could affect google and apple too URL $ goog"" This tweet mentions Google's potential impact on Apple (AAPL) via Uber. It doesn't mention a specific stock, so I can't identify it yet. However, it suggests a possible relationship or impact between companies.

4. ""investors . $ aapl , $ tsla , $ goog sentiment flat after hours ."" This tweet lists the stocks of Apple (APL), Tesla (TSLA), and Amazon (AMZN) with a neutral sentiment. The phrase ""sentiment flat"" might mean that investors are uncertain or not seeing strong movements, but it's unclear if this affects any specific stock.

Now, combining these thoughts: The first tweet is about Amazon, which could indicate fear or uncertainty. The third tweet relates to Google and Apple, suggesting possible market connections. The fourth mentions multiple stocks with neutral sentiment towards their performance. Without specific details on the companies, I can't be certain of the impact. However, given the general nature, it might not significantly affect any stock.

I think this overall is [Neutral], considering no clear positive or negative signals without more context."
2014-08-27,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of AT_USER, which has the symbol ""AT_USER"". 

First, looking at the first tweet: ""AT_USER that horid $ fb dg just gave the hft algo's some push to short $ goog $ googl twtr and $ aapl"" The user mentions something about financial regulations and a HFT algorithm pushing against Google and Apple stocks. I know financial regulations can sometimes lead to higher stock prices because investors feel more confident in their decisions. However, if it's considered horrid or negative, that might not be the case. So, this could have a neutral effect.

Next tweet: $ goog is buying visual effects startup zync, which is a tech startup focusing on animation and effects. While tech startups can sometimes see growth, they also depend on the broader market conditions. If zync is rising but affected by broader market trends or regulations, it might influence AT_USER negatively if this affects the overall tech sector.

Third tweet: $ goog mentions ""summary URL also see : $ rig $ twtr $ tcn.to $ intc ~"" This seems unrelated to Google's stock and more like a link or typo. It doesn't seem to impact AT_USER at all. 

So, considering these tweets, while the first one might have some positive sentiment due to financial regulations, the second tweet introduces something from a tech startup that could be volatile but not directly linked to Google. The third is irrelevant. 

In summary, the main effect seems limited and could have mixed feelings. Maybe neutral overall."
2014-08-28,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided some specific instructions, so I need to follow them carefully.

First, they mentioned identifying the target stock by extracting the symbol from the tweets. Looking at the tweets given, I don't see any mention of the stock's symbol, so that might be a problem. Hmm, maybe all these tweets are about Google? Let me check each tweet again.

Looking at tweet 1: ""$ goog new sec document ( s ) for google inc . from our stock news alerts app"". Okay, this clearly mentions Google and ""stock news alerts app."" So I think the target stock is ""goog"".

Now, moving on to each tweet one by one. 

Tweet 2 lists several stocks: $ jpm , $ aapl , $ dg , etc., but since we're focusing on ""goog"", these might not be relevant unless they mention Google specifically. But none of them mention Google here.

Tweets 3 and 4 are about buy orders or methodologies for certain stocks, which could affect investor sentiment. 

Tweet 5 is positive in the sense that it's happy to not tweet $ goog, which seems like a signal to avoid making any trades or investments related to Google. That might indicate confidence in the stock.

Tweet 6 talks about a user named AT_USER (Walt) talking about mossberg products. The link mentions his channel ""exquiz + essential."" There's no mention of Google here, so this tweet is probably unrelated.

So, breaking it down:

1. Identify the target stock: goog
2. Separate factors into Positive and Negative.
   - Positive factors: tweet 5 talks about avoiding Google, which could reduce risk or increase exposure to other stocks.
   - Negative factors: no obvious negative tweets here, but perhaps if others did, they'd influence sentiment differently.

3. Assess sentiment:
   -tweet 2 is all about the list of companies, not directly related to Google's stock.
   -tweet 5 is more about avoiding a tweet about Google, which might be seen as a signal for continued investment in other stocks or cautionary statements about Google.
   
4. Overall sentiment summary: Since tweet 5 suggests avoiding Google and tweet 2 lists several tech stocks, it seems like the overall sentiment could be mixed but leaning towards a cautious approach to tech-related investments. It's not overwhelmingly positive or negative.

Wait, maybe I need to consider more factors. Since all tweets except 5 are about other stocks, but none mention Google specifically in this context, tweet 2 isn't directly relevant unless it suggests that the user is interested in multiple tech stocks, which might imply diversification. That could be seen as a positive strategy by avoiding concentration risk.

So considering that, while there's no explicit negative tweet, tweet 5 is the only one about Google and it's a positive statement regarding avoiding related information or trades. Therefore, overall sentiment seems to be leaning more towards cautious but somewhat neutral because not all tweets are in line with each other."
2014-08-29,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for the given company. The user provided a set of tweets and wants me to conclude whether they're positive, neutral, or negative regarding the stock's future value.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Let me go through them one by one.

1. $ goog stock message board URL also see : $ xhb $ ura $ adre $ kgc ~
   - Hmm, this seems a bit unclear. It mentions $ goog and some URLs like xhb, ura, etc., which don't immediately suggest the company name or stock ticker. Maybe it's not providing information about the specific stock we're analyzing.
   
2. $ f dividend URL also see : $ aria $ axcg $ goog $ hal ~
   - Here, ""f"" might stand for ""female,"" but more importantly, it mentions a dividend. Dividends can influence investor sentiment positively because they show growth and are often seen as a sign of the company's financial health.
   
3. google working on the development of drones , which will be used for product delivery URL $ goog
   - This tweet talks about Google developing drones for product delivery. Drones are a tech-related sector, but it doesn't specify if this is good or bad news. It could be positive if they're improving the company's technology, but without more context, I can't say for sure.
   
4. rt AT_USER google is the latest company to start testing delivery drones : URL $ goog URL
   - Similar to tweet 3, it mentions Google working on drones. The mention of ""rt"" might be a typo or specific to another tweet. If it's about testing drones, this could indicate a positive development for the tech sector.
   
5. google ’ s smith said to be headed to washington for u . s . cto role $ goog
   - This one has a more official tone and mentions Google's CTO moving to Washington. That's significant because it could affect the company's leadership, possibly leading to changes in management and potentially affecting financial performance.
   
6. 信奉 『 买好公司 』、 『 买股买成股东 』 的新手 ， 是不是应该等google跌到 550以下买他10股压压惊 , 存个二 、三十年定期 $ goog
   - This one is in Chinese. The phrase ""信奉"" means ""trust,"" and it's a bit convoluted. It seems to suggest that investors are considering whether to buy Google, either as a company or as a stock. It doesn't specify the expected price range but mentions ""550 below."" If they're buying stocks when the price is about to drop, this could be positive because it indicates potential gains.
   
7. rt AT_USER google is the latest company to start testing delivery drones : URL $ goog URL
   - Again, similar to tweet 3 and 4. Just mentions Google working on drones for product delivery. Not enough info without knowing if it's good or bad.

8. rt AT_USER google is the latest company to start testing delivery drones : URL $ goog URL
   - Same as tweet 7; same content here.

9. google is developing delivery drones URL $ goog URL

Now, compiling all this information: 

- Dividend mentions (tweets 2 and maybe others?) could be positive if related to future performance.
- Drone development (tweets 3,4,5) might affect the tech sector positively or negatively depending on specifics.
- CTO move (tweet 5) is significant as it affects leadership changes, which can impact financials.
- Stock buy offers (tweets 6 and 7) suggest a focus on investing, implying possible positive sentiment if they're targeting growth.

Given that some tweets are about dividends, drone development, and leadership changes, these could all contribute positively or negatively. However, without specific context on the industry or company's current performance, it's hard to assign clear sentiment. But considering trends in tech and growth potential for the stock, it leans towards a positive outlook. So I'm leaning toward a positive sentiment."
2014-08-30,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the future stock price of a company. Let's go through each tweet step by step.

First, identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: "" $ goog URL inc ( amzn ) and google inc ( googl ) vying for drone technology : amazon . c ... URL"" The main stocks mentioned are AMZN (Amazon) and GOG (Google). But looking closer, it says ""url inc"" which might be a typo. So maybe the target stocks are AMZN and GOG.

Next, I'll look at each tweet:

1. **Tweet 1**: It mentions two companies vying for drone technology, but it's unclear what stock they're focusing on. The mention of ""url inc ( amzn )"" might be a typo or misspelling. If the focus is on AMZN, which is Amazon, I need to check if there are any positive or negative factors related to AMZN.

2. **Tweet 2**: It says, ""rt AT_USER bot a little $ aapl and $ goog on today's - . 4 % dips hope no more sell off eod."" This tweet seems to be in Chinese and uses some technical terms. The mention of a 4% dip with hopes of no more sell-off until EOD (end of day) suggests that there might be concern about the stock prices going down. It's quite vague, but I can see it's expressing uncertainty.

3. **Tweet 3**: ""rt AT_USER $ aapl $ goog $ pcln $ nflx $ fb options $ tsla $ twtr $ rprx booooooooooooooooooom URL"" This one seems more upbeat. The word ""booooooooooooooooooom"" is slang for massive gains, so it's clearly positive. It mentions several stocks and uses a lot of positive emojis.

Now, let me break down each tweet:

- **Tweet 1**: No explicit mention of AMZN or GOG factors. It might be about drone technology, which isn't directly related to the target stocks unless there's speculation on their performance.
  
- **Tweet 2**: The user is expressing uncertainty due to a dip and hope for no more sell-offs. This could indicate investor sentiment is negative because they're worried about potential sells off.

- **Tweet 3**: Positive factors with upbeat language. This tweet likely supports the target stocks, boosting investor confidence.

Considering all tweets, there's some positive mention of TSLA (Time) in Tweet 3 and a mix of thoughts in Tweet 2 regarding AMZN and GOG. However, the overall sentiment seems more positive due to Tweet 3 being clear about the stock prices."
2014-08-31,Positive,"Alright, let me tackle this query step by step. The user provided two tweets and wants to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. They've given specific instructions to analyze each tweet separately, separate positive and negative factors, assess sentiment, and then combine them for an overall conclusion.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Both tweets mention ""A PLUS"" as the stock symbol, so that's clear: Apple Inc., or ""AAPL"".

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one. The first tweet says, ""age isn't a requirement to do well . "" with links to Apple and Google court younger and younger coders. The second is identical but repeats its own message.

For the first tweet, it's a positive note about coders being attracted by younger people on platforms like Apple and Google. I think this could influence investor sentiment positively because mentioning trends in tech and software development can attract young talent and show potential in the industry.

Looking at factors, the tweet might not directly target any specific product or company but rather talks about coding trends. This is more of a general positive message that doesn't specifically mention any stock yet.

As for sentiments, this seems like a subtle and positive outlook. It's encouraging others to engage with younger coders, which could be seen as building momentum in the tech field. I might lean towards a positive sentiment here because it's about future trends rather than any particular stock performance.

The second tweet is identical to the first one, so it will have the same analysis. It reinforces the idea that coding opportunities are growing on these platforms. This consistent and positive message suggests good growth potential in the tech sector.

Combining both tweets, they're both highlighting a trend in young coders. While they don't directly mention Apple or Google, they do suggest that the company could benefit from this trend by attracting skilled professionals. This can positively impact investor confidence as the company's workforce might align with these trends.

Considering the overall sentiment summary, each tweet contributes positively to the expectation of good stock performance. There are no negative factors here; instead, they're about future prospects and potential growth in tech-related sectors."
2014-09-01,Missing,File not found
2014-09-02,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this task. So, I have these tweets and I need to determine whether they'll impact the stock price positively, neutrally, or negatively for a given company. The example given is about Google building drones with a URL, which probably leads to more job opportunities, which in turn would increase demand for their stock.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. In this case, it seems like it's ""goog"", so we're talking about Google. Now, each tweet will have factors and sentiments that I need to analyze.

Looking at the first tweet: ""google to build drones ? $ goog URL"". So, the user is building drones but hasn't done anything yet. The fact here is about drone-building, which could lead to more jobs in manufacturing or related industries. If there's a positive angle of job growth and increased demand for their stock, that would be a strong factor.

Next, I need to assess each tweet for Positive (P) and Negative (N) factors. For the first tweet:

Positive Factors: drone-building is a good tech trend with potential job creation.
Negative Factors: No negative points mentioned here. It's more about setting up rather than facing challenges.

Sentiment: This tweet seems neutral because it's providing information that could positively affect demand without any indication of sentiment change.

Now, I have to consider other tweets if there are more provided, but in this case, only one is given. So, the overall sentiment would be based on this single tweet. Since the main point is about potential job growth and positive factors, it should lead to a Positive impact on Google's stock price."
2014-09-03,Neutral,"Okay, let's see what I need to do here. The user has given me some tweets about a company and wants me to analyze their impact on the stock price. They provided specific steps: first identifying the target stock symbol from the tweets, then analyzing each tweet for positive or negative factors, assessing sentiment, and combining that into an overall sentiment. Then I have to conclude with ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"".

Looking at the tweets provided:

1. The user starts by listing several stocks but doesn't specify a particular one yet. That's a problem because without knowing which stock they're referring to, I can't determine if it's up or down.
2. The next tweet seems to be repeating the same text from the first one. It lists the stocks again and asks about the biggest U.S. tech companies founded by immigrants. This repetition might indicate a pattern, but without the target stock, it's hard to assess anything.
3. The fourth tweet is similar to the second, listing multiple stocks in order. Again, without knowing which company it is, I can't proceed.
4. Now comes the fifth tweet: ""google healthcare startup calico partners with abbvie - adam's biotech beat - URL $ googl $ goog headlines invest"". This seems relevant because it mentions Google, a well-known company. It talks about Calico, a healthcare startup, collaborating with Abbie Velocity and Adam Smith's business strategies. The mention of Google in both dollars and keywords suggests positive information.
5. The sixth tweet is another listing without specifics but mentions Google again, so it's repeating the same structure.
6. The seventh tweet starts with ""rt AT_USER google inc . ( goog )"": $ myec & $ goog is in google wallet URL. This uses Google-related hashtags, which might be a positive sign because investors often follow companies they support. But I need to know the target stock to assess sentiment accurately.
7. The eighth tweet repeats another listing without details.
8. The ninth and tenth tweets are about option millionaires and uranium-pinto-beans companies, mentioning Google again in quotes.

Now, considering all these tweets, I can see that most of them mention Google or other tech companies but don't specify which one. Some are repeating lists, while others discuss Calico and their collaborations with tech firms. The fifth tweet mentions Google in a positive context about healthcare startups and business strategies, which could be a sign of good news.

Since the target stock isn't provided, I can't determine if the sentiment is positive or negative for that specific company. Without knowing the stock symbol, it's impossible to assess any impact on its price. Maybe the user will provide more details so I can make an accurate conclusion."
2014-09-04,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of TCCO. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. The main mention is ""tcco"", so that's our focus.

Now, looking at each tweet:

1. The first tweet says ""$ tcco demand for cyber security set to explode..."" This seems positive because it mentions increased demand for cybersecurity, which could boost the company's stock.

2. The second tweet is about Google refunding a purchase case for kids. While this event could impact the company's revenue, I'm not sure if it directly affects TCCO. Maybe there's some indirect effect, but it seems less likely to be positive or negative right now.

3. The third tweet talks about September 4th filing for incorporation in California, with Google involved. This is a legal matter and doesn't necessarily relate to the stock performance yet.

4. The fourth tweet is ""rt AT_USER $ goog wedge continues - - will wait & see b4 jumping in URL"". This seems positive as it suggests that Google's stock might go up, which could positively affect TCCO if there's some related business deal or partnership.

Putting this together, the first and fourth tweets are strong positives. The second tweet doesn't seem directly relevant to TCCO. The third is irrelevant due to the legal aspect. So overall, I think it should be positive."
2014-09-05,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on stock prices. First, I need to extract the target stock from each tweet.

Looking at the first tweet: ""google ' c ' : sage opens up its business to google viewers URL $ goog"". Hmm, it's a bit confusing because of the 'c' symbol and the dollar signs. Maybe that refers to Google? So I think the stock is Google (GOOGL).

Next tweet: ""goog investopedia $ goog $ jpm $ cnq.to $ pcln $ dust opinion , 200 simple moving average , high , recent headlines , getti URL"". This seems like it's talking about investing, mentioning things like moving averages and gettingi.com. So this might be related to Google too since it's using ""goog"" and possibly invested in something. But I'm not entirely sure if this is Google's stock or something else.

Third tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ epgl lands exclusive deal with the cooper companies $ coo ! direct competition to $ goog $ nvs wearabletech smartlens"". This seems more about a company called EPGL landing an exclusive deal. The word ""smartlens"" is in there, which might be related to Google because smart glasses are a product line they make. So maybe this tweet is referring to a competitor, EPGL, from Google's products.

Now I have three different stocks: GOOGL, something else (probably EPGL), and another company that isn't mentioned. But since the output needs to be about Google, perhaps the main focus should be on GOOG.

Analyzing each tweet:

First tweet is likely positive because it opens up a business to viewers, which could mean new investments or expansion. It mentions Google, so probably positive sentiment.

Second tweet mentions investing, talking about moving averages and recent headlines. This might be negative because investing can be risky, but it's speculative. Not sure yet.

Third tweet talks about EPGL landing a deal with Google, suggesting they have a direct competitor. So maybe negative if their products are competitors, impacting the market.

Putting it all together: Positive from GOOGL mention, Negative from EPGL, and Neutral from the other investment-related info. But since the output should be based on the target stock (GOOGL), I think the main factors to consider are GOOGL's performance.

However, without knowing if these tweets are news about Google or unrelated topics, it's hard to determine a clear overall sentiment. But focusing on GOOGL, the tweet mentions a business opening, which could be positive, and EPGL being a competitor, which is negative."
2014-09-06,Positive,"Alright, so I need to determine whether the given tweet has a positive, neutral, or negative impact on a company's stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the tweet is ""much-awaited moto 360 goes on sale ! URL $ msi $ goog"". The target stock symbol here seems to be MSCI since it mentions $ msi $ goog. I'll focus on how each part of the sentence affects the company's performance.

The first part says ""much-awaited moto 360 goes on sale!"". This sounds like a marketing or promotional announcement about the company. When companies announce major product launches, especially in tech sectors, they often boost investor confidence because it signifies growth and potential positive news. So this likely has a positive impact.

Next, the tweet includes links to ""msi"" and ""goog"", but I'm not sure what those stand for. MSCI is a stock index, but without knowing more about msi, I can't say much. However, the mention of Google seems significant because it's a major tech company. When companies announce earnings or product launches with big names like Google, they often boost the economy and the stock price.

So putting it together, the tweet is promoting MSCI stock as going on sale, which likely means the stock is expected to rise. The links to Google might be part of that promotion, reinforcing a positive outlook for the company's future performance. Therefore, this should result in a positive overall sentiment."
2014-09-07,Positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually and then combine them.

First tweet: ""stocks making headlines : google ( nasdaq goog ) settles ftc complaints $ goog : URL"". Hmm, this seems to be about Google's stock performance. The mention of NASDAQ and GOOG makes sense as the stock symbol. It says the stock settles with "" FTC complaints"" and the price is up by $. I'm not sure what specific complaint that refers to, but if it's related to something positive, like increased investor confidence, then this could be a positive factor.

Second tweet: ""really interesting article ! ! $ fb $ aapl $ goog $ tsla $ gpro weekend charts : rally myth busters URL via AT_USER"". This is about Facebook and other tech companies. The word ""rally"" suggests support or excitement, which might indicate that investors are optimistic. The words ""myth busters"" could be attacking some old views on the market or products, but it's possible these tweets are promoting growth or positive trends.

Combining both tweets, they're both related to tech stocks, specifically Google and Facebook. Google's tweet talks about a complaint, which might mean positive news if it's a regulatory issue that investors see as an opportunity. Facebook is also mentioned, which could be part of their recent performance or market analysis. The fact that there are multiple mentions of ""rally"" from these companies suggests increased activity.

Looking at the sentiment, each tweet is positive about the stock performance and investor reactions. Even though some might question market trends (like ""myth busters""), the overall tone seems more focused on optimism rather than negative concerns. So, despite minor doubts, the tweets are reinforcing a positive outlook."
2014-09-08,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on a company's stock price. The user has given me five tweets and an example output which is ""[Negative]"". I need to apply similar logic here.

First, looking at each tweet individually. 

1. The first tweet mentions Mobi, Googling, Dishes, and G conclusively. It seems to be promoting Googling's stock but also mentioning others that might not directly relate to the user's target company. So maybe it's more about market trends than a specific company.

2. The second tweet talks about binary options signals from AT_USER. Binary options are typically associated with trading, especially in markets like stocks or commodities. But I don't have any context on what these signals mean here. It could be positive if it's giving good signals to buy but might not directly impact a single stock.

3. The third tweet is a repeat of the second one. Same factors and no specific company mentioned beyond Googling and others. Not enough info for a clear assessment.

4. The fourth tweet compares Google vs Amazon with drone wars. Again, this seems like market speculation or trends rather than directly affecting a single stock's price.

5. The fifth tweet is another repeat of the previous ones about binary signals from AT_USER. Similar to tweet 2, it's speculative and might not have a clear positive impact on a stock.

Putting it all together, none of these tweets are specific enough to indicate whether they're helping or hurting a particular company. They're more about trends in the market rather than a specific stock. So the overall sentiment is neutral."
2014-09-09,Neutral,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user provided several tweets and wants an analysis of their likely impact on the stock price of a company. They mentioned specific steps: identifying the target stock symbol, analyzing each tweet for positive or negative factors, assessing sentiment, and then summarizing into one of three categories.

First, I need to extract the target stock from the tweets. Looking through the tweets, some mention $ goog, so I'll assume ""goog"" is the stock symbol. That would make the company Google, Inc.

Next, for each tweet, I have to separate positive and negative factors. Let me go through them one by one:

1. The first tweet talks about a lawyer selling property worth over $19 million on Form 4. I'm not sure if that's positive or negative. It doesn't mention any stock actions or future events, so maybe neutral.

2. The second and third tweets mention binary option signals from RT. That sounds technical but unrelated to the stock price, so probably neutral.

3. The fourth tweet says that no one at $APL could convince Tim Cook to use YouTube for streaming these events. That's a bit vague, but it seems like a lack of confidence or strategy, which might be neutral or slightly negative if it affects investor sentiment negatively.

4. The fifth tweet is similar to the fourth, just repeating the same points, so probably reinforces the same sentiment without adding much.

5. The sixth tweet talks about someone selling Google's net profit. Positive because it shows financial health, but does that directly impact stock price? Maybe a minor positive factor.

6. The seventh tweet questions if $AHL can box out PayPal despite alternatives like Google Maps being available. This seems like a strategic issue or possibly related to market competition. It might be considered a negative factor if it affects investors' decisions.

Now, compiling the sentiment analysis:

Positive factors: selling profit from Google (tweet 6), and maybe the lack of immediate information about future events (tweet5).

Negative factors: potential strategy issues with YouTube (tweets3,4,5), competition from alternatives like Google Maps (tweet7), and possibly public statements without direct stock info.

The overall sentiment seems mixed. While some positive points are there, others show uncertainty or strategic concerns that might lead to negative sentiments. Without more context, it's hard to say definitively, but I'll lean towards a neutral conclusion because the impact isn't clear-cut."
2014-09-10,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem step by step.

First, I need to analyze the given tweets related to a company's stock price impact. The user provided two tweets about investing in a California solar power plant and has already extracted the stock symbol as ""goog"". So, the stock is Google, and we're looking at sentiment towards it based on these tweets.

Looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER google invests in california solar power plant URL $ goog"". The user is clearly invested in Google by mentioning that they'll invest in a California solar power plant. This seems positive because investing suggests enthusiasm and commitment to growth, which can boost stock price.

The second tweet: ""URL is now recognized as a google trusted store URL $ tumi $ 1910 $ goog"". The user has updated the URL from 'tumi' to '$goog', which likely means Google. Recognizing it as a trusted store could imply reliability and trustworthiness in their operations, maybe leading to more confidence in their stock performance.

Now, I need to assess each tweet for positive or negative factors. In the first tweet, ""invests in California solar power plant"" is a strong indicator of positive sentiment because it directly links investment to the company. This could lead people to view Google as a stable and expanding company, which often goes hand in hand with good stock performance.

The second tweet mentions that 'tumi' URL is now recognized as Google. If this refers to their service or products, recognizing a significant brand like Google as trusted can build trust within the company. Trust and reliability are positive factors because they enhance investor confidence. So, even though I'm not entirely sure about ""tumi"" itself, the idea that it's taken as Google adds credibility.

Combining both tweets, the sentiment is likely positive for Google's stock price. The investments show potential for growth, and the recognition of a trusted brand reinforces overall optimism towards the company."
2014-09-11,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the given company. So, first off, I see that each tweet is from a user named Google trying to get their product ""c"" registered as a patent. The tweets start with phrases like ""google ' c ' : patent application titled..."" which I think are attempts to suggest how they can market or promote their product. 

I'm not entirely sure what the actual content of these tweets includes, but since they all seem focused on getting a patent registered, maybe the main message is about promoting their product's patent application to get registered. From my limited knowledge of Google's patents and their impact, I know that getting a patent can help launch new products or innovations.

So, each tweet seems to be a call to action from Google. They might be encouraging others to register their patent applications, which could lead to more sales, increased revenue, or innovation in the company. These kinds of actions often show interest and commitment towards expanding their product line or entering new markets.

Given that, I would consider positive impact because getting a patent can drive business growth. It shows that Google is serious about advancing their technology, which can positively influence investor confidence and potentially increase stock prices as they might see more growth opportunities.

I don't see any negative words here, and the tweets are all encouraging and focused on promoting the product. They're not just spam or unrelated stuff; each one has a clear intent to get registered for innovation purposes.

So, putting it together, these tweets seem to be positive signals towards future business growth and innovation, which would likely lead to an upward trend in the stock price."
2014-09-12,Negative,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on stock prices for a given company. The user has provided some tweets, but they also included an output requirement that says I should conclude with ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"". 

First, let's see what the target stock is from the first tweet: $ gs updated chart $ spy $ ulta $ aapl $ qqq $ pcln $ goog $ tsla URL. It looks like the stock symbol provided is Google (GOOGL), which makes sense because of some mentions like ""today we know where appl stands on health data . what about goog ?"" and ""facebook tries to muscle in on youtube"". So, I'll focus on Google.

Now, looking at each tweet:

1. ""$ gs updated chart $ spy $ ulta $ aapl $ qqq $ pcln $ goog $ tsla URL"": This is just a general update with multiple stock names, but no specific mention of Google or any news related to the stock. So this might not have significant impact yet.

2. ""stocks with major news : $ dri , $ aapl , $ yhoo , $ tsla , $ s , $ jpm , $ googl , $ vz , $ rsh , $ fb , $ f , $ brk-b , $ twtr , $ jdsu , $ goog , $ entr"": This is a list of stocks, but again, nothing specific about Google. It could be about general trends or other companies. Without more context, it's hard to assess.

3. ""we know where $ appl stands on health data . what about $ goog ? URL"": Here, there are mentions of Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG). The user is updating their knowledge on how these two companies stand on a topic related to health data. This seems like it could be positive because they're probably sharing information that's relevant or even promising for investors.

4. ""rt AT_USER facetube : 'facebook tries to muscle in on youtube' URL via AT_USER tv media google $ fb $ goog $ $"": This tweet is from a retweet with the hashtag # facetube. It seems like Facebook is trying to promote its YouTube presence, which could be seen as positive if it's an initiative that might attract more users or increase revenue. But I'm not sure how this directly affects Google's stock price unless there's overlap in their target audiences.

5. ""$ ebay $ goog google buy ebay ? a ‘ home run ’ says analyst URL / / disc : short various ebay puts"": This tweet is about ebay and google. The user is talking about an analyst predicting a 'home run' and suggesting selling ebay with put options. If the analyst thinks this could drive down eBay, but since ebay often has negative reactions when competitors like Google are performing well, this might be seen as positive news for Google.

6. ""$ state attorneys general will probe at & t / directv merger ! URL $ s $ t $ vz $ tmus $ goog $ dish $ msft $ aapl $ ge $ c $ si"": This is about a merger between DirectV and another company, which doesn't seem directly related to Google. The mention of ""msft"" is interesting, but it's unclear what MSFT stands for here. It seems like this tweet might be about a unrelated industry.

Now, considering all these tweets, the most significant ones are number 3 and 5. Number 3 mentions Apple and Google on health data, which could be positive if the information is relevant or could attract new investors. Number 5 refers to ebay and suggests it's doing well enough that Google should sell its shares with put options. This would push Google's stock price downward because selling shares can decrease profit.

Looking at the other tweets: they either provide general information without specific stocks, which isn't enough for a clear assessment. The ones about Facebook or DirectV are more speculative and could influence broader markets but not directly impacting Google's stock.

So overall, these two tweets seem to indicate that there's potential for Google's stock price to decrease because of positive information related to competitors or potential investor sentiment."
2014-09-13,Positive,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, I have to determine whether four tweets are positive, neutral, or negative in relation to a company's stock price impact. Hmm, okay.

First, the user provided a clear process: identify the target stock from the tweets and then analyze each tweet to assess the sentiment. The output needs to be concise with just ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"".

Looking at the given tweets:

1. ""stock contest ! ! pick $ epi and win a free tablet ! ! enter now ! click here for details : URL $ gild $ goog $ dia $ sh ~""

Okay, this one's pretty vague. It mentions entering a contest to win a tablet, but it doesn't specify which company or industry. The keyword ""gild"" isn't familiar to me as an abbreviation, and the links have unusual formats with dollar signs in the URL. Maybe that's some kind of payment system? Or perhaps it's a typo for ""gimble""? Not sure. Since there's no specific mention of the stock, I can't really assess sentiment here.

2. ""The company is leading in innovation in AI technology.""

Hmm, this tweet mentions the company's focus on AI and innovation. But without knowing where this company stands overall, it's hard to tell if this is a positive or negative factor. Maybe positive because they're moving into a tech area that's growing; but perhaps neutral if there are other factors I'm missing.

3. ""Enter a free round of stock trading competition on the stock exchange.""

This one is more about market competition. It's encouraging participants to trade, which can boost investor confidence and potentially increase sales. So this seems positive because it could drive demand for their stock as people take action.

4. ""The company has developed a new technology that could revolutionize the industry.""

Alright, here we have a clear statement about the company introducing new technology. This is definitely a positive factor because advancements in tech can lead to increased revenue and market presence. It's a strong indicator of future success.

Now, considering all four tweets:

1. Vague, unclear information without specific stock.
2. Limited context—just innovation focus, could be mixed.
3. Positive about increasing competition and growth.
4. Clear positive shift into new technology.

So putting it together: The third tweet is definitely positive because it's encouraging trading activity which benefits the company. The first tweet can't really affect the stock. The fourth one adds a solid driver of success. But the second tweet's sentiment isn't clear enough to determine much, but maybe neutral if it just states their focus without any predicting impact.

I think in this case, since the third and fourth tweets are decisive positives, they will tip the scale, making the overall sentiment positive."
2014-09-14,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets about the given stock symbols and determine their impact on the future stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, the target stock is either Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), or another company mentioned in the tweets. The user provided a sample tweet that includes all three companies: AT_USER, $ aapl, $ goog, $ bbry, $ msft, $ nok, $ sne, and $ alu.

Starting with the first tweet:
""rt AT_USER $ aapl $ goog $ bbry $ msft $ nok $ sne $ alu this world map shows every device connected to the internet URL""

This seems like a link or maybe a news about connected devices. The user is mentioning multiple companies in one tweet, which makes me think it's a significant event related to tech trends or market changes, possibly affecting stock prices.

Next tweet:
""rt Apple is on its way to becoming the smartest AI company ever created. Let’s check out the latest developments! Apple Inc. is on its way to become the smartest AI company ever created.""

This one directly mentions Apple and speculates about their AI advancements. It seems positive, suggesting they are likely improving or gaining favor in tech circles.

Third tweet:
""rt NVIDIA's first AI chip for gaming won't be out until 2034! The future of graphics processing unit (GPU) technology is bright.""

NVIDIA is known for GPUs used in gaming. This tweet suggests that their GPU chips will be launched later, which might drive stock prices as it relates to tech innovation.

Fourth tweet:
""rt NVIDIA's first AI chip for gaming won't be out until 2034! The future of graphics processing unit (GPU) technology is bright.""

Same as the third tweet; both tweets about NVIDIA's GPU chips being delayed. This seems positive, indicating potential growth in NVIDIA's stock.

Fifth tweet:
""rt Apple Inc. is on its way to becoming the smartest AI company ever created. Let’s check out the latest developments! Apple Inc. is on its way to become the smartest AI company ever created.""

This repeats a previous tweet about Apple's AI advancements, reinforcing the positive outlook for Apple.

Now, combining all these factors:

1. The user mentions connected devices and tech trends, which can affect multiple companies.
2. Apple's AI developments are expected to boost stock prices as they are innovative and in high demand.
3. NVIDIA is investing in GPUs, a sector that grows with technology advancements.
4. All tweets are pointing towards positive developments for these companies.

Considering the factors like innovation (AI, GPUs), market growth in tech, potential revenue increases from new technologies, it seems all these tweets suggest a favorable market environment and positive sentiment toward future stock prices.

Therefore, the overall sentiment should be positive."
2014-09-15,Positive,"Alright, I'm looking at these tweets about Google. The first tweet mentions Google unveiling a $105 smartphone in New Delhi. That sounds exciting and positive, especially since they’re going public or something. 

The second tweet has a bunch of prices and symbols: $fxe, $erbb, $xiv, $xli. These could be related to other products or services that might impact the company's revenue or stock price. It's hard to tell exactly what those represent without more context.

The third tweet says AT_USER is mentioning more than a game forcecraft and qcraft and minecrab. That seems unrelated because Google isn't related to video games or construction vehicles. Maybe it's a typo or some other company's tweets about their products?

So, putting it all together, the first tweet is clearly positive because of the big announcement and high stock price. The second tweet mentions various unrelated symbols which might affect revenue but aren’t directly tied to Google’s performance yet. The third tweet seems out of scope for a stock related analysis.

Therefore, I think the overall sentiment is Positive."
2014-09-16,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about Google's stock price impact. I'm not super familiar with all the terms here, but I'll do my best.

First, looking at each tweet one by one. The target stock seems to be Google, so I should probably pay attention when it comes up. 

1. The first tweet says ""google ' c ' : wants to teach programming to millions of american girls URL $ goog."" Hmm, that sounds like a marketing or promotional message about teaching kids coding. It might seem positive because the company could gain more customers, but I'm not sure if that directly affects their stock price.

2. The second tweet is ""AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER not achieve sup positioning to $ goog , $ fb , etc . alternative channels to customers proliferating."" It seems like the user isn't achieving their top positions in Google's valuation for Google, Facebook, and others. Also, there are more customer alternatives available. Maybe this shows that they're diversifying or looking elsewhere, which could be positive because it might reduce dependency on a single company.

3. The third tweet is ""what does the cto ( chief technology officer ) of the us do ? $ goog $ googl $ twtr URL via AT_USER."" It's talking about the CTO's role and mentions other companies' stock prices. Not sure what this means for Google, but maybe it's indicating an interest in tech or something else.

4. The fourth tweet is ""google ' c ' : facebook value tops $ 200bn as shares rise URL $ goog."" It looks like Facebook's valuation reached $200 billion and their stock price has risen. This could be a positive sign for Google if they're looking to expand into the U.S., which might drive up both Facebook and Google's prices.

5. The fifth tweet is "" $ brnw ran up 145 % so far today ! huge news : URL $ amzn $ mcox $ goog."" It seems like Amazon and Microsoft are doing well, and their shares have risen a lot. This could indicate positive news about their financial health or market sentiment.

6. The sixth tweet is "" $ dscr last trade click here : URL also see : $ sohu $ goog $ cste $ hkup ~."" It looks like the Daily Standard's stock price has increased, and they're seeing some positive news related to Google. This could be a sign that investors are watching Google closely.

Now, putting it all together. The tweets mention Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, and the Daily Standard increasing in price. That suggests positive developments across different sectors of the company. But I'm not sure if those factors directly relate to how Google's stock is going. It could be a mix of good news from related companies but might not be enough on its own.

I think it's leaning towards a Positive overall because there are signs of growth in other areas, which sometimes indicate that the broader market or sector is doing well, which can influence investor sentiment positively."
2014-09-17,Negative,"Alright, I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of Apple's stock, specifically [AAPL]. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet says that today's gains are negative and erases any previous positive trends. That sounds like a bad sign because it suggests that the market is down, which usually affects investors negatively.
2. The second tweet mentions Google's new features on YouTube, including disney, twitch, iheartradio, and drama. This could be good news for Google but not directly related to Apple's stock. I'll need to check how this might influence Apple if there are any connections, but it seems unrelated.
3. The third tweet talks about a sell order being executed at $10:08 on the exchange. SELL orders can have significant implications because they can limit price action or impact trading activity. This could be seen as negative for Apple if it's used to cut off trades that would otherwise prevent growth.
4. The fourth tweet mentions Maguba, an actor with no recognition, being discussed on Google's homepage. While this could be a positive or neutral indicator of market sentiment, it seems unlikely to directly impact Apple's stock performance unless there are specific connections in the company's strategy.
5. The fifth tweet talks about an Android One initiative affecting Samsung. This is a tech-related tweet but not directly related to Apple. I don't see a direct link here that would affect [AAPL].
6. The sixth tweet also mentions Google's Android One and Samsung, similar to the previous one. Again, no connection to Apple's stock.
7. The seventh tweet discusses life extension companies for employees, mentioning ABBA and Germany. While this could be positive or negative depending on context, it doesn't seem relevant to [AAPL].

Putting it all together, the main points are a significant negative event at time 3 regarding sell orders, followed by unrelated mentions of Google features and tech developments that don't directly relate to Apple. These could either lead to market volatility or cut off trading, which might negatively impact the stock price. However, without specific details on whether these events improve or hinder the company's prospects, it's hard to assign a precise sentiment. But overall, the negative event at time 3 seems like the most impactful factor."
2014-09-18,Neutral,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of Google or Apple. Let me start by going through each tweet one by one.

The first tweet says: ""google ' c ' : military intelligence collects tens of millions of pieces of information a day URL $ goog."" Hmm, so they're talking about collecting intelligence data and are giving a stock symbol, $ goog. I'm not sure what the message is here—maybe they're indicating something about the company's performance or strategy? Not sure yet.

The second tweet: ""google inc class c ( goog ) 584.77 $ goog ' fast money ' recap : the fed acts and the markets react at the street - URL."" This seems more positive. They mention that the fed acts, which is a negative term for the U.S. Fed policies, affecting the markets. But they're saying it's "" reacting at the street,"" maybe implying they'll react in some way? It doesn't look like a major concern or positive outlook yet.

The third tweet: ""apple or google - which do you prefer ? URL apple google $ aapl $ goog $ googl AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER."" This is more about a general preference between Apple and Google. There's no mention of stock performance or any positive/negative information related to the company, so I'm not sure how this affects either stock.

Looking at each tweet:

1. The first one is unclear—maybe it's just setting up something without giving context.
2. Second tweet has a number followed by some numbers and mentions Fed actions, but doesn't state anything about the stock price yet.
3. Third tweet is a general question without any stock-related info.

I don't see any positive or negative information in these tweets that would influence the stock prices. They're more like statements with no direct impact on the companies involved."
2014-09-19,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company, which in this case is Google (GOOG). Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, the user provided some information about how to analyze it. They mentioned identifying the target stock symbol and then breaking down each tweet into positive and negative factors. I think the target here is GOOG because that's the only word in the tweets related to Google.

Starting with the first tweet: ""$ goog & $ googl when the combined prices touch 1268.00 ish this will be a measured move target , purely technical no fundies."" It seems like it's offering a target price for GOOG and says it's a ""measured move,"" which makes me think it's about buying or maintaining a position. The phrase ""purely technical"" suggests they're focusing on the stock's technical aspects without any sentiment from fundiness, so that might indicate cautious optimism.

Next tweet: ""$ himx intraday news or guidance raise would be worthy of a high five to company management - quiet all the manipulators + algorithms $ goog."" It mentions HimaX and raises concerns about guidance or news affecting GOOG. The phrase ""quiet all the manipulators"" suggests that there's no major concern, which could mean they're cautious but maybe expecting some positive developments.

Third tweet: ""rt AT_USER androidl will feature out-of-the-box encryption $ goog URL URL."" This one talks about Android features with an eye on Google's URL service. It seems like it's mentioning something technical related to the platform and services provided by Google, which could be a good sign for investors looking at their ecosystem.

Fourth tweet: ""rt AT_USER largest internet companies in the world ( market cap ): google - $ 400b $ goog alibaba - $ 231b $ baba facebook - $ 200b $ fb tenc …"" This is a list of other major companies and their valuations. It seems like GOOG has high valuations, but it's comparing it to others in the same category, which could imply that investors are cautious about how much they should pay for GOOG relative to competitors.

Fifth tweet: ""rt AT_USER largest internet companies in the world ( market cap ): google - $ 400b $ goog alibaba - $ 231b $ baba facebook - $ 200b $ fb tenc …"" Similar to the fourth one, it's just repeating the same information about valuations. It doesn't seem to address GOOG specifically.

So summarizing each tweet:

1. Concerning a target price for GOOG.
2. Expressing uncertainty and expecting management guidance.
3. Mentioning Android encryption related services from Google.
4. Comparing GOOG's valuation with others in the same sector, but not directly mentioning it.
5. Replying to the same list of companies, without focusing on GOOG.

Overall, the positive tweet mentions a target price and technical aspects, which could be seen as bullish if they believe GOOG is positioned well. The negative tweets are more speculative or cautious, suggesting uncertainty about future performance. However, since many tweets are about other tech companies with high valuations, it might balance out in terms of sentiment.

But the fact that one tweet is about a target price suggests that there's some interest from investors looking to buy or hold. So the overall sentiment could be slightly positive because of this focus on the price target and technicals."
2014-09-20,Neutral,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of the company involved. The user provided three tweets and asked for an analysis of whether they're positive, neutral, or negative. They also gave a specific output format that requires me to choose one tag: [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative].

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the tweets:

1. The first tweet mentions $ baba $ bidu $ goog $ aapl $ amzn as something people are discussing. Since it's about a bunch of stocks and doesn't mention any specific company symbol like Apple (AAPL), Baidu (BID) or others, it seems incomplete. Without the stock name, I can't determine the sentiment.

2. The second tweet says ""important victory for google inc."" It mentions Google but doesn't specify which stock they're referring to. Google is a well-known company, and such a tweet would likely positively impact its stock price because it highlights a successful achievement or performance in their operations or market presence.

3. The third tweet also starts with $ elra closed up 288.89 % on over 315 million volume. This seems to be a typo because ""elra"" isn't a stock symbol I recognize, and the closing percentage is unusually high for an index or ETF compared to a single stock. This could imply significant gains in a stock but without context, it's hard to assess its impact.

Now, given that the first tweet doesn't provide a stock name, I can't make any judgments about the sentiment of those tweets. The second tweet suggests Google is doing well, which would likely be positive for their stock price. However, the third tweet seems off-topic and might not have a clear impact on the stock either.

Since one of the tweets lacks necessary information to assess its impact, I can't conclude a single overall sentiment. Therefore, it's safe to classify this as [Neutral] because without reliable data on at least one relevant tweet, there's no basis for positive or negative analysis."
2014-09-21,Neutral,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to analyze some tweets about stock price impact on a given company. They provided specific steps: first identifying the target stock symbol, then a detailed analysis of each tweet including factors and sentiment.

Looking at the tweets, I notice they all mention $ goog, which suggests they're targeting Apple Inc., since Google is often referred to as GOOG. The tweets are negative in nature, discussing how different enthusiasts are feeling about the stock's ability to appreciate. They seem more like a commentary or opinion piece rather than specific analysis.

I need to determine if these tweets will positively, neutrally, or negatively affect Apple's stock price. Considering they're general sentiments without any specific predictions or technical indicators, it's safe to assume each tweet is neutral in impact."
2014-09-22,Missing,File not found
2014-09-23,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company, specifically looking at the given tweets provided.

First, let's see what each tweet is saying. The first tweet is ""AT_USER $ goog"". This looks like it might be trying to indicate that the user is holding or has an account related to Google. It doesn't seem very specific or negative or positive; it could be vague about whether it's positive or neutral.

Now, I'm not sure how much weight this tweet carries on its own because it's incomplete and lacks context. Without more information, it's hard to determine the sentiment beyond the possibility of indicating a connection, but that's too vague for strong analysis.

Since there are only two tweets provided in the initial example, I'll focus just on those first. The user didn't provide more tweets, so I can't proceed further with the given data. If there were more tweets, I would analyze each one separately and then combine them to get an overall sentiment.

But as it stands, without additional context or information from other tweets, my analysis is limited. So, I'll stick to the initial response that concludes [Neutral] because only a couple of tweets are available."

2014-09-29,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of the company.

First, let's identify the target stock from the first tweet: ""goog short possibility $ goog URL"". It seems like it's about Google's stock, so that's our target.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet says ""goog short possibility $. Maybe we can hold this for now."" This is positive because it's suggesting a possible short position and even indicating holding the stock, which might be attractive to some investors looking for growth potential.

2. The second tweet starts with ""fbi director james comey ' very concerned ' about new apple , google privacy features "" and mentions $ appl $ goog snowden. It seems like it's discussing concerns related to Apple and Google's privacy features from the FBI. Since it's pointing out issues or regulations, this could be negative because investors might worry about potential regulatory scrutiny.

3. The third tweet is ""what does chief technology officer of the u . s . do $? $ googl $ twtr URL via AT_USER cto"". It asks a technical question about the CTO position from Google. This seems neutral as it's seeking information but not providing any positive or negative outlook.

Now, I need to combine these factors. The first tweet is positive, which might encourage some investors. However, the second tweet is negative due to concerns about privacy issues. The third tweet is neutral because it doesn't have a clear impact on stock price but asks for information. So overall, there's a mix of positive and negative sentiment.

The initial reaction from the user was [Neutral], suggesting that the analysis wasn't strong enough considering both positive and negative factors. But after looking at all tweets, I think the positive tweet might provide some insight or optimism about Google, while the negative tweet shows underlying concerns that could affect investor behavior.

Since there are conflicting signals—positive and negative—the overall sentiment isn't clear-cut. It's better to consider this as [Neutral] because it's a mix of positive and negative factors without a strong stance."
2014-09-30,Missing,File not found
2014-10-01,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets about Google and determine if they'll impact the stock price positively, neutrally, or negatively. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the user provided four tweets. I think each of them is a separate tweet that could influence investor sentiment towards Google. The goal is to look at each one, figure out if it's positive, negative, or neutral, and then see how they might affect the stock price in total.

Starting with tweet 1: ""danrocks : $ goog alot of talk going around about this one URL."" Hmm, that seems like a link. It says Dan Rock is $ goog, which probably means Dan Rock is associated with Google's stock or something similar. The rest of the sentence talks about lots of talk around this URL. I'm not sure what exactly this tweet is conveying. Maybe it's a sign that some investors are following Dan Rock, but without more context, it's hard to tell if it's positive or negative.

Next, tweet 2: ""$ goog is the new era $ ge - just a basket full of opportunities URL."" This seems like a comparison between Google and another company, possibly Tesla. It mentions opportunities and is linked with "" baskets,"" which makes me think it's about trends in tech or startups. If someone sees Google as a leader or leaderless company, that could be positive for investors. But I'm not entirely sure if that's a strong enough indicator yet.

Tweet 3: ""google inc class c ( goog ) 577.36 $ goog what's PayPal's first solo move ? by mae anderson - ap - 1 hr 32 mins ag URL."" This tweet is more technical. It mentions Google Inc being in class C status, which could indicate they're looking to increase their capitalization or expand into other areas. The part about PayPal's solo move is confusing because PayPal usually goes public via private offerings rather than a solo move. Maybe the user is trying to suggest that Google is taking another step forward or perhaps looking at a potential sale? The mention of ""1 hr 32 mins ag"" suggests it's not immediately clear what they're planning, but the overall tone seems positive since Google is often seen as an expanding company.

Tweet 4: ""rt AT_USER google has transformed itself many times in last decade . love this graphic . ' a decade of $ goog'."" This tweet uses ""rt AT_USER"" which might be referring to a Reddit username or a tag. It mentions Google transforming itself over the past decade, which could imply that it's experienced and growing. The mention of a graphic from 10 years ago shows some nostalgia but doesn't necessarily mean it's positive or negative on its own.

Now, putting this all together: tweet 3 seems to be more about business strategy and growth opportunities, which is generally good for the stock. Tweets 2 and 4 talk about trends and past experiences with Google, but without specific information on what those trends are doing, I can't say if they're positive or negative. Tweet 1 might just be a link or buzzword, which could cause some online discussions but not necessarily a clear trend.

So, considering the main tweet that stands out is tweet 3, it's positively impacting Google by suggesting they're expanding and looking for growth opportunities. Even though the others have mixed signals, I think the business expansion part dominates the overall sentiment."
2014-10-02,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the future stock price of a company. The user provided three tweets and specified to focus on the stock symbol extracted from them.

First tweet: $ goog online stock traders get their trading information here - no login required - URL. It mentions Google's stock but doesn't specify which stock. So, I don't have enough info here.

Second tweet: eric schmidt talks about rubber and glue in tech terms. This seems more like a casual comment without clear context or impact on stock prices.

Third tweet: rt AT_USER traders do not forget $ vstr - google / $ goog finance 50k every month . to vstr URL URL. Again, it mentions Google but doesn't specify the stock or any metrics related to performance.

Since I can't identify the exact target stock from the first tweet and lack context for the other two tweets, I'm unsure how these affect the stock price. There's no direct information about earnings, positive news, or market reactions. Therefore, my analysis is incomplete."
2014-10-03,Positive,"Okay, let's figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided four tweets, but they only mentioned a couple of them in my initial list. Let me start by looking at each tweet one by one.

The first tweet is: ""$ goog working on large-scale video displays, modular, can be any shape or size and fill a living room wall. URL via AT_USER."" So this is from AT_USER, probably an analyst or a financial professional. They mention that Google is developing video displays which can be modular and change the look of rooms. They're giving them to users.

The second tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ vstr $ goog .. backed URL / chain of command advisors to management / URL URL."" Hmm, this seems like an incomplete query. Maybe it's trying to get information about Google's future or current projects? It includes terms like 'vstr' and 'chain of command advisors', which might be related to the company's leadership or technical details.

The third tweet: ""rt AT_USER google's next big project : large-scale video displays . URL $ goog."" Again, this seems similar to the first one. It confirms that Google is developing these displays and gives them to users, just like the first tweet did.

The fourth tweet is: ""$ vstr $ goog .. backed URL / chain of command advisors to management / URL URL."" This looks even more like an incomplete query related to Google's projects or leadership positions. It's unclear what exactly it's conveying.

Now, considering all these tweets, they all discuss Google developing large-scale video displays and seem to be providing information on their projects or future plans. The first tweet mentions a live request for the displays via AT_USER, which might indicate that Google is in the process of making these purchases. The second and third tweets are partial queries, but given their structure, they likely contain relevant information about Google's projects.

From what I know, Google has been a major player in video display technologies, so tweets about new developments in this area would positively impact the stock price because it shows confidence in the company's future prospects. However, each tweet is somewhat vague and doesn't provide specific details that could lead to a clear conclusion.

I should consider whether the information provided in these tweets adds clarity or just sets up for more detailed discussions. Since all the tweets are about Google moving forward with new products or projects, especially related to video displays, they collectively suggest a positive outlook on the company's future.

Therefore, I'll conclude that each tweet contributes positively by indicating optimism about Google's potential developments in video display technologies, which can be seen as an indicator of future earnings and investor interest."
2014-10-04,Positive,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given tweet is positive, negative, or neutral regarding a company's stock price impact. The tweet says ""rt AT_USER google's next big project : large-scale video displays . URL $ goog"". Hmm, okay.

First, let me break down what this means. ""AT_USER"" seems to be a Twitter username that's linked with the company, which is Google. So, the user is probably referring to Google because of their name. The tweet mentions Google's next big project and specifically talks about large-scale video displays and uses a URL pointing to $ goog. I think $ goog might indicate stock price changes or something related.

I'm not entirely sure what ""next big project"" means here—maybe they're planning something significant that involves developing large screens for the company. The use of ""large-scale"" suggests they're aiming for major advancements in tech, which could be a positive sign because companies often show growth potential when they announce ambitious projects.

Looking at the factors, it's definitely positive because Google is involved and the mention of video displays points to innovation and expansion into new markets or products. The tweet seems to be providing information about their next project, which might attract investors looking for growth opportunities.

Now, assessing sentiment: the tweet mentions a ""next big project,"" which can imply anticipation and excitement. It suggests they're investing heavily in something promising. Investors often react positively to such signals because it indicates potential for strong returns. The fact that they're using $ goog could mean they might be updating their stock price or providing financial information related to their growth.

So, putting this together, the tweet is positive because it highlights a forward-looking project and shows interest in future growth. There's no indication of any negative thoughts or concerns here."
2014-10-05,Positive,"Alright, I need to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on a company's stock price. The tweet mentions Google plans to hire more security guards internally rather than outsourcing. That sounds like cost-cutting or cost-effective solutions. From what I know, companies that reduce their expenses can improve profitability and sometimes maintain or increase revenue. This suggests positive trends because it could lead to higher profits and better financial health. So overall, the sentiment is probably positive."
2014-10-06,Positive,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a set of tweets and wants to determine their likely impact on a company's stock price, specifically noting if it's positive, neutral, or negative. 

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at tweet 1: ""monitor your watchlist of assets for tweets - us tech giants URL $ msft $ twtr $ aapl $ fb $ goog"". Here, the target stock is MSFT, which is Microsoft.

Next, I'll analyze each tweet. The first one mentions monitoring a watchlist of assets and talks about tech giants like Facebook (FB), Google (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and others. It says ""URL $ msft"". I'm not sure what URL stands for in this context. It could be indicating that the tweet is related to Microsoft's stock price or perhaps a typo.

But looking at the output requirement, I need to consider each tweet's impact. The first tweet mentions tech giants, which are often related to growth stocks. So if it says ""monitor your watchlist of assets for tweets - us tech giants URL $ msft..."", maybe they're suggesting that their financial performance is being watched by tech experts, which could be positive because tech stocks tend to rise when companies grow.

However, the mention of MSFT without context isn't clear. If it's about Microsoft's stock price, then that would likely be a positive sign since stock prices are usually positive when investors see good earnings or other positive indicators. But if ""URL"" is a typo for something else, like 'URL' might stand for unrelated information, it could still contribute to the positive sentiment.

Considering all factors—tech giants and Microsoft's stock—it seems highly likely that these tweets will positively influence investor sentiment, leading to a favorable overall outcome."
2014-10-07,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for a given company. The user has provided four tweets, but they don't include the target stock symbol. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at tweet 1: ""$ googl $ goog 2 % down day"". Hmm, this seems like an email or a notification about the stock price dropping by 2%. It's quite specific and direct. The mention of ""down day"" might indicate that the stock has been experiencing positive news each day for several days.

Next is tweet 2: ""jnk stock chart $ jnk $ gdxj $ hxd.to $ goog URL URL"". This looks like a link or a reference to some stock chart data. I'm not sure what's being linked here. It could be part of a larger dataset or specific to the user's analysis. Since it's unclear, it's hard to assess its impact on sentiment.

Tweet 3: ""commented on stocktwits : i admit $ goog is not all that in all areas however the vision is clearer than $ aol & $ yh ... URL"". This tweet seems more reflective of opinions or analyses about $goog. The user is sharing their thoughts, which might influence other investors' opinions but doesn't provide specific information about the stock's performance.

Finally, tweet 4: "" samsung's issued a warning that it's q3 profits are kinda crummy - - actually , they're down 60 % "" $ goog $ aapl URL. This one is very detailed with specific warnings and percentages. It's clear that the company is underperforming in their third quarter, which could be seen as negative news.

Now, considering each tweet:

1. The email/tweet about a 2% drop might indicate that the stock has been performing well recently.
2. The chart link or data seems too vague without context to assess sentiment.
3. Stock comments and analysis are often speculative but can influence opinions on the company's performance.
4. The warning about Q3 profits is strong and negative, which directly affects investor sentiment.

Putting it all together: There's a mix of specific updates (1 and 4) that suggest positive news for the stock, while tweet 3 adds context without concrete data. However, tweet 4 provides substantial negative information about their financial performance. The overall sentiment might be mixed but leaning towards negative because of the detailed warning from a company they're associated with.

But I'm not entirely sure if the first tweet's 2% drop is significant enough to outweigh the detailed warning in tweet 4. It depends on how many days have passed since the last notification and how impactful each tweet was relative to the others."
2014-10-08,Neutral,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative for the stock price impact. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at tweet 1: ""how secure are your earnings data ? get the cryptophone > > URL $ jazz $ mxicy $ goog $ ala $ armhy $ astsf $ bcgi $ besi $ cdv $ dlgs"". Hmm, this seems to be a Twitter query asking about something. It looks like it's linking several words together and might be related to some sort of data or product. The mention of ""cryptophone"" and specific companies like jazz, mxicy, goog, etc., suggests they're querying data on those topics. Since tweets are about trends or queries rather than opinions, I'm not sure how this affects stock prices. Maybe it's a query that's relevant to the company, but without more context, it's hard to tell if that directly impacts the stock positively, neutrally, or negatively.

Now, tweet 2: ""rt AT_USER over 75 % of android smartphone sales in china now have 5 ' + screens ( via AT_USER $ aapl $ goog URL"". This seems like an RT message about Android smartphone sales in China. It mentions that 75% of users have more than 5 screens. The user also links to Apple and Google, which are major tech companies. If there's positive consumer sentiment from this tweet, it could boost the stock price by encouraging investors to buy. However, if it comes across as negative news about consumers or competition, it might affect the company negatively.

Considering both tweets together: The first one seems more speculative and possibly unrelated, while the second is a business-related query showing customer satisfaction with tech products. Combined, they might indicate positive sentiment, which could positively impact the stock. However, without knowing the exact content of the first tweet, it's hard to be certain. But overall, the second tweet suggests strong consumer demand for technology products, which could drive growth and thus a positive impact on the stock price."
2014-10-09,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out how to analyze the impact of these tweets on a given company's stock price based on their content. The user has provided two tweets and wants me to determine if they'll be positive, neutral, or negative towards that stock.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""google ' c ' : patent issued for detecting anomalous application access to contact information URL $ goog"". It starts with ""c"", which is a common abbreviation for ""contact."" The main content mentions a patent related to detecting abnormal access using a contact information URL. So, this seems like it's providing new information about an innovation or advancement in their technology. They're introducing something that can help detect stuff they thought was already there.

The second tweet is similar: ""google ' c ' : patent issued for text segmentation URL $ goog."" Again, the same structure and the intent seems positive because they're announcing a specific feature—text segmentation which likely enhances functionality or usability of their products.

Now, considering how tweets are typically interpreted in stock sentiment. Positive tweets about innovations or advancements usually boost investor confidence, which can lead to a positive stock outlook. Both tweets mention patent discoveries that could improve their business processes, which is a good sign for growth potential.

The words like ""contact information URL"" and ""anomalous application access"" might imply they're addressing security issues or improving accessibility, but without knowing the specific outcome of these patents, it's hard to say if they'll make or break news. However, since it's an announcement about a new feature, it suggests that their current operations are being enhanced.

Negative tweets usually target specific problems, like data breaches or security issues. Since neither of these tweets addresses any negative concerns, they seem neutral in intent here. Thus, considering the positive announcements and the lack of any negative intent, the overall sentiment is likely positive."
2014-10-10,Negative,"Okay, I need to figure out how these tweets impact the stock price of GOOG (Google). Let me start by looking at each tweet one by one.

First tweet: It talks about transaction costs and a URL spreadbetting thing with Google. Spread betting is a financial strategy where you bet on the volatility of an asset. While this might influence investor decisions, it's more about strategies than directly impacting the stock price.

Second tweet: This seems to be from Twitter (RT) and mentions something about the tspg management team devising a detailed operating plan for Google. This could be positive or neutral because it shows strategic planning which is often good for investors as it can guide investment decisions.

Third tweet: The user bought Tesla (TSLA) at 09:31 on sigma-x with a specific price range and made mentions of several financial indices and stock symbols like Aapl, nflx. This seems to be an explicit purchase action, which is definitely negative because buying stocks increases their value.

Fourth tweet: It's all about AT_USER repeated multiple times. Nothing stands out here—it might just be some random text or a test post without any meaningful content.

Fifth tweet: This says there will be notable earnings next week for several companies related to Google. Earnings reports can affect investor sentiment because they show the company's financial performance. If it's positive, especially regarding earnings, it could be a good sign. However, if it's negative or mixed, it might pull down the stock.

Sixth tweet: The CEO is criticizing payment companies (Co's) and mentioning retail deposits affecting bank ceos. It seems like this is a criticism of how other financial institutions are doing. Bank CEOs can have significant impacts on each other, especially in an economic downturn. If they're worried about their peers, it might reduce investor confidence, which could be negative.

Now, putting it all together: The third tweet is explicit buys which is definitely negative. The fifth tweet talks about earnings, which can be positive or negative but the context isn't clear. The sixth tweet is more criticism than indication of a positive impact. So, considering these points, I think there's an overall negative sentiment because of the purchases and potential impact from earnings reports."
2014-10-11,Missing,File not found
2014-10-12,Negative,"Okay, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on stock prices. The user provided three tweets and a sample output. I need to think through each tweet carefully.

First, looking at the target stock symbol in each tweet. In all three, it seems like ""dkcom"" is mentioned, which might be DkCom Inc., but without knowing its sector or current performance, it's hard to know if that affects things. So maybe focus on the sentiment rather than specific stock details.

Now, going through each tweet one by one.

The first tweet says: ""danrocks : $ hkup on radar $ goog $ uslv $ dgaz $ gdxj $ brzu URL"". The word ""hkup"" translates to Hong Kong dollar. I'm not sure how this relates to stock prices. It might be unrelated, maybe a typo or irrelevant information.

The second tweet is: ""trader shares what he did to make his first million trading starting from almost nothing URL $ fb $ twtr $ lnkd $ goog"". This seems like advice on trading strategies, but how does that affect stock prices? Trading advice isn't directly linked to market sentiment, so probably not influencing the overall stock price positively or negatively.

The third tweet: ""$ goog max pain is 567.50 for maturity 10/10 / 2014 . last close = 544.49 . URL"". It mentions Google's stock reaching a certain price on a specific date and the current price. This seems like a statement about the market, possibly predicting something. If it says ""max pain,"" maybe suggesting a significant correction is coming. That could be seen as negative news affecting investor confidence.

Putting it all together: the first tweet has no immediate impact. The second is irrelevant advice. The third one predicts Google's stock might drop, which would likely be negative for investors."
2014-10-13,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price of a company. The user provided three tweets and asked for an analysis of their impact on the stock's future price.

First, I need to understand what each tweet is saying. Let's look at them one by one.

1. The first tweet says ""$ goog / aapl / fb all positive."" Hmm, it mentions GOOG (Google), AAPL (Apple), and FB (Facebook). The word ""all positive"" makes me think that these stocks are expected to be doing well this week. Maybe they're seeing good news or earnings reports.

2. The second tweet says ""de las compañías listadas en el s & p500 se esperan reportes para esta semana de : $ jpm , $ c , $ blk y $ goog."" It starts by saying it's about companies in the S&P 500 that are expected to issue reports this week and mentions JPM, C, BLK (which I think is Bank ofkeystown? Maybe not, perhaps a typo for BOE or something else). Google seems again mentioned here. So this tweet is talking about financial statements being released.

3. The third tweet says ""$ goog - calendrier des sociétés sur 15 jours URL."" It mentions GOOG and talks about societal announcements over the next 15 days, provided by URLs. ""Sur"" means 'on' or 'during,' so this seems like they're talking about events happening in the future that might impact GOOG.

Now, putting it all together, each tweet is mentioning GOOG, Apple, Facebook, and financial reports from Google. The first two tweets are specifically about companies on the S&P 500 that expect to issue reports this week. The third one talks about upcoming societal events related to GOOG.

From what I know, GOOG is a major tech company with high stock prices. If they're expected to issue financial reports or if they're listed in financials, it can affect investor sentiment. Financial statements usually show earnings and other metrics that might indicate future performance.

But wait, the second tweet mentions JPM as well. I'm not sure what JPM is—maybe investment banks? But again, the main focus seems to be on GOOG being expected in reports and financials.

The third tweet suggests that something is going on with societal events related to GOOG over the next 15 days. If there are upcoming societal changes or announcements, it could affect investor confidence. However, unless those announcements are negative (like bad news for investors), they might not have a major impact.

Putting all these together, since the tweets mention GOOG's earnings and financial reports, which are typically important indicators of company performance, they might be positive factors. The mention of upcoming societal events is more speculative but could either help or hinder the stock price depending on what those events are.

However, given that it's about financial companies and their financial statements, I would lean towards a positive impact because earnings usually correlate with stock prices."
2014-10-14,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to analyze how these tweets impact the stock price for Google. Let me start by looking at each tweet one by one.

The first tweet says $ goog is a hot stock to watch with URL. That sounds positive because it mentions upcoming deliveries and the mobile challenge, which are related to growth in the tech sector. So that's a good sign.

Then there are two more tweets where AT_USER from Analyst predicts Google will be the first $1 trillion company by market cap. This seems like a very strong statement about potential growth, which is positive for investors who expect significant capitalization gains.

Looking at the last tweet, it's a repetition of the previous one, so no new information there. It reinforces the idea that Google is ahead in market cap.

All tweets highlight positive trends related to company expansion and growth potential. There are no negative comments or warnings about issues. The lack of neutral or negative sentiment means overall this seems promising."
2014-10-15,Neutral,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on a stock's future price. I have two tweets to analyze.

First tweet: ""$ live and $ goog are ripe picks right now . see why now URL""

I need to extract the target stock from this tweet. The words ""live"" and ""goog"" come up, so it seems like the stock symbol is GOOGL or G. That makes sense because these are common symbols for Google.

Next step is a tweet-by-tweet analysis. Let's separate positive and negative factors.

Positive factors might be things that support the stock, like good company fundamentals. The mention of ""goanna"" could mean ""good,"" but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Also, ""see why now URL"" suggests something related to investing or updating info, which is a common way for investors to stay informed.

Negative factors might include things that suggest the stock isn't good or will suffer. But in this tweet, there's no negative information like bad news about the company or negative market sentiment mentioned elsewhere.

So, looking at positive factors: ""live and goog are ripe picks"" could be indicating potential buy signals from others. The ""see why now url"" part might mean that the stock is moving or relevant now. These points indicate support but aren't strong enough to negate any negative thoughts about the stock's future performance.

Putting it together, the tweet seems to be providing information and suggesting that the stock is in good shape, which could indicate positive sentiment towards it. However, without specific details on company performance metrics like revenue or earnings, I can't make a definitive judgment on the overall impact.

So, considering all this, the overall sentiment is probably neutral because while there's some positive information about the stock being ""ripe,"" it doesn't outweigh any negative factors that might be implied but aren't explicitly stated."
2014-10-16,Neutral,"Alright, let's try to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the company in question. So, I'm looking at 21 tweets related to Google's earnings for the third quarter.

First, each tweet is a separate event or news item that affects investor sentiment. I need to analyze each one to see if it contributes positively, neutrally, or negatively to the stock.

Starting with tweet 1: It mentions that $QQQ (which stands forQQQ, the Dow Jones Industrial Average) broke a level and talks about several stock prices dropping. This seems like good news because lower stock prices can make investors buy more, increasing demand. That's positive.

Tweet 2 is about the S&P Movers index, which is the benchmark for the market. It mentions some percentage changes in individual stocks relative to the overall index. If the S&P Movers index itself is strong, it could indicate that the broader market is doing well, which can be positive for investors looking at the whole market.

Tweet 3 talks about Google's earnings call after the close on October 16th. It mentions some news related to their revenue. The fact that they're making an announcement and talking about their performance shows consistency in their reporting, which might be seen as stable news, contributing positively to investor confidence.

Tweets 4-7 are repeated mentions of Google increasing their revenue without meeting expectations. This seems like a consistent pattern where the company reports higher-than-expected earnings, which can affect investor sentiment by making them think that they're on the right track or that the market has good news coming in.

Tweet 8 is another repetition, reinforcing the idea of increased revenue. It's important to note that just because something happens doesn't mean there are no other factors influencing it—like if Google is facing some challenges.

Tweets 9-12 mention futures volatility based on whether Google meets its earnings targets or not. If they miss their target, that can affect investor confidence and could lead to a swing in stock price. This adds another layer of uncertainty, which might be negative for the stock but depends on how the market reacts.

Tweet 10 talks about futures being volatile because Google misses beats or if it's beating expectations. This suggests that Google is likely to experience some price movements, potentially affecting their stock price. It could be a mix of positive and negative news depending on whether they meet targets.

Tweets 13-14 discuss Google's spending pressures on EPS and click growth slowing. These are important trends because if earnings go up despite lower clicks, it might indicate that the market is bearish or investors are more risk-averse. This can lead to a negative sentiment for the stock price.

Tweet 15 talks about Google's earnings disappointment but with positive outlooks. While there was some confusion due to missing beats, the fact that they're making progress could still be seen as a mixed signal, contributing to uncertainty but also positive because it shows progress and potential recovery.

Tweets 16-20 are all about Google increasing their headcount and confirming earnings results live. The specifics here might show consistency in reporting which can be good for investors looking at the company's operations.

Putting this all together, there seem to be a mix of positive and negative trends. While some tweets like tweet 1 and 3 highlight improved market conditions, others show increased earnings and spending pressures that could lead to volatility. There's also mixed results around how well Google is meeting their targets—both successes and missteps. The overall sentiment seems uncertain because the impact can vary depending on how investors react to each piece of information. However, there are signs of growth and improvement that might contribute to a positive outlook for the stock price."
2014-10-17,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price. First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Let's go through them one by one.

1. The first tweet says ""rt AT_USER new post : crapped out again URL $ goog $ iwm $ nflx $ qqq $ spy."" So the symbol here is SPY, which is part of S&P 500. I know SPY tends to be fairly stable but can go up or down.

2. The second tweet mentions "" $ twtr beats $ goog , $ fb & $ aapl to lead the elite list of top companies URL URL."" So again, SPY is involved here too. I remember SPY could be volatile, so this might affect its price.

3. The third tweet starts with ""check out this big trader in the news ! URL $ esi $ hdsn $ coco $ biof $ fb $ twtr $ goog."" This includes SPY, so again focusing on SPY's sentiment.

4. The fourth tweet says ""$ goog received a new alert . find out why at stocks daytrading trading mkt nyse nasdaq markets 585."" It doesn't mention the stock symbol, but ""goog"" is part of the stock name. I'm not sure what ""goog"" refers to; maybe it's Google itself or something else.

5. The fifth tweet talks about Google's performance with a max pain figure and close prices. It mentions NYSE and NASDAQ markets. Since it's about Google, SPY might be affected positively if they're looking good for trading.

6. The sixth tweet is ""wow , great stock research on $ slab $ enh $ str $ goog must see URL URL."" This includes Google as well, so again, SPY's sentiment is in question.

7. The seventh tweet mentions Zavo and XEPO, which are related to Google but not the target symbol here. Maybe that's a distraction.

8. The eighth tweet says ""google missed on earnings and revenue - $ googl $ goog."" Here it's explicitly about Google's financials, so this directly affects Google.

9. The ninth tweet is similar, mentioning Google missing earnings: ""$ googl $ goog."" So positive or negative impact based on their profit.

10. The tenth tweet talks about Google fear and a comment from Jeremy Rosenberg: ""jeremy rosenberg : fear not googlars , google inc ( googl ) shall rise."" This is from Google, so it directly affects their stock price.

Now, I need to determine the sentiment of each tweet towards SPY. Since SPY's performance is tied closely with Google and related companies, all tweets that mention these could be significant.

Looking at the mentions:
- The fourth tweet is about Google's alert but doesn't specify if they're worried or happy.
- The fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth tweets are directly discussing Google. The ones from 7 and 9 might have positive earnings reports, which would boost SPY.

Considering that the other tweets like 1,2,3,6 mention SPY but don't provide a clear trend (up or down), it's hard to gauge a strong sentiment yet. However, the most impactful ones are 5,8,9,10. The positive ones from these tweets could push SPY up, especially if Google is doing well.

But without concrete information on specific trends or any contradicting statements, I can't say for sure. So I should conclude based on the strongest indicators—like the positive comments and earnings reports—and state that there's some uncertainty but potential for positive impact."
2014-10-18,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the given company. The tweets are from 10 different sources, but each seems relevant and provides information about Google's financial status or outlook.

Starting with the first tweet: ""since the start of the decade , google has paid out nearly $50 billion to websites running its adsense network . $ goog"". This seems like a financial statement. It mentions Google spending money on ads, which is typical for any company. Spending can be seen as an investment in their ad ecosystem, potentially affecting their revenue and future performance.

The second tweet: ""rt AT_USER the growth of google's money machine may be slowing : URL $ goog"". This uses Twitter handle AT_USER to make a comment about Google's money machine. If this is just a random retweet or comment without specific context, it might not have a significant impact on the stock price.

The third tweet: ""http://www.glass-leaf.co.uk/?q=goo glg : gpx"". This looks like an unrelated link to Glass-Leaf Co., which isn't mentioned in any other tweets. It's probably another random tweet without direct information about Google or the company, so it doesn't seem impactful.

Putting this together, the first tweet is providing a financial update, which could be positive if it's seen as a long-term view of the company's stability. However, Twitter's platform can vary in interpretation. The second tweet seems too speculative and unrelated to any specific company or stock mentioned elsewhere. The third tweet doesn't add any relevant information.

Considering all three tweets, the first one is informative but not a direct mention of the stock price. It might be seen as positive by investors who notice the trend of Google's financial health. However, without additional context from other tweets like the second one, which lacks clarity and relevance, it's hard to make a strong assessment.

The other two tweets don't add meaningful information about the company or its future performance. They could potentially be irrelevant to any stock analysis unless there's some underlying theme I'm missing, but based on the given content alone, none seem to directly impact the stock price significantly."
2014-10-19,Positive,"Alright, I need to figure out how the given tweet affects the stock price of a company. The tweet mentions that an analyst predicts Google will be the first $1 trillion company by market cap and compares it to Apple. It also uses ""not apple"" in the quote.

First, I'll extract the target stock symbol from the tweet: it's not explicitly stated, but since it's about Google (GOOGL), that's my target here.

Next, I need to analyze each tweet factor. The tweet is a statement with positive and negative elements. It says ""an analyst predicts Google will be the first $1 trillion company by market cap"" – this seems like a positive note because it highlights Google's potential size. Then it mentions ""compared to Apple,"" which is a neutral point since they are both tech giants.

The phrase ""not apple"" is used as a contrast, but I don't think that changes the overall sentiment much. The main points are about Google being ahead in market cap and the comparison with Apple.

Now, assessing the sentiment: it's mainly positive without any negative elements overriding this. So, the overall impact should be positive."
2014-10-20,Positive,"Alright, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the given company. The user provided specific steps, so let me follow them.

First, I have to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking through the tweets:

1. ""bullish set-ups for monday URL other stocks to watch $ nlnk $ msft $ len $ phm $ adsk $ cuda $ tmus $ gpro $ goog $ f c bac baba"" – The target could be any of these companies, but since they all seem related to tech or financials, maybe it's something like AMZN.
2. ""big trader in the news ! URL $ scok $ leds $ esi $ kwk $ fb $ twtr $ goog we nailed ibio ! !"" – This seems focused on Google as well.
3. ""$ goog $ googl news : hey google , thanks for nothing $ goog google $ googl … "" – Again, targets Google.
4. ""rt AT_USER one analyst predicts google , not apple , will be the first $ 1 trillion company by market cap : URL $ goog $ aapl"" – This is definitely targeting Google and Apple.
5. ""$ goog max pain is 552.50 for maturity 10/18 / 2014 . last close = 519.65 ."" – The target here might be related to Google's stock price, possibly in the tech sector.
6. ""$ goog $ googl news : growth at google slows to a standstill $ goog google … "" – This also targets Google.
7. ""$ aapl getting the edge on payment over $ goog by marketing privacy trust."" – Targets Apple and Google for their marketing strategies.
8. ""after massive gains on penny stock picks , another new pick is coming ! check it out : URL $ amzn $ mcox $ goog""

Now, I need to analyze each tweet's factors:

1. For each tweet, identify Positive or Negative factors related to the target company (AMZN, GOOGL, Apple).
2. Assess sentiment based on the content and timing of these tweets.

Let's go through each one step by step.

1. **Bullish set-ups for other stocks**: This is a positive indicator that others might react positively about something.

2. **Focus on Google**: Positive or Neutral? The mention of ""nail it"" suggests success, which could be positive sentiment.

3. **Hey Google thanks**: Positive; it's a positive note.

4. **Analyst predicting Google will be the first trillion company**: Positive news; this is a strong signal for investors.

5. **Google max pain number and close price**: Negative or Neutral? The number 552 is in dollars, but since it's related to stock prices, I need to check if it's positive or negative. A high price number might indicate concern, but without knowing the benchmark, it's uncertain. However, a decrease could be neutral.

6. **Growth slowing**: This is negative news; it suggests that Google's performance isn't as strong as expected.

7. **苹果比谷歌更有优势**: Positive; Apple is making an effort to lead Google in certain areas, which is good for investors.

8. **Massive gains on penny stocks and new pick coming**: Positive signals about other companies, but not directly about AMZN or GOOGL.

Now, let's assess each tweet's sentiment:

1. Positive
2. Neutral
3. Positive
4. Positive
5. Neutral (depends on the number)
6. Negative
7. Positive
8. Neutral

Overall, there are multiple positive tweets, some negative, and several neutral ones. However, the most impactful factors seem to be the analyst predictions and the positive set-ups, which can make a big difference in stock price.

Given that Google is making important moves towards Apple, such as leveraging their payment strategy, this could drive demand for both companies, which might benefit AMZN's stock. The negative tweet about growth slowing affects Google, but if others are performing well (positive set-ups), the overall sentiment leans positive.

So, considering the balance of factors and the strongest indicators, I would conclude that the impact is Positive."
2014-10-21,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of AT_USER. First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at each tweet, it seems like they're referring to Apple Inc., so I'll use ""GOOGL"" as the target.

Next, I have to break down each tweet to identify Positive and Negative factors. For example, in the first tweet, there's a link to AT_USER but it mentions greening the grid using renewable energy investments by leaders like Google, which might be positive for their portfolio. The user is requesting more investment, so that could indicate some positive sentiment about their strategy.

The second tweet from the same user says Google decided not to exercise an option related to additional investment, which would probably decrease investor confidence. That's a strong negative factor.

In the third tweet, there are mentions of new cases in AT_USER's portfolio, but since it refers to $ mara and others with $ goog, this seems like a neutral or slightly positive note about their portfolio being updated.

The fourth tweet talks about Apple Pay targeting iTunes and another moat. It looks like Google is trying to enhance their product offerings, which could be seen as a strategic move that might positively affect the stock price by expanding their market reach.

Now, I need to assess how each tweet affects investor sentiment. The first two tweets seem contradictory because one says they want more investment while another says they won't exercise it. This inconsistency is problematic and can lead to uncertainty about the company's future plans, which is a negative impact on the stock price.

The third tweet mentions new cases but doesn't provide clear information on their quality or impact, so it might be a neutral factor.

The fourth tweet suggests enhancing product offerings for Apple Pay, which could open up new markets and increase revenue. This is likely to be positive.

Considering all these factors: two conflicting tweets about investment decisions, one neutral about portfolio updates, and one strategic enhancement. The conflicting information from the first two tweets creates uncertainty, which typically leads to a negative sentiment towards the stock price because investors can't form a clear view of the company's future performance."
2014-10-22,Negative,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on Google's stock price. Let me go through each tweet one by one and analyze their potential effects.

First tweet: $ goog - himax : Google decides not to make an additional investment in the display unit URL. This seems like a negative sign because Google might be reducing its spending, which could affect its operations and profitability. If they cut costs or don't invest as much, it could lead to lower revenues, possibly impacting their stock price negatively.

Second tweet: on 1 hand $ goog ownership was not favorable for himx with competitors. Then there's a mention of shareholder interest in receiving lots of info to desire something. This sounds more positive because having investor interest and access to information can boost company value. It might indicate that Google is working towards better customer experiences or improving their product, which could be a good sign.

Third tweet: rt AT_USER trouble ahead for google : the ad dollars are moving away from search URL $ goog. The user is expressing concern about potential issues with Google's advertising budget focusing too much on search instead of other areas like tech innovation or marketing. This could affect their ability to innovate and potentially lower future earnings, which might lead to a negative impact on the stock price.

Fourth tweet: $ goog - u . k . seeks help from tech firms in combating extremism online URL. The user is seeking assistance, which could be seen as positive because it shows Google looking out for others' needs or challenges. This might indicate improved community engagement and support for diversity, which can boost their brand reputation and future performance.

Fifth tweet: rt AT_USER trouble ahead for google : the ad dollars are moving away from search URL $ goog. Similar to tweet three, this indicates a shift in Google's advertising budget towards other areas rather than sticking with search. This could lead to lower revenue streams or reduced innovation potential, potentially affecting their stock price negatively.

Now, combining these thoughts: The first tweet clearly states a reduction in investments, which is negative. However, the third and fifth tweets suggest that Google might be diversifying their ad dollars away from search, which could hurt them. The second and fourth tweets are more about positive aspects like improving customer interactions or seeking help to sustain community needs.

Considering all these factors—both negative actions related to ad spending and a reduction in investments—it seems like there's an overall negative impact. However, the third tweet is the most concerning because it directly mentions the shift away from search, which would likely have a more significant effect on Google's performance."

2014-10-24,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze the given tweets to determine their impact on the future stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock from each tweet. The user provided three tweets with URLs but didn't specify which stocks they belong to. Without knowing the exact stock symbol, it's hard to assess its performance. So, maybe I can look for common symbols or see if there are any patterns in their content that might indicate a particular sector.

Looking at tweet 1: ""check out this big trader in the news ! URL $ amda $ gimo $ bjri $ soda $ fb $ twtr $ goog"". This mentions multiple companies like Amanda, Gimo, Bjri, Soda, FB, and Google. It's more general and seems to be providing information about several companies without indicating a specific stock.

Tweet 2: ""amazon fire phone flops 'show of hands : surprised ?' $ amzn $ aapl $ goog $ msft URL"". This tweet is critical about Amazon's Fire Phone and mentions its flopping, which I think means it didn't perform as expected. It uses the word ""flops"" to express disappointment or surprise. It also includes the stock symbols for Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft.

Tweet 3: ""rt AT_USER here's why you should buy apple and sell google - URL via AT_USER $ aapl $ goog"". Here, the user is encouraging purchasing Apple and selling Google. The URL part might be irrelevant unless it links to specific stocks or mentions something else about them. The tweet seems to be promoting a strategy where one buys Apple and sells Google.

Now, since I don't know which company the first tweet refers to, I'll focus on the second tweet as it's more specific. It talks about Amazon's Fire Phone flopping and expresses disappointment with it. This could imply investor sentiment is negative regarding Amazon's product performance. The phrase ""show of hands"" often reflects frustration or surprise.

In tweet 3, the user is promoting a stock-purchasing strategy for Apple and selling Google, which might suggest that some investors expect positive changes in their stocks. However, if the initial tweet isn't about Apple but another company, this could be misleading.

Putting it all together: the second tweet's negative comment about Amazon's Fire Phone might indicate investor concern, leading to potential negative sentiment towards the stock mentioned there. The third tweet is speculative since it's unclear which companies are being discussed beyond Google and Apple.

Since only one of the tweets provides specific information about a company (tweet 2), I'll focus on that. The fact that Amazon is being criticized could mean investors worry about their performance, which might negatively impact the stock price.

Therefore, considering tweet 2 alone, the overall sentiment would be Negative."
2014-10-25,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me start by looking at each tweet separately.

The first tweet mentions Google's sundarpichai taking more products under his wing URL and changing the price from $ goog. This seems like an announcement about product expansion or updates, which usually could be positive if it brings new opportunities for investors. So that's a positive factor.

Now, the second tweet says that Apple is buying Google and selling off Google in exchange for apple money and then listing itself as AT_USER on Google. Hmm, this sounds like Apple is acquiring Google via payment, which would likely increase Google's valuation. But wait, if Apple owns a portion of Google, how does that affect Google? It depends on terms of the acquisition. If it's a buyout, maybe investors see Google as cheaper or more accessible, but I'm not sure about the implications for the stock price itself.

I should also consider if these tweets are related to specific companies. The first tweet could be related to Apple (AAPL) since sundarpichai is part of Apple, and goog might refer to Google. The second tweet mentions apple and sells Google's assets but doesn't specify the company names much beyond ""apple.""

So, the first tweet affects Apple's position, while the second affects a different company that could be related or unrelated. Both tweets are positive in terms of announcements, which generally can boost stock prices. However, without more context on how these impacts affect specific stocks and considering possible market reactions, it's hard to say definitively. 

Given that both factors are positive, I'll lean towards [Positive]."
2014-10-26,Positive,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user provided a list of trade instructions and some output requirements. My task is to analyze the sentiment based on these instructions.

First, I notice that each line in the trade instructions seems to be about trading specific stocks or platforms with certain parameters like stop-loss levels, stop-percentage, position size, and broker choice. All these are about making profitable trades by leveraging existing platforms for tech giants.

Looking at the output requirements, it's clear that I need to conclude the overall sentiment of all these trades using one of three tags: Positive, Neutral, or Negative. So, essentially, every single trade instruction provided is part of the same overall transaction.

I should check if there are any negative elements in these instructions. All of them mention stop-loss levels and a 75% reduction on an investment, which is typical for profitable trades with leverage. There's no mention of losses or losses being incurred, so I don't see any negative behavior here.

Therefore, since all instructions are about making safe, profitable trades, the overall sentiment should be positive. Even though each individual trade might involve specific platforms, the core goal remains to make a profitable position on tech companies like MSFT, TWTR, AGLP, FB, and GOOG through trading."
2014-10-27,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether these tweets will affect the stock price of a company. The user provided two tweets and asked for an analysis on their impact using [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll start by identifying the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""$ goog trix cross soon . i will play it this week."" It mentions thegoog trux index and suggests a Google video game crossover. The second tweet is about ""ok google "" ads for APlas and Android, with some talk of a sunset time ad targeting sunsets.

The target stock here seems to be Apple (AAPL), given the words in both tweets.

Now, I need to analyze each tweet separately. Starting with the first one: ""$ goog trix cross soon . i will play it this week."" The user is talking about something related to Google's performance, specifically mentioning a crossover event for their game chip and suggesting a video game. This could influence investor sentiment positively because a positive event can boost stock prices.

Moving on to the second tweet: ""i'm watching cbs and $ goog "" ads for APlas and Android. The user is discussing Google's ad campaigns targeting Android phones, which might affect Apple's product demand. This could lead to increased sales or investments in Apple products, thus positively impacting their stock price.

Putting it together, both tweets are about positive developments related to Apple, either a crossover event or an advertising campaign aimed at their target market. These signals suggest a positive outlook on Apple's future performance."
2014-10-28,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze the given tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. 

1. ""susan wojcicki wants to sell you youtube video subscriptions | re / code URL $ goog"" - Hmm, this one doesn't mention any specific stock symbols or identifiers, so maybe it's referring to Google?
2. ""autonomous navigation is potentially huge for $ goog stocktoberfest"" Again, just ""$ goog"", which could be Google.
3. ""free weekly options scanner on high beta stocks $ yhoo $ gild $ goog $ pcln $ l locus URL"" This also mentions $ goog and some other companies.

So I think all the tweets are related to Google. That makes it easier to focus on those tweets.

Next, for each tweet, I need to identify Positive and Negative factors. Let's take them one by one.

1. ""susan wojcicki wants to sell you youtube video subscriptions | re / code URL $ goog"" – The mention of selling YouTube subscriptions suggests customer dissatisfaction or potential revenue loss. This could lead to a negative sentiment in the stock.
2. ""autonomous navigation is potentially huge for $ goog stocktoberfest"" Autonomous systems can be a positive factor if they improve efficiency, safety, or innovation. It might boost investor confidence.
3. ""free weekly options scanner on high beta stocks $ yhoo $ gild $ goog $ pcln $ l locus URL"" Free weekly options and investments in high-beta stocks. High-beta stocks often involve risky ventures, which can be volatile and may lead to negative sentiment.

Now, assessing the sentiment for each tweet:
1. The mention of selling YouTube suggests a potential decline in demand or market share, leading to a Negative sentiment.
2. Autonomous systems are generally seen as beneficial, so this tweet could be Positive.
3. High-beta stocks often carry risks that might reduce investor confidence, making this tweet Negative.

Combining these, I have two Negative and one Positive factor. It seems the overall impact is mixed but leans towards negative because while Autonomous systems are positive, the mention of YouTube sales and high-risk stocks (beta stocks) contribute to uncertainty.

So, considering all these points, I think the overall sentiment would be Negative."
2014-10-29,Neutral,"Okay, I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user has given me 8 tweets about different topics like technical observations, subscription services, corporate tax landscapes, and a penny stock pick.

First, for each tweet, I should separate them into positive and negative factors. Then, assess if they're positive or negative based on the sentiment. Finally, combine these to get an overall sentiment.

Starting with tweet 1: ""technical observation of the day : back above the 20dma on google $ goog URL"". This seems like a technical note from Google, so it's likely neutral because it's not directly about the stock but more about something else in the tech space. So it might be considered neutral.

Tweet 2: ""rt AT_USER youtube is considering offering paid , ad-free subscriptions to generate more revenue . URL $ goog"". The RT suggests it's real and the user is making a recommendation. It mentions generating revenue, which could be positive if it affects subscriber numbers or user engagement. But since it's about subscription services, I'm not sure yet; it might balance things out.

Tweet 3: ""youtube is considering offering a paid , ad-free subscription . could mean competition for vimeo . $ goog $ iaci URL"". It talks about competition, which could be either positive or negative depending on context. If it's more of a competitive move to attract users, maybe positive, but if the market is saturated, it might be neutral.

Tweet 4: ""youtube is considering offering paid , ad-free subscriptions to generate more revenue . URL $ goog"". Similar to tweet 2, it's about increasing revenue from subscriptions. It doesn't mention anything else related to the stock, so likely neutral again.

Tweet 5: ""switzerland joins new global corporate tax landscape URL $ aapl $ goog $ googl $ sbux"". This is about joining a new market or product (maybe app), which could be positive if it's expanding into a new sector but might have other implications in the stock. It could be moderately negative, depending on how that affects the overall company.

Tweet 6: ""for the love of god the nexus 6 scarcity is a sham people . its a marketing ploy to make the phone seem even more popular . $ goog can suck it"". This seems very negative. The user is critical of the company's product and claims it's promoting competitors. It could be very negative, but I'm not sure if that's relevant to a specific stock.

Tweet 7: ""apple looks to sell iphone in iran . $ aapl , $ fb , $ goog . URL URL"". This mentions Apple selling an iPhone in Iran, which is a bit off-topic unless it affects the company. It might be neutral because it's unrelated unless there are other implications elsewhere.

Tweet 8: ""major new penny stock pick coming today ! get the exclusive first look : URL $ cbl $ goog $ bll"". This seems like a call to action for an investment, possibly promising something positive if it makes people buy. However, it's just a recommendation without details, so it might be moderately negative because it could drive prices up but is also vague.

Now, combining all these: some tweets are about stock-related companies (tweets 1-4), others are more general (tweets 5-8). The overall sentiment seems to lean positive in some areas like tweet 7 if it's a positive sell, and negative in others. But overall, it looks balanced with both positives and negatives.

I'm leaning towards [Neutral] because the tweets cover various topics that might influence each other but don't all point in the same direction."
2014-10-30,Positive,"Okay, let's see. The user wants me to analyze some tweets about the stock price of a company and determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, looking at each tweet: 1 is about Google quelling concerns with their new URL, 2 mentions $ goog furthers its investment in iot and nest buying a startup called revolv. That sounds like they're investing more and possibly increasing their focus on the tech sector. 

Then there's 3 where Starbuck's, Amazon, and Google are accused of being 'immoral.' Wait, that seems off. I mean, isStarbucks or Amazon considered immoral? No, both are companies that make money for other companies. Maybe it's a typo or a sensitive statement. I should treat this as neutral because it's about their reputation but not the financial health.

The fourth tweet mentions FNMA asking to invest in $ goog and also sees dia and slv stocks. That could be seen as cautious, like holding onto shares rather than buying them immediately. So that might lean towards negative sentiment if there's concern about the company's performance.

Finally, the fifth tweet is a buy recommendation on Etoro for $ goog stocks. If someone recommends buying stock, that usually indicates positive sentiment because they're looking to capitalize on gains.

So putting it all together: the first tweet is positive as they're talking about concerns being quelled. The second is positive investment in tech companies. Third tweet's content doesn't seem relevant or negative. Fourth suggests caution but might be a bit of an indicator for cautious buying, which could add some negativity. Fifth clearly mentions buying, so that adds another push toward positive sentiment.

I need to weigh these factors. Some are definitely positive like the first two tweets and the fifth. The third is neutral because it's about reputation not financials. The fourth suggests a cautious approach but could still be seen as slightly negative if there's uncertainty. But overall, the dominant factors seem strong in positives, so I'll go with [Positive]."
2014-10-31,Positive,"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I have to analyze the impact of these tweets on the future stock price of a company and then determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative.

First, I need to identify which tweet refers to which stock symbol. That seems straightforward since each tweet mentions a stock name. So, let me go through them one by one:

1. The first tweet says ""$ fuel chatter of $ goog bid"". Hmm, ""fuel chatter"" doesn't ring a bell as a market-related term. Maybe it's a typo or irrelevant information.

2. The second tweet is ""$ trx $ aapl $ goog"". There's no mention of a company name here—maybe this isn't the stock I'm looking for since there's no symbol provided. I need to figure out which tweets are about actual stocks.

3. Third tweet: "". AT_USER ... with 84 % smartphone market share"". This seems like it could be referring to an app or service related to Apple, maybe ""AT_USER"" stands for Apple. The mention of the smartphone market share suggests that this is an Apple-related tweet.

4. Fourth tweet: ""hello moto ' set to return china market URL $ 0992 $ goog $ 0941 $ 0728 $ 600050"". This looks like a specific stock's price information, possibly for MySQL (MySQL stock).

5. Fifth tweet: ""$ ilmn stock forum click here : URL also see : $ goog $ smn $ fcel $ f ~"". The term ""ilmn"" is unclear and doesn't refer to any known company.

6. Sixth tweet: ""$ goog online stock traders get their trading information here - no login required - URL"". This is clearly an Apple stock since it's related to Google (the company) in the context of their services.

7. Seventh tweet: ""google ' c ' : youtube now supports 60fps super fluid video playback URL $ goog"". Again, this mentions YouTube and its streaming capabilities, so it probably refers to an Apple app or service like Airplane or something similar, but I'm not sure if that's a real company.

Now that I have some stocks identified: APlp (Apple), MySQL, and maybe another related to Airplane or another tech product. But for the purpose of this analysis, perhaps I should focus on the ones clearly mentioned in the tweets.

Next step is to look at each tweet for positive or negative factors. Let's go through them:

1. ""fuel chatter"" might indicate customer demand, which could be positive but not specific enough.
2. No stock name here, so I can't analyze this one.
3. 84% smartphone market share—this suggests strong interest in mobile services, which is good for app performance or revenue.
4. Chinese market information with multiple numbers—could be a stock's price update, maybe MySQL stock since the numbers look like dividends or share prices over time.
5. Clicking on a forum about ilmn and see a URL related to Google—maybe irrelevant or no immediate impact.
6. Trading info for Google (app) in the stock market without login—it could affect investor sentiment by changing their trading behavior, but it's unclear if it's positive or negative.
7. YouTube app support feature—that might indicate an Apple product enhancing its service offering.

Putting this together: Positive factors include strong smartphone market demand and potential gains from related tech products. The third tweet mentions 84% market share, which is a solid point for investor confidence. The fourth tweet about MySQL's stock could provide more insight into the company's financials or growth prospects. However, since I can't determine the exact impact on the overall price, but based on positive factors, the sentiment seems positive.

Wait, but looking at the output requirements, it needs to conclude with [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Since there are positive elements like market share and trading info, I think the overall sentiment should be Positive."
2014-11-01,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether these tweets are going to have a positive, neutral, or negative impact on the stock price of the company in question. Let's break this down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol mentioned in the tweets: mine pre 10k. Hmm, that doesn't ring a bell with any specific stock I know off the top of my head. Maybe it's just a placeholder or maybe the user meant something else? Wait, no, perhaps ""mine"" is part of the tweet content. Let me check.

Looking at the tweets, they're all about various companies mentioned like minerco resources, Tesla, Facebook, Amazon, etc. So I think each tweet is referring to one of these companies. But the target stock symbol is mine pre 10k. Maybe that's a typo? Or perhaps it's meant to represent something else. Wait, no, looking again: ""pre 10k"" might mean below $10,000 or something like that.

But the user provided the tweets as:
1. $ mine pre 10k - what to expect from minerco resources ' 10k URL $ twtr $ fb $ aapl $ mnst $ ko $ pep $ goog $ aria $ cytr $ loco $ p

So each tweet is a quote or some kind of information about these companies. For example, ""what to expect from minerco resources"" could be talking about news about minerco's future performance.

Now, I need to analyze each tweet individually and determine if it has a positive, neutral, or negative impact on the stock price of that target company. Since all tweets are for different stocks, but the user is asking about ""the given company,"" which seems unclear. Maybe they're referring to one specific company in these tweets?

Wait, I'm a bit confused because the target symbol isn't clear from the tweets provided. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

The task is: Analyze the provided tweets to determine their likely impact on the future stock price of a given company. The output should be ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"". But the target stock symbol isn't in the list, and each tweet seems to discuss different companies.

Is there more context? Perhaps ""mine pre 10k"" refers to the price range being under $10k for that stock? Or maybe it's a placeholder indicating something about the company. Without knowing which company is referred to as ""mine,"" I can't accurately assess the impact of each tweet on any specific stock.

Wait, perhaps ""mine"" was meant to be a code or part of the query. Maybe the user intended to ask about a specific stock but messed up the symbol? Or maybe it's a typo. Alternatively, ""pre 10k"" might indicate that the focus is on the current price range, which could affect investor expectations.

But since all tweets are individual mentions of different stocks and each affects their own stock prices, perhaps this is about multiple stocks? But the output should be for one company, so I must have misunderstood something.

Wait, maybe ""mine pre 10k"" was a misspelling or part of the query. Let me check again:

The tweets are:
1. $ mine pre 10k - what to expect from minerco resources ' 10k URL $ twtr $ fb $ aapl $ mnst $ ko $ pep $ goog $ aria $ cytr $ loco $ p

So, each tweet is about different companies. The target stock symbol isn't present in these tweets, so perhaps the user meant something else. Maybe ""mine"" was supposed to be a company name? Alternatively, it's unclear.

Assuming that all these tweets are related to the same company, maybe it's an oversight. But given that each tweet is about different companies, I think the problem is likely referring to multiple stocks. However, since the output needs to be for one stock, perhaps the user wants a summary of all impacts on one specific stock.

Alternatively, maybe ""mine"" refers to the target company in question, and these tweets are statements from investors or analysts about its performance before 10k dollars. But without knowing which stock it is, I can't proceed.

Wait, looking again: the first tweet says ""what to expect from minerco resources ' 10k URL $ twtr $ fb $ aapl $ mnst $ ko $ pep $ goog $ aria $ cytr $ loco $ p"". It seems like it's listing various stock names and prices. Maybe each of these is a competitor or related company.

But again, the target stock symbol isn't in this list. So perhaps I'm supposed to consider that all these tweets are for different stocks, but without knowing which one they're referring to, I can't assess their impact on the given stock.

Alternatively, maybe ""mine"" was intended as ""target stock,"" and the first tweet is a quote about the target stock before $10k. But if it's ""pre 10k,"" meaning below $10k, that could be affecting investor sentiment for short-term trading.

But without knowing which stock is being referred to, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to make an assumption here. Perhaps all these tweets are about the same company, and the target symbol was a typo or misinterpretation.

Given that, maybe each tweet's sentiment can influence the overall stock price of that one company. So perhaps I should analyze each tweet as a statement about its impact on that specific stock.

But without knowing which stock is being referred to in ""mine pre 10k,"" it's impossible to give an accurate assessment. Maybe the user intended to ask about a specific stock, but mistyped the symbol. If so, they need to specify which stock they're referring to.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps each tweet is about a different company, and the target stock in the query was a typo. So for example, if it's ""minerco resources pre 10k,"" then each tweet is a statement from investors regarding that stock before its price reached $10k.

In that case, I would need to analyze each tweet as a sentiment towards that specific stock, sum up the overall sentiment, and provide a conclusion. But since the user didn't specify which company it refers to, maybe they intended for all tweets to be about one stock but miswrote ""mine.""

Given this uncertainty, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that all these tweets are related to the same stock, and ""mine"" was a typo or misunderstanding. So each tweet is a statement regarding its impact on that stock before it hit $10k.

But again, without knowing which company it refers to, I can't determine the sentiment. Alternatively, perhaps the target stock symbol was intended as one of these companies in the tweets, like ""minerco resources"" or something else.

Wait, let's look at some of the tweet contents:

1. $ mine pre 10k - what to expect from minerco resources ' 10k URL $ twtr $ fb $ aapl $ mnst $ ko $ pep $ goog $ aria $ cytr $ loco $ p

This seems like a statement listing various companies and their current prices or something related. Maybe it's about market trends before the company's price reaches $10k.

But again, without knowing which stock is being referred to here, I'm stuck.

Perhaps the problem expects me to recognize that all these tweets are separate statements for different stocks, but since the target symbol isn't present, maybe there's a misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps ""mine"" was meant to be ""target stock,"" and each tweet is about it before its price hits $10k. Then I'd need more information about which stock it refers to.

Given that ambiguity, I think I should conclude by asking for clarification on the target stock symbol so I can accurately assess all the tweets' impact."
2014-11-02,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and figure out their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me start by breaking down the information given.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""apple , google smartphone sales strong asMicrosoft takes a hit"". The target stock here is presumably Apple Inc. (AAPL), because that's the first mention of ""apple"". So I'll focus on the sentiment related to Apple.

The tweet mentions that Apple and Google are having strong smartphone sales, but Microsoft took a hit. This could mean two things: either Apple and Google are doing well despite Microsoft losing some market share, or it might suggest that Microsoft is struggling, which could negatively impact Apple's performance if they are competitors in the same industry.

I should separate these factors into positive and negative. Positive factor here would be that both Apple and Google are selling their smartphones effectively. The negative factor is the dip in Microsoft. So overall, there's a mix of positive and negative information about each company's sales. That could lead to some mixed sentiment affecting investors' views on how Apple might perform.

Wait, but which tweet should I analyze? There are multiple tweets, but only one has an explicitly mentioning target stock: ""apple"". The others mention Google, Microsoft, or others. So perhaps the overall analysis is based on these tweets as related to a specific stock, maybe something else?

Hmm, this needs clarification. If it's about Apple, then considering their performance relative to other companies like Google and Microsoft makes sense. But if I'm looking at a different company, then each tweet is separate.

But since the output requirement specifies that the conclusion should state the overall sentiment in terms of the target stock symbol, which is probably AAPL from the first tweet, I need to focus on Apple's situation based on these tweets.

So, Apple and Google are having strong smartphone sales. But Microsoft is taking a hit. That could mean both Apple/Google and Microsoft are facing issues, or perhaps just one company in this context is underperforming. It might be that the overall trend suggests uncertainty about the tech sector, which could affect multiple companies within it.

Wait, but I'm supposed to analyze each tweet individually? Or consider all tweets together as related to a target stock?

The output says ""the given company"", so perhaps the target stock is not just AAPL. Wait, in the first line of the example, the tweet mentions ""apple"" and ""google"", then ""msft"". So I think that might be the target stock being MSFT (Microsoft).

But then the tweet about Apple would be [Positive] because they're strong sales despite Microsoft's dip. The other tweets mention Google, Apple, and others like Microsoft.

Wait, maybe this is a multi-sentence tweet? Or perhaps each tweet is separate.

I think I need to consider all the tweets together as related to multiple target stocks. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about Apple since the first line mentions ""apple"", so the analysis should focus on Apple's performance based on these tweets.

So for each relevant tweet (which includes both Apple and Google), separate factors and assess sentiment.

1. First tweet: Apple and Google are selling smartphones well, but Microsoft is down.
   - Positive factor: Apple/Google sales are strong.
   - Negative factor: Microsoft's dip affects overall performance.

2. Second tweet: Target stock is [Positive] because it's related to a company, probably another one like MSFT or something else.
   - But the target stock isn't specified here; perhaps the first tweet was about Apple but then there are others.

Wait, this is confusing. The output requires a single line with only one target stock symbol, so if the tweets mention ""apple"", that's it. So maybe I should focus on Apple regardless of other mentions in different tweets.

So for each relevant tweet (including those mentioning Apple), I need to separate positive and negative factors related to the target stock, which is probably AAPL from the first tweet.

Wait no, because all tweets are separate, so I might have multiple target stocks. But the output needs one line with the overall sentiment for a specific stock symbol.

I think perhaps each tweet is about a different company, but focusing on Apple, since that's mentioned in the first tweet. So each relevant tweet (including those about other companies) affects the analysis of Apple's performance based on their sales and the dip in Microsoft.

So I need to assess all tweets related to Apple, like ""apple"" and any others, then determine the overall sentiment.

Alternatively, maybe it's just one tweet, so I have to focus only on that one.

But looking at the output requirement, the conclusion should state the overall sentiment for a specific stock symbol. So perhaps the target is specifically [Positive] because Apple is doing well despite Microsoft taking a hit.

Wait, but that would ignore other factors in the same tweet about Google and others. Maybe it's better to analyze each factor related to Apple separately.

So:

- Positive factors: Apple and Google are selling smartphones, which is good.
- Negative factors: Microsoft takes a hit (could be a negative impact on their performance).

Since these are two separate companies affecting the same industry, but focusing on Apple specifically, I should evaluate its performance based on this context.

Given that both Apple and Google have strong sales, though the dip in Microsoft could put pressure on Apple's performance. So overall sentiment might lean towards positive if the positive factors outweigh the negative, but there are mixed signals as it's a mix of two companies.

Alternatively, perhaps all this leads to uncertainty about the tech sector, which is affecting multiple companies including Apple, so that's neutral.

I think the overall sentiment would be Neutral because while Apple is doing well in their own right, the dip in Microsoft and the other competitors could create uncertainty, leading to a neutral view."
2014-11-03,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to figure out their impact on the stock price for a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First tweet: ""google ' c ' : turkey blocked this year websites of record number URL $ goog"". Hmm, that seems like a random string of letters and symbols with a reference to Google's symbol 'goog'. Maybe it's a typo or some placeholder? I don't see any direct link to the stock here. It could be testing if I spot something irrelevant.

Second tweet: ""are personal mobile robots ever dilemma frozen ? $ irbt & $ goog stymied due to insuff sensor fov for ' situation awareness ' = unsafe . not $ gosy"". This one mentions two companies, IRBT and GOOG. The words ""situation awareness"" make me think of a safety issue or problem. Maybe it's discussing the risk of relying on robots for tasks that could lead to safety hazards. The use of ""stymied"" might indicate frustration or concern about the situation.

Third tweet: ""although the market is at highs , i'm still seeing a lot of names that are broken . $ dd $ dow $ goog $ googl $ xle $ lyb $ xhb"". This looks like a list of stock ticker symbols. While it's a mix of different stocks, the phrase ""names that are broken"" could imply that some investors have concerns about their stocks' stability or value.

Putting this together, the first tweet doesn't seem relevant to the stock. The second and third tweets mention companies that are on the market (IRBT and GOOG) and issues with robots, which could affect a business. But since the first tweet is just irrelevant, maybe it's neutral overall. The other two tweets discuss potential risks or concerns about a company but don't provide clear positive or negative signals about the stock.

So my conclusion should be Neutral."
2014-11-04,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of the given company. The user provided two tweets and asked to determine if they are positive, neutral, or negative.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER apple and google agree to a disney video deal . $ aapl $ goog $ dis URL URL."" It mentions Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), and Disney (DIS). So, the company in question is likely Disney, with stock ticker DIS.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one. 

The first tweet says: ""rt AT_USER apple and google agree to a disney video deal . $ aapl $ goog $ dis URL URL."" The user seems to be confirming a deal between Apple and Google regarding Disney's content. This could mean that the stock prices of these companies might rise as they could acquire more shares in Disney, which is a positive sign for their stock price.

The second tweet: ""material design ' + AT_USER + at_user + optimize + at_user + at_user then sell to china at_user = smart strategy $ goog url."" This one looks like it's talking about optimizing materials design and selling on China. It mentions Google (GOOG) but doesn't directly reference the target stock. However, since it's a market-driven tweet about a company, it might indicate investor interest or potential growth in related companies, which could affect the overall stock price.

Putting it all together, both tweets are positive because they mention deals with competitors and potentially drive stock prices up, especially for Apple and Google. The second tweet suggests that investing in Google might be beneficial if the market sees growth there. So, considering these factors, I'll conclude that the overall sentiment is Positive."
2014-11-05,Positive,"Alright, let's break down how I approached this query. The user provided four tweets and wants me to analyze their impact on a company's stock price using positive, neutral, or negative sentiments.

First, I identified the target stock from each tweet. But since some are missing (like ""tony faddell"" in the first tweet), I noted that it's unclear, so I marked them as ""[Missing]"".

Then, I looked at each tweet individually. For each one, I checked if they mention the stock and what factors could influence its value.

Looking at tweet 1, tony faddell is a company known for electric vehicles, so maybe this supports or complements their position on the same stock. It mentions free thermostats from Nest, which isn't directly related but could be supportive by providing affordable products to competitors.

Tweet 2 talks about a Google Cloud War affecting multiple companies, pushing up several stocks. This is a significant event in tech that could lead to price swings.

Tweet 3 lists various companies struggling with issues like organ manufacturing or oil prices, which are typically good signs because they indicate areas of concern that might affect stock performance, possibly lowering valuations.

Tweet 4 continues the list from tweet 3, covering different sectors. It also includes Binance and other cryptocurrencies, which can be positive as crypto is a growing area with potential for growth.

Lastly, tweet 5 discusses a partnership between Lg and Google, focusing on patent deals for devices. This could either boost or support an existing company depending on how it relates to their operations.

Considering all these factors—supporting the target stock, tech sector developments, and broader market concerns—I thought the overall sentiment is positive because multiple sectors are mentioned which can influence investor behavior positively. However, without knowing the exact financial details of tony faddell or the specific impact of each tweet, it's challenging to be 100% certain, hence the conclusion being positive."
2014-11-06,Neutral,"Okay, let's figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of the given company. 

First, I need to identify each tweet and extract relevant information. The user mentioned that I should focus on identifying the target stock symbol from each tweet. So, looking through the tweets:

1. It mentions $ goog high open interest for option expiration 11/07 / 2014. That doesn't directly mention a stock symbol.
2. New post with several stocks: extolling virtues of qqq, aapl, msft, etc., but again, no clear stock symbol here.
3. AT_USER's tweet seems unrelated to specific stocks.
4. Another company, sony, bringing Android 5.0 software to Xperia devices. No stock mentioned.
5. RTing about TSLA (Tencent) breaking a level in several financial platforms. Again, no stock name.
6. Referring to Google Maps era and fans of paper maps refusing to fold; this seems more about market trends or tech changes, not specific stocks.
7. Closing trades: $m sold 25, $spy sold 30, etc. This is about trading volume but doesn't mention a stock symbol.
8-9 are similar to tweet 6, just restating the same info with different platforms.

Since none of these tweets directly provide a specific stock's symbol or details about a particular company, it's challenging to determine their impact on a specific stock's price. The focus seems more on market trends and company news related to other companies rather than providing direct information about a target stock. Without a clear target stock and the necessary context, I can't assess whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative regarding any specific stock.

Therefore, the best conclusion is that there's insufficient information to determine their impact on the future stock price of a given company."
2014-11-07,Neutral,"Alright, so I need to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price of the company. The user provided two tweets and an output format where they have to conclude with ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"". Let me go through this step by step.

First, I should identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ goog "" death cross "" . so before everyone freaks out , its just one input . my broader view : URL URL"". It doesn't specify the stock symbol. The second tweet is ""transaction costs for trading $ goog with brokers , min : 0.049 % max : 0.211 % difference : 3x URL spreadbetting"". Again, no stock name there.

Since both tweets are about financial terms related to stock trading—specifically mentioning Google and transaction costs—the user probably intended the stock to be ""GOOG"" (Google). So I'll go with that as my target stock symbol: GOOG.

Next step is tweet-by-tweet analysis. For each tweet, I need to identify Positive and Negative factors. Let's look at the first tweet:

1. rt AT_USER $ goog "" death cross "" . so before everyone freaks out , its just one input . my broader view : URL URL""

This seems like a query or announcement about the stock symbol. It uses some non-English words like ""death cross"" which is likely a typo for ""death cross""—maybe an emoji? Also, mentions of transaction costs and brokers. However, without specific sentiment indicators here, it's hard to tell if this affects investor sentiment.

Now, the second tweet:

2. transaction costs for trading $ goog with brokers , min : 0.049 % max : 0.211 % difference : 3x URL spreadbetting

This one seems more specific. It mentions minimum and maximum transaction costs and a spread betting context. The numbers here are percentages, so they might be positive information about potential risks or investment strategies. But without context on how this affects the stock price directly, it's still speculative.

For each tweet, I need to assess if there's a positive (P), neutral (N), or negative (D) sentiment towards GOOG. 

Looking at the first tweet: It seems like an announcement from AT_USER about the stock symbol. While not explicit, ""fearing"" and ""just one input"" might suggest that they're cautious about buying the stock, but without knowing if this leads to a rise or fall in price, it's ambiguous.

The second tweet is more technical with financial terms but doesn't directly mention GOOG's performance. It might be part of a strategy or analysis by a broker for selling or trading options, which could influence market sentiment on how investors perceive the stock's value.

Given that both tweets are about Google-related financial topics without any direct indication of positive or negative impact on GOOG's price, it's challenging to assign a definitive overall sentiment. However, considering that each tweet provides information that might set the stage for a company's performance, especially in terms of costs and risks, it leans towards a neutral stance.

I think both tweets are contributing information that investors need to consider when making decisions about GOOG. So combining them suggests a neutral view on how these factors affect the stock price."
2014-11-08,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on a company's stock price. Let me start by breaking down each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol is important, but it doesn't seem to be provided in the given information. That makes sense because usually, we don't know the specific stock unless told otherwise. So, I'll focus on the factors and sentiments instead.

Now, for the tweets:

1. ""the best dvd on the market for traders . it sets up patterns and will improve current strategies . URL $ goog $ twtr $ free""

This seems like an investment tip related to a specific product called ""best dvd"" targeted at traders. It mentions that this product will set up patterns, improving existing strategies. The terms Google (Google) and Twitter are in there too, which might mean it's about tech stock or the company operating on both platforms.

2. ""Google's $500 billion investment in quantum computing . The project is a game-changer for AI .""

This tweet talks about Google investing a large amount in quantum computing, which seems like a positive sign because more companies are looking to invest in cutting-edge tech. Quantum computing could impact various sectors including finance if it's used there.

3. ""Twitter has $500 billion investment in artificial intelligence . Many startups are focusing on AI technologies now.""

This tweet is similar to the previous one but targets Twitter, a large social media company. The $500 billion investment in AI shows significant financial commitment. Since AI is widely adopted across industries, including finance, this could be a positive signal for companies that leverage AI.

Putting it all together:

- Each tweet mentions a significant financial investment in tech and AI, specifically quantum computing.
- These investments are expected to positively impact the company's performance as they enable advancements in technology that can improve decision-making processes in various sectors, including finance.
  
So, considering these factors, I'm leaning towards the stock being positive because more investors are encouraged by the potential of these investments. The growth from such companies could lead to better strategies and improved strategies for existing traders, which is what the first tweet suggests."

2014-11-14,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the given company. The user has provided two tweets and asked me to analyze them using specific steps. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that each tweet contains the target stock symbol. Looking at the tweets, both mention ""goog"" with a $ sign in the URL. That means the stock symbol is GOOGL or GOGO. So, whatever company we're talking about must be related to Google or Alphabet Inc., as GOGO could refer to Alphabet'sGOOGLE.

Now, looking at the content of each tweet: both say ""AT_USER google's android operating system is losing market share : URL $ goog URL"". The user mentions that their Android operating system isn't gaining market share. This is a negative statement about their product or service, which suggests dissatisfaction with competitors in the Android segment.

From my knowledge, Android has been one of the most competitive mobile operating systems, especially since Google did acquired Samsung and now Apple as well. If a company's Android product loses market share, it could indicate issues like poor design, lack of innovation, or maybe even privacy concerns related to Android's security features.

Considering this negative feedback, investors would likely be bearish on the stock. Negative sentiment can lead to a drop in stock price because people are less willing to invest if they believe the company is underperforming. The tweets also mention the URL $ goog URL, which could imply that they're checking their online presence or possibly related to a specific domain.

I don't see any positive mentions of new products, improved services, or any other positive developments in the company's business operations. It seems like there are more negative trends affecting Android adoption and usage.

In summary, the tweets present dissatisfaction with competitors in the Android market, which is a significant factor in the stock price. This sentiment alone suggests that the stock will have some negative impact on its value."

2014-11-24,Negative,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to determine the impact on the stock price for Exasort based on these tweets. 

First, I need to extract the stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the tweets:

1. ""avoid mistakes like $ esrx $ amd $ aee $ goog worth a look URL""
2. ""$ qcom find more winners like $ tcb $ mchp $ goog financialnews URL""
3. ""$ emc how emc should approach the coming quarters . future strategy in question $ vmw $ goog $ googl $ amzn $ msft URL""
4. ""rt $ tsla algos broke 245 level in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx p / t 240 $ baba $ bidu $ pcln $ goog $ fb $ amzn $ gpro $ nflx $ aapl $ qqq hft""
5. ""premium alerts ranked 1 for gains 2534 % last week URL .. $ dpm $ frak $ goog""
6. ""$ silicon valley to obama : give us more green cards URL $ msft $ aapl $ goog $ hpq stocks investing""
7. ""are you looking for more winners like $ usm $ aph $ dish $ goog money URL""
8. ""considering investing in $ gps $ hal $ taho $ goog newsletter URL""
9. ""could be breaktout time on $ cms $ rhi $ viab $ goog liquidity URL""

Hmm, the only explicit stock mentioned is ""esrx"" at the beginning of tweet 1. The other tweets mention companies like qcom, ting, emc, tsla, baba, msft, aapl, etc. So I need to focus on these.

Now, let's analyze each tweet for positive and negative factors.

1. ""avoid mistakes like $ esrx $ amd $ aee $ goog worth a look URL"" – This seems to promote avoiding mistakes related to the company esrx. It's about security or avoiding pitfalls.
2. ""$ qcom find more winners like $ tcb $ mchp $ goog financialnews URL"" – Promoting qcom as a good investment, suggesting potential gains from financial news.
3. ""$ emc how emc should approach the coming quarters . future strategy in question $ vmw $ goog $ googl $ amzn $ msft URL"" – This is more about strategies for emc's future moves, which could be positive if it leads to a good strategy moving the stock up.
4. ""rt $ tsla algos broke 245 level in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx p / t 240 $ baba $ bidu $ pcln $ goog $ fb $ amzn $ gpro $ nflx $ aapl $ qqq hft"" – Here, there are several stock names like tesla, baba, bidu, etc. The text mentions specific levels and sectors, which suggests technical analysis and potential for gains.
5. ""premium alerts ranked 1 for gains 2534 % last week URL .. $ dpm $ frak $ goog"" – This seems to suggest that there's a premium alert with significant gains in the past week. If premium alerts are positive, it might indicate strong growth.
6. ""$ silicon valley to obama : give us more green cards URL $ msft $ aapl $ goog $ hpq stocks investing"" – Promoting investing in msiq stocks when Silicon Valley is talking to Obama, which could be speculative or based on geopolitical factors.
7. ""are you looking for more winners like $ usm $ aph $ dish $ goog money URL"" – Similar to tweet 2, promoting qcom as a good company to invest in.
8. ""considering investing in $ gps $ hal $ taho $ goog newsletter URL"" – Promoting gps and other companies, suggesting they are attractive stocks.
9. ""could be breaktout time on $ cms $ rhi $ viab $ goog liquidity URL"" – Indicates that the stock may hit a breaking point on liquidity, which could mean potential gains.

Now, assessing sentiment for each tweet:

1. Promotion of avoiding mistakes: This is generally positive as it can reduce risk.
2. Promoting qcom: Promotional, could be good for growth.
3. Future strategies: Positive if leading to better decisions.
4. Technical info: Could indicate future gains based on specific levels and sectors.
5. Premium alerts with significant gains: Suggests strong demand or market expectation of high returns.
6. Geopolitical context: Speculative and speculative investing, could be positive but uncertain.
7. Promoting qcom again: Similar to tweet 2.
8. News about gps and other companies: Could indicate potential growth or investment focus.
9. Liquidity concerns: Indicates that the stock might face a sell-off, which is negative.

Now, combining these factors:

- Many tweets are promoting positive aspects like avoiding mistakes, gaining from financial news, future strategies, or technical analysis.
- There's also some speculative content based on geopolitical events and company names.
- One tweet is about liquidity concerns, which could lead to a negative impact if the stock drops.

Looking at the overall sentiment, the major positive tweets (tweets 2,3,4,7) are providing information that can drive the stock up. However, there's significant uncertainty from speculative content and a potential drop based on liquidity issues. But since there are positive signals, it might not be completely negative.

But tweet 5 mentions premium alerts with gains, which could indicate strong demand for the stock. So overall, I think there's a mix of positive factors that could push the stock up but also some uncertainty."
2014-11-25,Negative,"Alright, I've got to determine the likely impact on the stock price for the given company based on these tweets. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

Starting with the first tweet at 09:50, it's a sell order placed on TSLA around $240. That's selling, which might be negative but followed by more sells later. Then there are other stocks like BABA and PCLN also sold short, so multiple signals of sell intent.

Looking at the second tweet about HCC, it mentions clicking a URL, which could imply some research or action on another stock. Not immediately clear if that's positive or negative without more context.

The third tweet again talks about selling at $13:33 on similar stocks and includes GILNx and others, so the same pattern as before. It shows multiple sell signals, which can be a sign of strong sell pressure but not definitive.

Fourth tweet is about UHS, DWA, and UPS stock. The user mentions "" bullish,"" suggesting they're looking for gains. This could be positive if the company is in an up trend.

Fifth tweet on TSLA is another sell signal at 15:50, showing multiple sellers across several stocks.

Sixth tweet from NFLX mentions bullishness and suggests viewing stock, which reinforces the idea of potential positive movement.

Seventh tweet from AT_USER discusses doctors stopping their treatment for Gilead Sciences instead of Abbviagie. While this is a medical topic, it doesn't directly relate to TSLA's financial performance or future stock price unless there's some correlation I'm missing.

Eighth tweet is about a sell order on TSLA again at 248 levels, showing multiple selling signals.

Ninth tweet from MSG on $GSPC suggests they're considering investing. This could be positive if the company is undervalued but also shows active interest in it.

Tenth tweet mentions holding or adding to $MGMT stock, which might indicate optimism about their performance.

Eleventh tweet is a stock market report for GOGO, not related to TSLA.

Twelfth tweet warns about mistakes on WLL and PM. Doesn't seem relevant unless it's pointing towards potential issues but no connection to TSLA.

Thirteenth tweet says goog gains +0.5%, which could suggest support from investors, indicating possible positive trends or stock strength.

Fourteenth tweet is a call for the latest info on HKT's Google.

Fifteenth tweet expresses regretting an investment in WLK and axs stocks. Negative sentiment here.

Sixth tweet again mentions bullishness, reinforcing negative or positive? If it's bullish but with some context of fear, could be mixed.

Seventeenth tweet from UAL and ARW suggests a focus on GOG stock. This might indicate that the user is focusing on GOG, which could imply selling pressure if they're shorting them.

Eighteenth tweet about TSLA selling at 248 levels again shows multiple sells.

Nineteenth tweet from CNET on Google is neutral about voting to split up.

Twentieth tweet mentions research on Rook Stock, suggesting interest in that company but no immediate connection to TSLA.

Twenty-first tweet is a regretting investment decision for WLK and AXS. Negative sentiment here could have ripple effects elsewhere.

Putting it all together: The user seems to be doing a lot of selling (tweets 1,3,8,9,12,17, etc.) but also has some positive tweets about bullishness or suggesting investments. There are mixed emotions in the tweets—some encouraging, others indicating panic.

The fact that multiple sell orders and bullish mentions exist suggests that there's some concern about potential price action but it's not clear if these signals indicate strong buying or selling intent overall."
2014-11-26,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out the overall sentiment of these tweets about the stock $ goog.

First, I'll go through each tweet one by one and identify if they are positive or negative.

1. The first tweet says: ""should you buy , sell or hold $ goog $ ip $ brcm $ sso overvalued URL"" It's a bit unclear, but it seems like it's advising on actions regarding the stock without expressing strong sentiment about whether to buy, sell, or hold.

2. Next: "" $ adm great stock newsletter on $ sci $ sdrl $ goog check out URL"" Again, it's a general statement with no clear positive or negative language.

3. Third tweet: ""google ' c ' : a jumbo way to shop URL $ goog"" This seems more promotional and possibly encouraging for investing in Google, so this might be positive.

4. Fourth: "" $ rax get research on $ seic $ hpt $ goog must see URL"" Similar to the third one, it's providing information but not necessarily expressing strong opinions.

5. Fifth tweet: "" $ mu micron technology ( mu ) 35.20 +0.40 ( +1.15 % ) $ gdx $ goog $ va URL"" It mentions stock prices changing by a certain percentage, which shows some positive trend in price movement but doesn't explicitly state whether it's overvalued or undervalued.

6. Sixth: ""should you hold or add to $ tibx $ cvc $ tkr $ goog investing URL"" Again, advice without sentiment language.

7. Seventh tweet: ""google play ’ s cyber week sale is loaded with cheap movies , games , music and more $ goog - URL"" This one specifically mentions the sale at Google's website offering discounts, which could indicate that the stock might be underpriced in the market as investors see good deals coming up.

8. Eighth: ""rt $ tsla algos triggered buy @ 09:55 in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx p / t 252 $ baba $ bidu $ pcln $ goog $ fb $ amzn $ gpro $ nflx $ aapl $ qqq hft"" It talks about something happening on Twitter, but without sentiment language, it's hard to tell if it's positive or negative. Maybe some indication of an event that could affect the stock.

9. Ninth tweet: ""are you considering selling $ oas $ vmw $ mdrx $ goog financialnews URL"" Advice for selling, again a general statement without strong opinions.

10. Tenth: ""looking for more info on $ data $ dltr $ goog $ nuan visit URL"" General information request, no sentiment.

11. Twelfth tweet: ""google ' c ' : appeals court must fix dangerous ' innocence of muslims ' copyright ruling URL $ goog"" This seems critical and possibly controversial. It mentions a legal issue related to the innocent穆斯林及其信仰，which could imply that Google is taking action against something, which might be seen as negative.

Now, looking at each tweet:

- The third and seventh tweets are positive with explicit suggestions.
- The first and others don't have strong language.
- The twelfth tweet seems critical but I'm not sure if it's definitely negative. The mention of legal matters could influence opinions, but without more context, it's ambiguous.

Overall, the positive tweets indicate a desire to invest, while the negative aspects include potential issues with Google's legal stance on穆斯林及其信仰 and a suggestion that the stock might be overvalued or undervalued based on price changes. But given that the twelfth tweet is explicitly critical about something else entirely, it leans towards negative.

So considering all tweets, the overall sentiment is leaning towards Negative because there are clear mentions of legal issues and potential overvaluation."
2014-11-27,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a given company. Let me start by understanding what's being asked here. The user provided a set of tweets and wants me to analyze each one, determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative in terms of affecting the stock price.

First, I should identify which tweet corresponds to which stock symbol. Looking at the tweets:

1. ""URL ash 111 : bad news for google ($ goog ) . effect on google'spps , nasda URL""
2. ""rt AT_USER a dutch archaeologist found a lost castle they had stopped looking for 20 years ago , using google earth . $ goog $ googl""
3. ""this is madness ' URL $ fb $ aapl $ twtr $ goog $ tsla""
4. ""$ goog - venezuela to charge opposition leader in alleged plot to kill president URL""
5. ""google ' c ' : eu may ask google to extend ' right to be forgotten ' beyond europe $ goog""

Wait, I think some of these tweets might not be from a single company. Let me check each one again.

1. ""URL ash 111"" seems like an address or link but it's unclear which stock it's referring to.
2. The user mentions a Dutch archaeologist and Google Earth. This could relate to financials because they sometimes mention public figures. Maybe $ goog, so the company is Google.
3. ""this is madness ' URL $ fb $ aapl $ twtr $ goog $ tsla"" includes several stock symbols like FB, APlP, TwTr, TSLA. FB and TSLA are well-known tokens, but APlP might be less common.
4. ""$ goog - venezuela ... president URL"" again points to Google.
5. ""google ' c ' : ... beyond europe $ goog."" Also points to Google.

So it looks like all these tweets are related to Google, so I can focus on the performance of Google stock. Now, let's break down each tweet and assess their impact.

1. The first tweet is about bad news for Google (goog) affecting its PPS and NASDA.
2. A Dutch archaeologist finds a lost castle using Google Earth, which could be a story that affects Google's public image or product reviews.
3. This tweet uses various stock symbols but the words ""this is madness"" are vague but might suggest frustration or unexpected developments, possibly impacting investor sentiment.
4. mentions a Venezuelan opposition leader involved in a plot to kill the president. If Google is associated with their political activities, this could be significant.
5. Talks about extending a 'right to be forgotten' beyond Europe; not directly related to finance.

Now, evaluating each tweet's impact:

1. Bad news for Google affecting PPS and NASDA: Negative, as financial performance can be affected by product issues or stock prices.
2. Loss of a historical site using Google Earth could improve investor relations or reputation, which is positive.
3. Vague but possibly unexpected developments with multiple stocks might not have a clear impact yet on Google's fundamentals but could affect the broader market through diversification.
4. Chavez-related activity impacting Google's reputation: This seems like a significant news event in finance, making it positive for investors.
5. Not directly related to Google, so no impact.

Now, combining these thoughts. The overall sentiment is influenced by tweet 1 and tweet 4. Both suggest changes that could impact the company negatively (tweet 1) and positively (tweet 4). However, tweet 3 adds some unpredictability without a clear trend yet, but it's diversifying investments which might be neutral in terms of immediate stock price impact.

So, considering all factors, the overall sentiment is mixed. While there are positive developments and minor negative ones, the main impact comes from tweet 4 on Google's reputation, which could boost sentiment positively."
2014-11-28,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price for a company and decide if it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually.

The first tweet mentions transaction costs for trading $ goog with brokers, stating min and max rates as well as a spread bet on. Hmm, transaction costs can definitely impact the profitability of buying and selling stocks, but they might not directly affect stock prices unless they skew the profit-making edge. I don't think this is a significant factor in determining stock price movements.

Moving to the second tweet, it's talking about a currency spread bet on $ goog against eur or usd. Again, currency spreads are related to trading strategies rather than typical factors like market sentiment. They could influence trading decisions but aren't something I'd expect to affect the overall stock price directly.

The third tweet is about [Negative] regarding Google (GOOGL) and Apple (AAPL). It mentions a price war with $ goog at $1600, but wait, that doesn't make sense because a price war usually implies negative emotions. But I'm not sure if the tweet is positive or negative about the stock. Maybe it's a bit ambiguous because Google is known for its strong performance.

The fourth tweet is more neutral, talking about potential tax implications of investing in $ goog and Apple. Taxes can be a personal financial decision but aren't directly indicative of stock price impact unless investors are affected by them. Not sure how significant this is either.

Putting it all together, the tweets mention transaction costs, currency spreads, and some information about Google's company, but none seem to indicate positive or negative sentiment towards the stock itself. The main issues are financial strategies affecting trading decisions rather than investor confidence. So I think the overall impact on the stock price is neutral."
2014-11-29,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets about the stock price impact for a given company. The user provided two tweets and wants me to determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative on their future stock value.

First, looking at the target stock symbols in the tweets: I see ""BGR"" and ""BKK."" Hmm, not sure which one is which, but maybe it's better to focus on each tweet individually first.

The first tweet says: ""save 10 % on digital play store purchases with gift cards from best buy $ bby $ goog - URL."" So, BGR seems like the stock code here. The tweet mentions a sale with gift cards from Best Buy and talks about the company's URLs. It sounds like they're making a sales offer, which could attract customers. That might increase sales volume, especially if gift cards are popular. So positive factors here.

The second tweet: ""rt AT_USER video : best buy ’ s holidays start with strong sales of pricey technology URL $ bby $ aapl $ goog blackfrid …"" BGR again is mentioned along with ABBV and GOOG. The user says they're watching an APTU video, which likely shows the company's performance during Black Friday. If Black Friday sales are up, that directly affects the stock because it's related to consumer electronics or tech companies like Best Buy.

So both tweets are about the same company. The first one talks about their own products, the second about their holiday sales. Both could positively influence the stock price as they relate to customer spending and holidays with increased sales."
2014-11-30,Negative,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to analyze some tweets about stock prices and determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative for a given company. They provided specific steps with an example output.

First, I need to extract the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER so when does google start a dividend or buyback stock . $ 100 a share net in cash by 2016 . totally ridiculous . $ goog"". The user mentions ""Google"" and "" dividends or buyback stock"", so I'll note that.

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. The first tweet has two points: Google starting a dividend in 2016 and a huge net cash flow of $100 per share. Both are clearly positive because they represent potential gains or expected growth.

Then, assess the sentiment. The first tweet is critical—calling it ""totally ridiculous."" That's definitely negative. It seems like someone expects something that doesn't make sense for Google, which can lead to a downward mood among investors.

After summarizing, I need to decide if overall, these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative. Since one tweet clearly has a negative sentiment, even though others might be neutral, the overall impact would still lean towards negative because of that critical statement.

Finally, I have to conclude with a single line using [Negative] as the output."
2014-12-01,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on a company's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet mentions a market snapshot for the S&P 500 dropping by the biggest week. This is a negative event because it shows concern about the overall market, which can affect investor sentiment negatively.

2. The second tweet says $sttk's stock has gone up by 128%, in two days. That's an increase, so positive for investors who were expecting that growth.

3. The third tweet talks about Google taking advantage of China's large android user base. This could be seen as a positive because it might indicate stronger technology development or potential expansion into new markets, which can benefit a tech stock like googl.

4. The fourth tweet mentions seeking the next stock like $lkq and others that look worth checking. It's more about the user trying to find similar stocks for investment, which is neutral because it doesn't directly impact stock performance but might encourage others to invest.

5. The fifth tweet highlights the Nasdaq 100 closing lower than the Dow Jones in two days. This again signals a negative market reaction, as investors are worried about overall market conditions.

Combining all these, while there's some positive note about tech and potential growth in googl, the main negative events here include market concern (first tweet), increased stock value (second), stronger tech industry (third), and broader market downforce (fifth). However, the positive tweet is minor compared to others. The overall sentiment seems mixed but leans more towards [Neutral] because the major factors are balanced by some positives and a couple of negatives."
2014-12-02,Neutral,"Okay, I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets to determine their likely impact on the stock price of a given company. The user has provided 20 tweets related to Google and some other stocks. They want me to assess each tweet for positive, negative, or neutral sentiment towards Google.

First, let's break down what each tweet is saying.

1. ""did you lose money on $ cprt $ lm $ chd $ goog equity URL"" – This seems like a sales or revenue loss related to Google, so it's probably negative.
2. ""rt AT_USER google's ad revenue is now bigger than all newspapers and all magazines . $ goog cmo URL"" – Directly mentions Google's ad revenue being significant, which is positive for investors.
3. ""are you bearish on these stocks $ hrs $ cab $ dva $ goog liquidity URL"" – This tweet is a negative opinion about the company, so it's negative.
4. ""is it breakout time on $ ori $ swks $ mtb $ goog stockmarket URL"" – No clear information here; might be neutral or even speculative.
5. ""google google : despite headwinds , model illustrates significant upside : google : despite headwinds , model illus ..."" – This is a quoted statement from a model, so it's unclear what the author means. It could have a positive or negative angle, but not enough info.
6. ""todays stocks you should watch $ zbra $ sre $ tdw $ goog click URL"" – A call to action for watching, which is neutral.
7. ""stock watchlist you should be looking at $ goog $ hd $ splk $ blox click URL"" – Another call to action, so it's neutral.
8. ""avoid mistakes like $ cnqr $ gas $ lh $ goog view now URL"" – Negative advice but unclear sentiment overall.
9. ""10 stocks that have outperformed google over the past decade ( via AT_USER URL $ goog $ gild $ aapl $ gmcr"" – Positive info about stock performance, so positive.
10. ""stock_tracker : $ goog news intel can focus google glass on URL"" – Suggests using a service to focus on Google, which could be positive for investors.
11. ""todays stocks you should be watching $ mdt $ cyh $ rtn $ goog view now URL"" – A call to action.
12. ""do you need stock research on $ ub $ pcg $ ibkr $ goog overvalued URL"" – Negative advice about overvaluation.
13. ""sick and tired of losing money on $ dci $ aa $ gpc $ goog worth a look URL"" – Negative commentary on financial losses.
14. ""buy google stock invest in $ goog on etoro URL stocks"" – Suggesting buying, which is positive.
15. ""nyse dow_jones $ aapl $ goog $ fb $ amzn $ pcln فرصه اوبشن الأسبوع القادم بلاك بيري $ bbry 11 call 12 dec op : 20 cent URL"" – Talks about the company's stock performance, which is positive.
16. ""are you looking for more winners like $ regn $ flir $ tmk $ goog check out URL"" – Negative advice.
17. ""great pennystock research $ ahl $ wmb $ vrsn $ goog i suggest URL"" – Positive suggestion.
18. ""rt AT_USER galaxys 5 , galaxynote 4 both spotted running AT_USER 5.0 lollipop $ goog , URL URL"" – Negative commentary on stock performance.
19. ""pennystock research $ ahl $ wmb $ vrsn $ goog i suggest URL"" – Another positive suggestion.
20. ""rt AT_USER galaxys 5 , galaxynote 4 both spotted running AT_USER 5.0 lollipop $ goog , URL URL""

Now, I'll go through each tweet and assess their sentiment.

1. Negative
2. Positive
3. Negative
4. Neutral
5. Unclear but possibly positive or negative based on the statement.
6. Neutral
7. Neutral
8. Negative advice, so still negative.
9. Positive about stock performance.
10. Suggests using a service to focus on Google, which is positive.
11. Call to action.
12. Negative advice.
13. Negative commentary on financial losses.
14. Positive suggestion.
15. Positive talks about stock performance.
16. Negative advice.
17. Positive suggestion.
18. Negative commentary.
19. Positive suggestion.
20. Unclear, but the repeated ""lollipop"" suggests positive.

Now, combining all these:

- Most tweets are either positive or neutral (tweets 2,9,10,14,15,17,19).
- Some are negative (tweets 1,3,8,13,16,18).
- There's some uncertainty in tweet 5 and 20.

Overall, it seems the tweets have a mix of positive and negative sentiments. The model's performance and stock research advice lean towards positive, while the user action calls are neutral. The financial commentary is mixed but leans more positive."
2014-12-03,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price of a company and determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me start by looking at each tweet.

First, I see that several tweets mention Google and talk about their performance. The first one says the pick gained 285% in 5 days and mentions getting it early tomorrow. That sounds like a strong, positive action to invest in, which usually indicates good news for the stock.

The second tweet talks about small-cap stocks breaking into the next 52 weeks high and mentions some company names. While this could be positive, I'm not sure if the exact companies are known or their financial health is something that can be relied upon without more information.

Looking at the third tweet, it's from a user who called Google a ""platform for piracy."" That sounds like a negative statement about Google's revenue streams, suggesting they generate money through piracy rather than original content. This could impact investor confidence negatively.

The fourth and fifth tweets mention Penny stocks running 171% in one day. This is a big increase, but I'm not sure how relevant it is without knowing if the stock names are specific to a company or an index. It's possible that this indicates good performance for those stocks.

Finally, the sixth tweet is about bullish sentiment on certain stocks, using words like ""bullish"" and ""visit."" While positive, it doesn't specify which stocks, so I can't be sure of their overall impact without more context.

So putting this together: some tweets are very positive about Google's performance, while others have negative comments. The overall sentiment seems to lean towards a mix, but the most prominent factor is Google's recent gains and the user's excitement about getting new picks. That suggests a potential boost for the stock price, even though other negative mentions might offset that.

I'm leaning towards a neutral or positive overall sentiment because while some actions are good, others could be misleading. The emphasis on ""get early"" might indicate eagerness to buy, but without knowing if this is an active position or just excitement, it's hard to say. However, given the most prominent and clearly stated positive elements, I think the stock might have a slight positive impact."
2014-12-04,Positive,"Okay, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided seven tweets related to $ goog, which is the stock symbol for Google.

First, I need to identify each tweet and extract the target stock symbol. It seems all tweets are about $ goog.

For each tweet, I should separate the factors: positive (P) and negative (N). Then assess the sentiment, which could be positive, neutral, or negative based on how they affect investor expectations of future performance.

Looking at the tweets:

1. The first tweet mentions a dividend declaration from Verizon Communications. Dividends are generally seen as good news because it increases cash flow and provides income to shareholders. This is likely a positive factor, so P.

2. The second tweet talks about treelighting events being significant. While tree lighting could be a promotional activity, the content itself isn't directly related to stock performance. The mention of $ gpro might not impact Google's future stock price much. So this seems neutral or maybe slightly negative if it's expected to have some positive effect elsewhere, but overall, the tweet doesn't provide direct information about Google. Maybe N.

3. The third tweet mentions a patent application titled ""procedural travel information."" Google is known for innovation in tech products and services, so this could be a good sign. This would be P.

4-5: These tweets are similar but repeat the same sentiment. They mention rt AT_USER and mention the stock indices and companies related to Google. The focus seems on investment discussions rather than specific performance data. So, no significant factors here; N.

6: Same as 4 and 5, just repeating the same content. Still, it's about general investment mentions without specific details about Google. So N again.

7: This tweet is about a penny stock picked by the user on $ sttk. It says the stock went up by 285% in five days and is still moving. This directly relates to future performance as it shows growth potential. This would be P because the price has increased, which generally means positive for investors.

Now, let's summarize:

1. P
2. N
3. P
4. N
5. N
6. N
7. P

Adding up: 1 + 3 + 7 = Positive (P), and 2,4,5,6 = Neutral (N). So overall sentiment is mostly Positive with a couple of neutral tweets.

Wait, the user's sample seems to have four positive points (tweets 1, 3, 7) and three neutral (tweets 2-6). But each tweet can be considered separately. However, sometimes multiple tweets about the same stock are combined. For example, if there are several tweets from different users or sources, it might influence the analysis. Here, all tweets seem to refer directly to Google's stock.

Given that most of them are positive (tweets 1 and 3) with a few neutral (tweets 2-6), but one tweet is very positive (tweet7). So overall, the sentiment would lean towards Positive because several tweets explicitly relate to increased growth potential or success in the tech sector."
2014-12-05,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a given company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I need to extract the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first one, it mentions $ goog goes up 1% but doesn't specify which company. Hmm, maybe I can infer based on context or the next tweets. The third tweet talks about Google's bank of america downgrade, so that might be a clue.

Now, for each tweet, I'll separate the factors into positive and negative. For example, in the first tweet, there's an increase in employee numbers, which could be positive. The URL mentions 'URL', which is likely a typo for 'url'—maybe pointing to something like Google's stock ticker or another company.

Looking at the second tweet about Oracle, it says there's a monsoon of crores arriving just ahead of winter. I'm not sure what that means, but if it relates to revenues or growth, that could be positive. The price symbol $ orcl is associated with Google, so this might influence Google stock price.

The third tweet mentions Google's bank of america downgrade, which probably affects Google's stock, especially since ""GOOGLE"" is in both the stock and the URL. This would likely have a negative impact on their price.

The fourth tweet talks about a VP discussing diversity in tech, which could affect investor sentiment by promoting diversity, thus positive.

Putting it all together: The third tweet directly mentions Google, which has a negative effect. The second tweet discusses Oracle, but without clear info on Oracle's performance, I'm not certain. The first tweet might have some positives. However, the overall impact seems mixed with both positive and negative factors."
2014-12-06,Negative,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me start by understanding what each tweet is saying.

First, the user wants me to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. But looking through the tweets, it seems like there's no clear stock symbol. The first few tweets mention things like ""alsn,"" ""armh,"" ""goog,"" and others without a specific company name. This might make it hard to determine which stock we're talking about. Maybe I should look for something that stands out or hints at a particular company.

Next, each tweet is in response to another tweet. It looks like they're analyzing the impact of those tweets on the stock price. Each one mentions either positive or negative factors and talks about sentiment. Some are about specific stocks breaking highs, others mention market trends or newsletter campaigns. 

For example, the fifth tweet says, ""couple of stocks you should watch $ has $ dlr $ tco $ goog goto URL."" It's talking about specific stocks like Has, TCO, GOOG and mentions GOOG again as a keyword. That seems a bit confusing because it's using GOOG in both the name and as part of another tweet. Maybe it's a typo or something.

Looking at other tweets, they mention stock symbols like APL, GM, FCX, etc. So perhaps each is referring to a different company? For instance, the first tweet mentions $ alsn $ srcl $ goog $ yod economy URL. It could be referring to something like Al Snell or SRCL or GOOG.

But without knowing exactly which stock symbol corresponds to each tweet, it's challenging to assess their impact directly. Maybe I can infer based on other factors. Some tweets talk about small-cap stocks breaking into a high, others mention market trends or specific newsletter campaigns for upcoming stocks.

Some tweets are positive, like ""apple : facing a challenge from google's android"" which could mean Apple is struggling due to Android issues, affecting their stock. Others might be negative, such as ""cern $ cfn $ trmb $ goog liquidity,"" suggesting concerns about CERN's liquidity.

The overall sentiment seems mixed because some tweets are clearly positive or negative for specific stocks, while others are broader market commentary without a clear tie-in to a single company. However, given the context of the first tweet mentioning GOOG and other economic URLs, it might be pointing towards a stock related to technology or a startup.

But since each tweet is addressing different stocks (like APL, GM, HPE, etc.), without knowing which one we're targeting, I can't give a definitive positive or negative analysis. It's possible that multiple tweets are contributing to the overall sentiment of their respective stocks, but without knowing which stock we're focusing on, it's hard to say.

I might have to make an educated guess based on the general market movements and economic indicators mentioned in each tweet. For example, if a lot of positive tweets mention GOOG or related issues with tech companies, maybe the overall sentiment is positive. Alternatively, negative tweets about liquidity could lead to a negative outlook.

But given that I don't have the exact target stock symbol, I can't conclude definitively. Maybe the user intended for each tweet to be focused on a specific company's performance, but without more information, it's challenging to assess."
2014-12-07,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and decide their impact on the stock price. The user provided three tweets and asked for a conclusion whether they are positive, neutral, or negative. 

First, I need to identify each tweet's target stock symbol from the first part of the processing steps. It seems like all three tweets mention "" goog "", which is the ticker symbol for Google. So, the stock in question is likely Google Inc.

Now, looking at each tweet individually:

1. The first tweet says ""barron's feature on $ goog says investors need to start paying more attention to youtube . site will do $ 9 billion in revenue in 2016 ."" Hmm, this seems to talk about a company (probably YouTube) and mentions Google's revenue for the next year. It talks about investor sentiment by suggesting they focus more on YouTube rather than Google. This could be seen as a positive note because it might influence investors' outlook on Google.

2. The second tweet is ""looking for the next $ anat $ wbc $ nsc $ goog worth a look URL"". This looks like some sort of search query to find a stock, specifically referring to Anatomical, Western, Biologics, and Nanog. It's unclear what this is looking for. If it's about finding specific companies, maybe it's targeting these biotech firms or something. The mention of Google isn't directly addressed here.

3. The third tweet says ""$ sibe , the future is mobile ... there is no doubt ... fb gets most of its profits from there , as does goog $ sibe $ goog URL."" This seems to suggest that for the future, both Facebook and Google's profits will be influenced by their performance on mobile platforms. It could imply a positive outlook on tech trends, especially mobile usage, which might affect Google.

Putting this together: The first tweet is definitely positive because it boosts investors' focus on YouTube-related companies, which is a significant sector impacting online businesses. The third tweet also suggests a favorable trend, indicating that the market might be encouraged to invest in tech companies as internet adoption grows. The second tweet is less clear and doesn't directly connect to Google's stock.

Considering all three tweets: The first strongly boosts investor sentiment, while the third gives a positive outlook on future tech trends that could impact the company. The second is too vague but might still support investment decisions if focusing on biotech sectors which are generally resilient but not immune to market changes.

I think overall, these tweets suggest a positive trend for Google's stock, especially with expectations of growth in tech and online businesses."
2014-12-08,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

First tweet is about moving from something called ulta to something else on股 Exchange. The user mentions $ ulta $ and other symbols, but it's unclear if this relates to a specific stock or ETF. It doesn't seem relevant unless it suggests a change in strategy, which might not directly impact the stock price unless related to the company.

Second tweet talks about research on cnh, ipg, gww, goog's liquidity. Liquidity could affect trading volume and prices, but without knowing what these stocks are, I can't say much.

Third tweet is about David Tepper, mentioning gm, pcln, hca, goog, hal. I don't know the context or if this relates to a specific company, so it's probably too vague.

Fourth tweet is about stocks dst, cbt, mmc, goog. Again, without knowing the specifics, I can't assess its impact on a particular stock.

Fifth tweet warns against what one might wish for regarding Russia's demise and how it could spread globally. This seems speculative and doesn't relate to any specific stock or industry unless the warning is about something like an economic downturn affecting certain companies.

Sixth tweet has a newsletter about pten, vmc, gmt, goog. Again, no context given on which company these are related to, so nothing can be determined here.

Seventh tweet talks about Yahoo and Google news, mentioning a pair trade between bank of America and Google. Pair trading strategies might indicate trends but not directly an impacting stock unless it's part of a larger trend affecting the stock price.

Eighth tweet discusses high open interest for options expiring on December 12, 2014, with goog. High open interest can affect option prices but isn't specific to a stock, so no impact on a particular company.

Ninth tweet reveals that Samsung XPixel Z4 leaks show a 5.2-inch screen and new chipset from YOLO. This information could hint at product launches or issues affecting the company's business, which might influence investor sentiment if it relates to future earnings or market share growth.

Tenth tweet talks about getting updates on hxl stock related to goog. Similar to others, this doesn't provide specific details unless it mentions a particular company, so nothing can be concluded here.

After reviewing all tweets, the only one that seems potentially relevant is the ninth one, which mentions a potential leak affecting Samsung's product. If this information leads people to expect negative news about the company or its products, it could negatively impact the stock price. However, without knowing the exact impact on specific sectors or individual stocks, I can't assign [Negative], [Neutral], or [Positive] definitively.

I might have missed something in some tweets, but based on the given information, the ninth tweet stands out as possibly influencing investor sentiment, so I'll lean towards [Negative]."
2014-12-09,Positive,"Okay, I need to determine the impact of each tweet on the stock price of Goog Inc., represented by the symbol ""GOOGL"". The possible sentiments are [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

Let me go through each tweet one by one.

1. **Don't want to lose...** - This seems like a motivational message, but it doesn't provide specific information about the stock's performance or future direction. It might be cautious but not conclusive.

2. ** goog trading near $534.47 resistance level ( URL )** - The price is a resistance point, which could mean potential upward movement, but without context, it's hard to tell if this is positive or negative for the stock.

3. ** awesome stock research on dlr bpop amat goog wallstreet url** - This mentions Goog's presence in Wall Street. Stock prices can be influenced by corporate news, so this seems like a positive factor, possibly boosting the stock.

4. **buying or selling ? pbct lh txn goog stock url** - The action of buying or selling isn't specific, making it hard to gauge sentiment. It could be neutral or even speculative.

5. **couple of stocks you should watch brcm xom neu goog singinvestor url** - This sounds like a warning about upcoming investments. If investors are watching certain stocks, it might indicate a positive outlook for the market.

6. **looking for the next ocr dte ghc goog visit url** - Again, stock-specific news related to Google's future could be positive or negative. It depends on what OCR refers to in this context.

7. **top stocks today . find out why hcbk swi ggg goog view now url** - This seems like a query for further information about Goog's performance. It doesn't provide sentiment but might prompt more analysis, which could be positive or negative.

8. **rt at user google, mscore mutual funds apple still most popular in hedge funds citigroup url goog …** - The tweet mentions mutual fund companies and Apple dominating hedge funds. This suggests interest in investment strategies but doesn't directly impact the stock price positively.

9. **trmb get more info on tso mxim goog financial url** - Similar to the previous, this is about getting information which could influence investor sentiment positively.

10. **would you like great research on stocks cnqr cci tup goog worth a look url** - The action of suggesting research indicates potential investment interest, possibly positive for the stock price.

11. **what has uber done that is less shady than goog with data or taxi iron grip on cabs?** - This seems to compare Uber's activities with Google's data and cab companies. It could be a neutral statement about Google's operations but doesn't necessarily affect stock performance.

12. **google + has all but given up on competing with fb + twtr in the developed world url** - The tweet suggests that Goog is leading in developed markets, which might indicate positive market conditions and thus a positive impact on the stock price.

13. **insider trading alerts on peg ftnt alks goog wealthmanagement url** - insider trading can cause volatility but generally benefits existing investors, making it likely to be positive for the stock price.

14. **find next hot pennystock boh atan frx goog overvalued url** - The tweet is about identifying a hot stock that might be overpriced. If the stock is overvalued, it could lead to a negative impact because investors might sell and lose money.

15. **avoid mistakes like nfg tdw cna goog view now url** - This seems like a warning against making mistakes, which can be neutral but may influence investor behavior positively by reducing errors in decision-making.

16. **fts stock market reports on stocks like aph dish goog overvalued url** - Similar to tweet 12, this could indicate that Google is doing well compared to competitors, supporting the stock price.

Now, compiling these thoughts: The tweets mostly mention Google's presence, financial news about mutual funds, and investment trends. Some are speculative or providing information but without clear positives or negatives. However, one tweet (tweet 12) points towards Goog leading in developed markets, which could be positive. Another suggests avoiding mistakes, which is neutral. Overall, the sentiment leans towards positive because of mentions of market leadership and strategic investments."
2014-12-10,Positive,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact on the company's stock price based on these tweets. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to extract the target stock from each tweet. The common ones are ""goog"" or ""g demand."" 

Looking at each tweet:

1. ""stocks to hold onto $ ub $ jkhy $ glw $ goog equity URL""
- This seems like a bullish message because it's saying the user is holding stocks related to Google.

2. ""are you bullish on these stocks $ c $ ace $ bg $ goog personalfinance URL""
- Again, it mentions Google and uses ""bullish"" which suggests positive sentiment about investments in Google.

3. ""are you looking for more winners like $ cst $ avx $ g $ goog research URL""
- This also points to Google as a target, so positive about more opportunities.

4. ""are you investing in $ ecl $ enh $ kmx $ goog must see URL""
- Again, Google is mentioned here with an ""investing"" implication, so it's reinforcing the belief that Google is a good investment.

5. ""great stock newsletter you must have $ gmcr $ jah $ cbs $ goog worth a look URL""
- This one talks about Google being a newsletter and suggesting it's worthwhile, indicating positive news.

6. ""are you looking for winners like $ ecl $ ahl $ orcl $ goog give it a try URL""
- Again, Google is mentioned here with ""winners,"" so positive sentiment.

7. ""google ' c ' : taking advantage of social media revolution URL $ goog""
- This tweet highlights the use of social media in the stock market, which can be seen as supportive because people are using technology to analyze investments.

8. ""$ goog online stock traders get their trading information here - no login required - URL""
- This message is encouraging traders about Google's stock and mentions that they don't need a login, which might suggest ease of access or a positive trend.

9. ""rt AT_USER fibonacci technical levels $ amzn , $ aapl , $ fb , $ goog ​ amzn aapl fb goog URL""
- Here, the user is recommending research on Fibonacci levels for multiple stocks, including Google. This could imply that investors are actively looking into technical analysis, which supports positive trends.

Now, combining all these factors: each tweet seems to be reinforcing or highlighting Google's importance as an investment or support from other users. They're talking about Google, suggesting it's a good candidate, and even touching on broader market movements through social media references.

The overall sentiment is looking very positive because every tweet is related to Google and the user is making them feel supported by its value. It's not negative or neutral; there's a clear indication of confidence in Google's stock."
2014-12-11,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of the given company. Let's see, the company symbol isn't provided here, but based on the tweets, it seems like we're talking about Apple Inc. or related companies like Google or Microsoft.

Looking at each tweet:

1. ""rt AT_USER nyse dow_jones $ aapl $ goog $ fb $ amzn $ pcln فرصة مضاربه اسبوعيه $ lulu 47 call 12dec op : 1.60 $"" – This seems to be a market update with the stock prices of NYSE, Dow Jones, and several others. It mentions stock prices but doesn't directly talk about positive or negative sentiment towards specific companies.

2. ""find more winners like $ goog $ cme $ lnkd $ aapl investing URL"" – Again, this is an investment guide. While it might suggest buying some stocks, I don't see clear positive or negative words here.

3. ""rt AT_USER how facebook's new search feature is a 'brilliant' way to take on google $ fb $ goog URL"" – This tweet is about Facebook's new search feature competing with Google. It sounds like it could be positive if the feature positively impacts Apple's ecosystem, but without context on whether Facebook values Apple over Google or not, it's speculative.

4. ""rt AT_USER the # of tvs connected to internet will reach 965m by 2020 , up from 339m in 2014 $ aapl $ goog $ nflx $ brcm URL"" – This is about market growth projections for Apple and Google. If this suggests good expansion potential, it could be positive.

5. ""best pennystock research $ sjm $ hca $ ce $ goog economy URL"" – Another investment guide. Not clear on the sentiment here; just offering advice without indicating buying or selling.

6. ""platinum memberships rose , after 528 % gains on penny stocks , in one month ! big update : URL $ dpm $ frak $ goog"" – This suggests penny stocks are booming, but it doesn't mention Apple's stock directly. Not a strong indicator of positive or negative sentiment for Apple.

7. ""are you looking for winners like $ mur $ vvc $ grmn $ goog overvalued URL"" – Similar to tweet 3, this is about suggesting certain companies (like Apple) as good options. It doesn't indicate whether these are overpriced or undervalued but more of a suggestion.

8. ""google ' c ' : news spain to close in mid-december ahead of new law URL"" – This is reporting on a news event related to Google's position in Spain, which could have short-term market impacts, possibly positive if the move aligns with broader market trends.

9. ""rt AT_USER google shares pricing in loss of apple search deal , says citigroup $ goog $ googl $ aapl $ yhoo $ msft $ bidu : full story URL"" – This is about Google's stock price being impacted by a deal with Apple, which could indicate either positive or negative news depending on the terms of the deal.

10. ""rt AT_USER nyse dow_jones $ aapl $ goog $ fb $ amzn $ pcln فرصة مضاربه ا礼拜يه $ lulu 47 call 12dec op : 1.60 $"" – Another market update, similar to tweet 1, with stock prices mentioned.

11. ""rt AT_USER hello from london . most read right now : google shuts news service in spain URL $ goog"" – This seems like a business move by Google shutting down their news service in Spain. If it's about reducing costs or diversifying operations, it could be positive for Apple if they're part of the same ecosystem.

12. ""$ rga buying or selling ? $ vfc $ slxp $ goog click URL"" – This tweet is speculative; it suggests stock trading actions but doesn't provide sentiment on specific stocks. It's too ambiguous without more context.

13. ""$ ba are you thinking of selling $ mtb $ pep $ goog click URL"" – Again, about potential sell thoughts on companies (like Apple), which could be positive or negative depending on the situation.

Putting it all together, each tweet has some information about market movements, but none specifically mention Apple's stock directly. Some tweets suggest investments in competitors like Facebook or Google, others talk about economic developments and stock price changes. The uncertainty around whether specific companies are undervalued or overvalued for Apple is present, as well as speculative trading suggestions that don't provide clear positive or negative cues.

Therefore, without more context on broader market trends, specific company valuations relative to Apple, or explicit buy/sell orders from other companies, it's challenging to assign a single sentiment tag. The data provided is somewhat anecdotal and not concrete evidence of Apple's performance."
2014-12-12,Negative,"Okay, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets regarding their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided a tweet about the Google News shutdown in Spain and asked me to determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative for the stock price.

First, I need to identify the target stock. The tweet mentions ""goog,"" which usually refers to the open-source programming language. That makes me think of companies like Google, Apple, or Microsoft. But since the context is about a news event related to Google News in Spain, it's likely referring to a company that has been associated with Google. I'm not sure if there's enough information given to pinpoint the exact stock symbol, so I'll proceed by considering this tweet as related to a Google-related company.

Next, I need to break down each tweet into factors and assess their impact on sentiment. But since there's only one tweet provided here, I can only analyze that one now.

Looking at the tweet: ""explaining the law behind the google news shutdown in spain : URL $ goog"" mentions the shutdown of Google News in Spain. This event is significant because it affects online services related to Google, which could negatively impact a company's stock price if it's a competitor or relies heavily on Google News for its operations.

Considering that Google has been a major player in search engines and services across multiple industries, a news event like this shutdown could reduce their revenue streams. If the tweet is from a team at Google, they might be expressing concerns about the impact of such a move, which can lower investor confidence.

I don't have enough context to know if there are other tweets or factors outside of this one. Without that information, it's challenging to assess a comprehensive overall sentiment. However, based on the given tweet alone, it seems to present a scenario where Google is concerned about a critical news event impacting their operations, which could lead to a negative outlook for their stock price.

So, considering all the points I've thought through, the impact here might be negative because of the potential consequences of Google's news shutdown."
2014-12-13,Neutral,"Alright, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a given company based on their analysis. The user provided four tweets and instructed me to assess each with [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

Looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER nyse dow_jones $ aapl $ goog $ fb $ amzn $ pcln عقد للأسبوع القادم $ lulu 55 call op : 58 cent السهم في طور تكوين رايه"". It mentions the stock symbols and talks about upcoming stock prices, suggesting it's positive. This seems like a buy signal.

Second tweet: ""rt AT_USER the value of a multi-disciplinary approach to investing : URL by AT_USER | $ aapl $ goog $ sbux $ study"". The sentiment here is unclear—uses ""value"" without context, and mentions investments but doesn't specify positive or negative. It's vague enough that it's neutral.

Third tweet: Same as the second one, which is likely ambiguous. Both are similar, so I can consider them as neutral.

Fourth tweet: ""rt AT_USER nyse dow_jones $ aapl $ goog $ fb $ amzn $ pcln عقدacies upcoming stock prices."" Similar to the first, it's about upcoming stock prices and suggesting buy, hence positive.

Putting it all together, two tweets are very positive, one is neutral, and one is ambiguous. The overall sentiment isn't entirely clear due to the uncertainty in the second and third tweets, but they still contribute some positive information."
2014-12-14,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for the company in question. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at tweet 1: ""$ expd are you hanging on $ klac $ gis $ goog financial URL"". The words ""expd"" and ""klac"" don't seem familiar to me as corporate acronyms or stock symbols. It just looks like some random symbols for the company. Then there's a mention of ""goog"" which I recognize is Google. So, it seems like Google might be involved here.

Next, tweet 2: ""tip of the iceberg : ' unseen operation behind the accuracy of google maps ' URL AT_USER $ goog maps technology engineering"". Here, ""maps"" and ""tech"" are tech-related terms, which suggests a focus on Google's products or services. The mention of ""accuracy"" might indicate that they're concerned about any issues related to their products.

Now, considering these tweets, they both seem to be pointing towards Google as the company in question. The first tweet adds some vague stock symbol references but could imply they're part of a broader investment strategy. The second tweet is more specific, mentioning maps and tech, which are services Google provides. 

I don't see any positive indicators here. The tweets are all about the company without any strong praise or positive comments about their performance, products, or future prospects. They're just pointing out that Google is a significant part of their operations.

So, combining both tweets, there's no clear signal for a positive outlook on the stock price. It seems neutral because neither tweet provides evidence of improvement or positive trends in financial performance. They also don't suggest any major changes to their operations or products."
2014-12-15,Neutral,"Alright, I'm looking at these tweets and trying to figure out their impact on the stock price for Facebook (FB). Let me go through each tweet one by one.

First tweet: It mentions hackathons helping Facebook evolve, so that's a positive sign. South Korea is also interested in doing similar things with $fb goog msft URL via AT_USER. That seems like good news because it could lead to more social media integration and growth. Positive factors here are likely increasing investor confidence.

Second tweet talks about regretting an investment in several companies: tjx, goog, sndk, etc., mentioning money management. This is a negative sign because investing decisions can impact returns. But the tweet doesn't specify how much, just that it's regretting the investment. So, it might have mixed feelings but not necessarily a clear positive or negative effect on the stock.

Third tweet introduces free research on_thrx, clf, acas, goog for personal finance. Personal finance is important for users to manage their money effectively. More research could lead to better products and services, which could benefit the company. So, this adds to the overall positive outlook.

Fourth tweet has a long-form message with specific URLs and times, asking about the stock's performance at 05:00 and 06:757. It seems like it's a question rather than an action or opinion. The time differences might indicate the market being in a particular state at those moments.

Fifth tweet suggests looking for winners like $aon$ avb$ goog wallstreet. Wall Street is known for tech stocks, and Google is well-established there. This could be positive news because it's about potential gains from established tech companies. This adds to Facebook's stock's prospects.

Sixth tweet mentions investing in the smart home boom with URLs $goog lgepf aapl msft iot tech. Smart home products are growing, so this could be good for Facebook's revenue and user engagement. Another positive factor.

Seventh tweet talks about Dutch regulators threatening Google with a fine over personal data storage if they don't comply. Personal data regulations can affect a company's reputation, especially in the EU. This seems like a serious regulatory threat which is a negative factor because it could lead to public backlash or loss of trust.

Eighth tweet mentions watching a couple of stocks: pep, taho, tmo, goog liquidity. Liquidity issues are bad for companies because investors prefer easier access to funds. This negative news might reduce the stock's value but isn't enough to outweigh other positive points.

Putting it all together, I see multiple positive factors like successful tech investments, new research, and a focus on smart home products. However, there are also several negative factors such as regulatory threats and potential liquidity issues. Some tweets seem more like questions than statements about the stock itself. 

The overall sentiment is likely neutral because while there are both good and bad signs, they might not balance each other out to create a clear positive or negative outlook. The market might be in a gray area where various factors could influence the stock's performance but don't all contribute in a consistent way."
2014-12-16,Negative,"Alright, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company, probably Goog Inc., based on their positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll look for key words like ""gains,"" ""support,"" ""supporting,"" ""expected future performance,"" ""outlook,"" and any mentions of potential investors. Each tweet seems to be about the stock's upcoming news, reports, or company developments.

1. The first tweet says Google’s project LooN gains support from the French space agency. That sounds positive because a supportive company could lead to growth.
2. The second one lists stocks like Thc, MRVL, APAM, and GOOG. While it mentions Google, the other companies might have their own implications, but overall, focusing on Google's stock seems relevant.
3. The third tweet talks about stock market reports for KMP, LPI, EMG, and GOOG. Similar to previous ones, Google's stock is at the center here.
4. The fourth tweet mentions insider trading updates by BKD, GWR, ZION, affecting AT_USER. This could raise concerns but might also indicate potential opportunities if the information is positive.
5. The fifth tweet gives details about insider trading updates. It seems to be an update on BKD's actions, which can affect investor sentiment positively or negatively depending on how the market reacts.
6. Sixth tweet lists Aes, Re, Gild, and GOOG stocks. Again, Google's stock is mentioned here.
7. Seventh tweet suggests selling HCN stocks in exchange for goog's AMG and RT liquidity. This sounds like a potential investment move that could impact the stock price positively if the market reacts favorably.
8. The eighth tweet mentions the NYSE, DOW_JONES, APL, GOOG, FB, and AMZN. It doesn't directly mention Google but is focused on other companies which might indicate broader market trends affecting the stock indirectly.
9. Similar to 6, it lists another set of stocks including GOOG.
10. Another listing of stocks like APL, GOOG, FB, AMZN, etc.
11. The eleventh tweet talks about a newsletter related to BMR, DTE, NUS, and GOOG. This might introduce new information that could influence Google's performance.

Looking at all these tweets, each seems to focus on the future of GOOG or other companies. They mention potential news about Google directly or indirectly, which usually relates to its stock price. Since none of them are negative, while some are positive, they don't show a clear bias towards positive, negative, or neutral sentiment overall.

I think each tweet contributes positively to the overall perspective on GOOG's future performance, but without specific details like earnings reports, financial news, or upcoming events, it's hard to gauge a net effect. They mainly focus on company developments and market reactions, which typically indicate positive trends in stock prices when viewed through this lens."
2014-12-17,Positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out the likely impact on the stock price for this company based on the given tweets. Let me start by understanding the task.

First, from the provided tweets, each tweet seems to be related to various topics like research on stocks, avoiding mistakes with URLs, investing in companies like Ad Be, Dell, etc., discussing Google's role in tax audits, stock holdings, etc. The goal is to analyze these tweets to determine if there's a positive, neutral, or negative impact on the stock price.

I'll follow the steps outlined: identifying the target stock symbol and then analyzing each tweet for Positive/Negative factors and sentiment. Then combine everything into an overall sentiment.

Starting with the first tweet: ""would you like great research on stocks $ hcn $ akam $ s $ goog click URL"". The phrase ""great research"" suggests they're interested in investing, so positive. But it's not a direct link to Google, more about general investment services. So partial positive.

Next: ""avoid mistakes like $ lamr $ bac $ lnt $ goog equity URL"". It mentions avoiding mistakes related to Google, which could be seen as helpful but not sure if it's negative. More about avoiding errors, so maybe neutral.

Third tweet: ""should you buy $ hog $ mck $ mrvl $ goog liquidity URL"". They're promoting buying stocks specifically with liquidity focus. That sounds positive, indicating a desire for investment in Google via liquidity. Positive factor here.

Fourth tweet: ""are you looking to buy $ adi $ holx $ adbe $ goog wallstreet URL"". Again, promoting buying stocks related to Wall Street, which could mean they're interested in tech stocks. So another positive point about interest in Wall Street as a field for investing.

Fifth tweet: ""rt AT_USER how google , ge and u . s . firms play the tax ‘ audit lottery ’ URL via AT_USER $ goog $ ge URL"". It's talking about Google's role in a specific tax scenario, which might indicate that they're interested or considering the company. This could be positive if it shows them as investors concerned with such matters.

Sixth tweet: ""find more winners like $ clgx $ aiz $ neu $ goog money URL"". Promoting finding more winning stocks related to Google, so looking for investments in tech companies. Positive because they're seeking winners. So another positive factor.

Seventh tweet: ""$ goog - the joys and hype of software called hadoop URL"". Discussing a specific software-related aspect of Google. Maybe indicating high hopes or excitement about their product, which could be seen as positive, though it's a niche topic. Partially positive.

Eighth tweet: ""should you hold or add to $ dell $ jazz $ sial $ goog must see URL"". Promoting adding investments in Dell, Jazz, Sial, and Google. Positive because Dell is a tech company that uses Google products. So another factor pointing towards positive sentiment as they might be looking at their stock.

Ninth tweet: ""$ atvi are you looking to buy $ fcx $ trmb $ goog financialnews URL"". Promoting buying stocks related to financial news. This shows interest in specific areas of finance and tech, which could indicate a focus on Wall Street or specific sectors. Positive as it's about a niche area.

Tenth tweet: ""$ wwav stock watchlist . dont be left behind $ ati $ csl $ goog money URL"". Promoting maintaining a stock watchlist, looking ahead to the future. This might imply confidence in the company's prospects for the future, so positive sentiment.

Eleventh tweet: ""$ gxp whats going on with $ mur $ sgen $ goog money URL"". Discussing what's happening with mur and sgen. Maybe indicating that Google is doing well or has certain projects, which could be a pointer towards growth. Positive as it suggests an upward trend in the company.

Twelfth tweet: ""$ cvs short sales updated tuesday , december 16 , 2014 8: 03:19 pm $ goog $ gpro $ eem $ rig URL"". Updating their short sales list, which could be seen as a strategic action. This shows they're actively managing their portfolio, which is a positive move for investors. So another positive factor.

Thirteenth tweet: ""$ goog google inc ( nasdaq : googl ) directs attention towards the retail market : google inc ( nasdaq : googl ) direct ... URL"". Promoting Google's involvement in targeting the retail market, which might indicate broader trends or customer needs. Not sure about sentiment yet; could be mixed but maybe positive.

Twelfth tweet: ""$ cvs short sales updated..."" is already analyzed, so not repeated.

Finally, twelfth tweet again mentions stock watchlist, updating, which reinforces the idea of holding stocks.

Now, compiling all these factors:

- Avoiding mistakes with Google (positive)
- Promoting stocks via liquidity and Wall Street (positive)
- Interesting in tech areas (positive)
- Tax-related focus (positive)
- Seeking wins related to tech companies (positive)
- Interest in specific software (positive)
- Focusing on financial news (positive)
- Maintaining a watchlist (positive)
- Stock movements towards tech sectors (positive)

Overall, it seems like the company is engaged in various aspects of tech and financial investments, which are positive signs. They seem to be actively invested in different areas relevant to their business, which could indicate a positive overall sentiment."
2014-12-18,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a given company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, identifying the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER investing in the smart home boom : URL $ goog $ lgepf $ aapl $ msft iot tech URL"". It mentions Google (GOOGL) as part of the investing, so that's my target.

Next, I'll analyze each tweet one by one.

1. ""rt AT_USER investing in the smart home boom : URL $ goog $ lgepf $ aapl $ msft iot tech URL"" – This clearly mentions Google and several other companies, suggesting a general interest in tech and financial investments. However, it's more about trends and not specific stock performance.

2. ""$ goog high open interest range is 565.00 to 580.00 for option expiration 12/20 / 2014 . URL"" – This tweet discusses Google's open interest for options expiring on December 20, 2014. It doesn't provide a direct price or market sentiment but mentions the number of open interest which could influence trading volume.

3. ""focus list for today $ dnkn $ rad $ pwe $ glng $ bhi $ tasr $ swks $ lnkd $ opk $ swir $ goog $ wfm $ yhoo $ baba $ gpro $ orcl $ dgly URL"" – This tweet lists multiple stocks and focuses on Google, so it's indicating interest in specific sector-specific stocks. It doesn't mention a price change but suggests investment focus.

4. ""buy google stock invest in $ goog on etoro URL stocks"" – This explicitly says to buy Google stock on Etoro. This action is a direct recommendation towards the stock, which could indicate positive sentiment if others are following the advice.

5. ""$ aapl $ goog $ cop $ xom $ jpm $ c $ bac $ gs which trading tools do you use to trade stocks & options ? proprietary & / or trade service included ?"" – This tweet is more of an informative question about trading tools, not directly about Google's stock price.

6. ""rt AT_USER $ goog is now worth more than the entire russian stock market - via AT_USER watchlist bullish URL"" – Here, it mentions that Google's value has surpassed the Russian stock market and suggests a bullish outlook. This can influence investor sentiment positively towards Google's stock.

Now, I'll assess each tweet's impact:

1. No direct price information but mentions tech sector, which might be mixed.

2. Discusses open interest for options, affecting trading but not price.

3. Focus on specific stocks, which could drive prices but doesn't mention price changes.

4. A clear buy request from Etoro, which is a strong positive action as it can push price up if others follow.

5. Info about trading tools, not directly related to stock price.

6. States Google's value surpasses the Russian market, suggesting bullish sentiment and potential for higher prices.

Considering these tweets, the most direct actions are tweet 4 (buying) and tweet 6 (positive outlook). These indicate interest in Google which can positively affect its price. Additionally, tweet 6 sets a trend of positive market perception towards Google."
2014-12-19,Neutral,"Okay, I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on a given company's stock price. Let me start by analyzing each tweet.

The first tweet is about stock market reports needing an $expe$ equity URL. That seems like information about the company, so it might be neutral because it's just another piece of information and not a positive or negative statement.

The second tweet asks if someone is looking for winners like $shw$, $lry$, $hca$, and $goog$. I think these are likely stock ticker symbols. If people are asking about winning stocks, that could indicate optimism, so maybe it's positive.

The third tweet is similar to the second one but with different symbols: $pg$, $awh$, $lb$, and $ goog $. Again, looking at those as stock names might mean they're just asking for information about winners. So this could also be positive towards the company.

Putting them together, each tweet seems to provide info on winners or market reports without any negative cues. Therefore, overall, it looks like a neutral outlook."
2014-12-20,Missing,File not found
2014-12-21,Positive,"Alright, so I need to determine the likely impact on the future stock price of a company based on these tweets. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol. The first tweet mentions ""goog goog / google inc ( us ) . score + 2."" It doesn't specify which stock, so maybe it's Google? I'll assume that for now. 

Next, I need to analyze each tweet for positive and negative factors. Let me look at tweet one: ""$ goog goog / google inc ( us ) . score + 2 . correlation ( positive ) , signal ( positive ). stocks stockaction URL."" The part after ""score +"" seems positive about the company's performance with a +2. So that's a positive factor.

For tweet two, it says: ""rt AT_USER $ aapl $ googl $ goog $ fb $ yhoo options اوبشن تداول مستشارك_المالي_bخصوص اليوم الأول من الدوره نشكر جميع من حضر ونعتذر لإق …"" This looks like it's from user AT_USER. The words here mention Apple (AAPL), Google, Facebook, and YHOO options. The part about ""options اوبشن تداول..."" might indicate uncertainty or something related to financial options, which can sometimes be negative because options trading involves risk. But the main mention is about Apple, Google, and Facebook being undervalued. So for this tweet, I think it's neutral because while there are some mentions of undervalued stocks, the overall context isn't very positive.

Now, tweet three: ""rt AT_USER google is undervalued and unloved and positioned for success in the future : part 1 URL $ goog google $ …"" This one seems more positive. The user is stating that Google is undervalued, which can attract investors because it's seen as a good investment. It mentions being unloved, which might indicate lower costs or favorable terms. So this tweet is definitely positive.

Putting it all together: 
- Tweet 1 has a strong positive score.
- Tweet 2 is neutral with some uncertainty but not much.
- Tweet 3 is very positive about Google.

Since the company referred to in the tweets (Google) seems to be doing well, and there are multiple positive tweets pointing towards its future performance, it's leaning towards a positive overall sentiment. I'll go with [Positive]."
2014-12-22,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the target stock is APPL because all the tweets are related to stock trading or financial terms like options, Facebook (FB), Google (GOOG), YHOO, and others. The user provided four tweets that I need to examine individually.

1. **First Tweet:** ""rt AT_USER $ aapl $ googl $ goog $ fb $ yhoo options اوبشن تداول الداو_جوز تذكير الخميس اجازه والجمعه نصف دوامelsing ماركسي مستشا لاحبley ت table_dau_boo_jainna_slip_march""  
   I'm not sure what this is saying. It mentions several stocks, but the wording seems a bit off and includes ""الد AU"" which might be Arabic for ""the user."" The term ""تذكير Friday morning"" suggests warnings or updates. The fact that it's in March sounds a bit out of context, like maybe a company event on a different month. This could mean there are some issues or events happening, but I'm not sure how this affects the stock price yet.

2. **Second Tweet:** ""here's why ad-giants will be watching $ orcl acquisition of datalogix $ fb $ goog $ googl $ twtr url""  
   The word ""ad-giants"" seems like a typo for ""AD Giant,"" which is a company. This tweet suggests that AD Giant is acquiring another company, LOGIX. I know AD Giant is part of the Facebook group and it's known for being a large tech company. If AD Giant is acquiring LOGIX, this could be positive news because acquisition usually indicates growth potential. It might boost APPL's stock price positively.

3. **Third Tweet:** ""rt AT_USER $ aapl $ googl $ goog $ fb $ yhoo options اوبشن石油博物馆Attaining yesterday's closing price again on thursday evening""  
   The user is talking about the stock market, mentioning energy and oil related terms like ""石油博物馆."" This could be referring to a company that deals with oil or gas. If there are updates on an upcoming market event regarding energy prices, this might indicate concern. If it's expected that prices will drop again after some news, it could have a negative impact.

4. **Fourth Tweet:** ""AT_USER $ bbry $ goog blackberry and google are working closely together to set new ... mobile security URL""  
   This one seems off-topic. It mentions BBERRY, which is a brand known as BlackBerry, not Google. They might be trying to promote their services together or collaborate on something else. Since it's about mobile security, I'm not sure how this would affect the stock price of APPL directly.

Now, putting it all together: The second tweet suggests an acquisition that could boost the stock. However, the first and third tweets are a bit unclear but could indicate events that might impact the company negatively or positively. The fourth tweet seems unrelated.

Considering all these factors, I'm leaning towards a positive overall sentiment because AD Giant's acquisition could be good news for APPL, especially if it aligns with their growth trajectory. However, without more context on the specifics of each event, it's a bit hard to say for certain."
2014-12-23,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided several tweets and asked me to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. They've given specific instructions on how to analyze it.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at each tweet, the companies mentioned are Google (GOOG), Oracle (ORCL), Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), Facebook (FB), and Amazon (AMAZON). So, without knowing which one is being analyzed, it's a bit tricky, but I'll assume each tweet refers to a different stock unless there's repetition.

Next, for each tweet, I should separate them into positive and negative factors. Positive tweets might mention successful investments, new features, or good news. Negative tweets could be about upcoming issues, closures, or rumors about the company.

Then, I need to assess the sentiment of each tweet. This means figuring out if the tone is optimistic, pessimistic, or neutral. Sentiment analysis involves looking for words like ""good,"" ""bad,"" ""positive,"" and ""negative."" Also, hashtags can indicate sentiment towards the stock.

After analyzing each tweet, I'll combine the sentiments to get an overall picture. If most tweets are positive, it might be a good indicator of a favorable outlook. Conversely, if there's a mix or mostly negative, that could suggest uncertainty.

Looking at the example response provided, they mentioned three specific stocks and analyzed their impact on a particular stock, say GOOG. The conclusion was [Positive] because all factors were positive for GOOG. But since I don't know which tweet is relevant to which stock, I might need to infer or assume based on context.

I should also consider whether each tweet refers to the same company across multiple tweets. If a company is mentioned in several tweets, it's likely part of their profile or performance over time. This could indicate consistent trends.

In cases where a tweet relates to multiple companies (e.g., an update from Oracle affecting both Oracle and Google), I might have to see if each company is being analyzed separately or if they're linked together in a way that affects the overall stock price.

Another thing to consider is whether there are any conflicting information in the tweets. If some tweets contradict each other, it could throw off the analysis. For example, one tweet announcing Google's success while another mentions an upcoming issue might balance out positively.

I also need to be cautious about hashtags and how they're used. They can indicate positive (e.g., #Google) or negative (e.g., #NegativeWord) sentiment. I should parse hashtags correctly to avoid misinterpreting the tweets' intentions.

Considering all this, I'll proceed by extracting each tweet's factors and sentiments, then aggregate them for a final sentiment score. If the majority of tweets are positive, it leans towards a positive outlook. If there's significant variance in sentiment, especially among multiple relevant tweets, it might be more nuanced.

Since the user provided 8 tweets, but without knowing which stock is being addressed, I'll have to make an assumption. Let's say they're looking at Google for example. Looking through the tweets:

1. Oracle agreeing to buy holdings -- URL
2. RFMD filings updated -- URL
3.goog boom again -- URL
4. Tackling ticker when you could access a group of tickers -- URL
5-stock chart -- URL
6-RT AT_USER $ aapl $ googl $ goog $ fb $ yhoo options -- URL (but this seems to be APOLOGIES for APL, not GOOG)
7- same as 6 but different URL
8- rt AT_USER $ aapl $ googl $ goog $ fb $ yhoo Oilers -- URL

It looks like tweet 2 and 6/7 are about Google. The rest might refer to other companies like Oracle or others. So, focusing on tweets related to GOOG:

Tweet 1: Oracle agreeing to buy holdings.
Tweet3:goog boom again.

Looking at these, both seem positive. Positive factors suggest a good outlook for GOOG. Even though tweet4 mentions Tesla (TSLA), it's a separate company and not directly relevant unless there's context linking the two.

So, aggregating these two tweets, they mention Google expanding its operations or facing challenges that could lead to growth. Without specific details on issues or news about GOOG, but based on the factors given, it seems like positive trends are emerging, which would lean towards a positive sentiment overall."
2014-12-24,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user has provided several tweets about different companies: GM, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. I need to go through each tweet one by one and assess how they might affect the stock.

First, let me list out the tweets:

1. ""Our penny stock pick on $rgmi closed up 183.78 % yesterday! massive update : URL $ gps $ nspr $ goog""
2. ""$goog sets sail for the auto market: URL $ goog , $ intc , $ invn , $ qcom , $ googl skybox skynet""
3. ""this is big news for $goog and I have not been a fan of the stk lately : URL $ ibm $ goog $ aapl""
4. ""with penny stock picks on $sttk & $rgmi, subscribers saw 671 % gains in one month ! big update: URL $ibm $ goog $aapl""
5. ""rt AT_USER ireland weighs in on microsoft data fight with u.s.: URL tech privacy law eu $msft $goog $fb""
6. ""rt AT_USER if youtube gets the interview it will single-handily make google $goog a player in the home ent space. $nflx $aapl""

I need to extract the stock symbols from these tweets and then analyze each tweet for factors affecting investor sentiment towards those stocks.

Starting with tweet 1: It mentions $rgmi, which is Google's stock. The tweet says their penny stock closed up a lot, implying potential gains. The URL includes ""goog,"" so it's definitely related to Google. I should note that this is positive because Google seems involved in a significant event.

Tweet 2 talks about Google setting sail for the auto market. This sounds like a news that could positively impact the company's performance, especially if it aligns with their growth strategy. So, positive sentiment.

Tweet 3 mentions both Google and Microsoft. It says I haven't been a fan of the stk lately. That might be negative because it suggests disappointment from stakeholders. If the user doesn't like the stock, investors could feel less bullish or even bearish.

Tweet 4 talks about subscribers seeing gains in their stock picks on Monday. With two stocks involved, this is positive for both companies. More shares are being sold, which can increase demand and potentially drive prices up. So positive sentiment here too.

Tweet 5 discusses microsoft's data fight with the U.S. focusing on privacy laws. This seems like a serious issue that could impact Microsoft's stock, making it negative. Investors might fear regulatory changes affecting their operations.

Tweet 6 mentions YouTube getting the interview which is relevant to Google as well. It suggests Google will be part of an expansion strategy for YouTube. This positive news could boost Google's valuation, so positive sentiment here.

Now, compiling all these factors:

- Positive tweets: T1 (Google up), T4 (more shares sold), T5 (Google involved in a fight), T6 (YouTube involved).
- Negative tweets: T2 (auto market growth), T3 (dis disappointment from stakeholders).

Out of the six tweets, three are positive and three negative. The overall sentiment is mixed but leans towards positive since more positive factors are present than negatives.

Therefore, I'll conclude with [Positive]."

2014-12-26,Neutral,"Okay, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about Google's stock price impact. I need to determine if each tweet is positive, neutral, or negative in relation to the stock.

Starting with the first tweet: ""$ goog lawsuit accuses google's URL of using shill bidders - ny post premarket"". Hmm, this sounds like a legal case where Google is sued for misusing their platform. Legal matters can sometimes be volatile and can affect investor sentiment. But I'm not sure if it's a positive or negative thing on the stock price yet.

Moving to tweet 2: ""rtAT_USER the median age of employees at facebook is 28 , vs . 30 at google and 31 at apple . URL $ fb $ goog $ aapl"". This seems like a direct comparison between the median employee ages of Facebook, Google, and Apple. It might influence investor expectations about company performance, especially in areas like innovation or product launches. But I'm not sure how relevant this is to stock price.

Tweet 3: ""$ googl $ goog $ fb $ yhoo精油 tables refer to options on google and facebook. The tweet mentions $ profil_ Sheldon King , which translates to ""Thanks for sharing"". It seems to be setting up some kind of promotional content or feature. While promotional content can boost sales, it might also affect stock price positively if the company is expanding or acquiring other businesses.

Finally, tweet 4: ""rt AT_USER the same as tweet 2. Median age comparison again."" Similar to tweet 2, this seems like a business-related comparison affecting investor sentiment. It's possible that these statistics could influence how investors view the company and its future performance.

Putting it all together, none of these tweets seem particularly positive or negative in their direct impact on stock price. They mainly pertain to internal company details or legal matters which might not have a significant enough effect to sway the stock. So I think each tweet is probably neutral."
2014-12-27,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative in terms of their impact on a company's stock price. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

First tweet: ""barron's : our 10 favorite stocks for 2015 URL $ gm $ bac $ ba $ aal $ mu $ goog $ m $ rcl $ flr $ gild via AT_USER"". Hmm, this seems like a website link. It mentions GM, BA, etc., which are financial companies. The mention of ""for 2015"" might indicate they're looking ahead or perhaps they want to discuss the stock performance for that year. But since it's an external link and not directly related to the company's news or earnings, I'm not sure if this affects the stock price.

Second tweet: ""$ ewp keeping this on watch $ corn $ gold $ gfi $ dis $ goog URL"". Again, it looks like a financial-related tweet. The words ""ewp"" might be a typo for ""eastway power"", but the rest seem unrelated to news about the company's performance or financial statements. It just mentions prices and other unrelated topics.

Third tweet: ""$ goog up to date company activities and other important information about $ goog URL"". This looks like another link, possibly to Google's website. Similar to the first tweet, it's providing information that might be about Google's stock but doesn't directly relate to a specific company being discussed. It could indicate updates on the company's performance or financials, which could affect their stock price.

Putting this all together, none of these tweets provide direct information about a specific company whose stock is in question. They're more like announcements from third-party websites related to major companies like Google and GM. Since they don't specifically mention anything about the target company, I can't determine the impact on its stock price. Therefore, it's likely [Neutral] because there's no relevant information provided."
2014-12-28,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out how the given tweets affect the stock price of a company. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the user provided two tweets and told me the target stock symbol is $VTSI since that's in one of the tweets. But wait, no, looking again, the first tweet mentions VTSI but only gives some context about a gld review. Hmm, maybe I should focus on each tweet separately.

The user wants me to analyze each tweet and then determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative towards the stock. Then combine them to get an overall sentiment.

Starting with the first tweet: ""$ gld reviews updated sunday , december 28 , 2014 02:59 : 23 am $ vtsi $ xle $ smn $ goog URL"". So, this is about a GLOD review. The words ""GLOD"" might refer to a stock or an index, but since I don't have the exact symbol, it's unclear. It's likely related to technology stocks or financial reviews. The context mentions the stock symbol VTSI and other companies like XLE, SMN, GOOG (which is Google). Since GLOD could be Google stock, a review update on December 28th might affect investor sentiment towards Google. If the review is positive, it could boost Google's stock price; if negative, it might pull it down.

The second tweet: ""$ binary options competition win $ 100,000 URL $ lnkd $ aapl $ googl $ google options URL"". This seems to mention ""binary options"" and a ""competition win."" The numbers could indicate some financial gain or prize. It also includes the stock symbols APLE (which is Apple Inc.), GOOG (Google), GFB (which might be Facebook's stock, but again, without knowing the exact symbol, it's unclear), AGL options, and Google. If someone won a binary options competition with $100k, that could lead to increased interest in technology stocks or specific sectors, which might influence their prices. But I'm not sure how strong this effect is.

Now, considering each tweet individually:

1. The GLOD review tweet: Without the exact stock symbol, it's hard to be certain. If ""gld"" refers to a specific stock, maybe from Goldman Sachs or another company related to tech, but since only GLOD isn't familiar, I'll consider if reviews can influence a stock. Generally, media updates about companies can affect their valuations. A positive review might increase interest and thus the price.

2. The binary options tweet: This is more speculative. Winning a competition could lead to increased demand for tech stocks or specific financial instruments. However, without knowing the exact outcome or prize, it's challenging to assess the sentiment's impact on stock prices.

Combining both tweets, one positive (GLOD review) and one speculative (binary options competition), but I'm not sure if they can combine positively. It's possible that a few positive factors could push the price up, but given the speculative nature of the second tweet, it might be neutral or slightly negative.

But wait, maybe the tweets mention Google since both include ""URL"" and ""googl."" So, both tweets have elements related to Google. Let me check: The first tweet has ""googl"" in ""gld reviews updated sunday , december 28 , 2014 02:59 : 23 am $ vtsi $ xle $ smn $ goog URL."" So, ""gld"" might refer to Goldman Sachs or another stock. The second tweet has ""googl,"" which is Google, and also mentions ""options.""

If the GLOD review affects Goldman Sachs (which could be a separate company), and the binary options competition with Google, then both could have significant impacts. But I don't know how their combined effects would affect VTSI's stock price.

Alternatively, maybe it's just two separate tweets, each affecting different factors or unrelated companies. So, without specific context on what VTSI represents, it's hard to tell the overall impact. However, considering that both tweets mention Google and possibly a review of another company, there might be some positive effect from the competition and the news about Google.

But since one tweet is speculative with a binary options competition, I'm more cautious about assuming they'll affect VTSI. It's possible that the competitive outcome might not have a huge impact on stock prices unless it leads to increased demand or speculation among investors.

Given that the first tweet could potentially boost VTSI if ""gld"" relates to another tech company, and the second one affects Google, which could be part of VTSI's portfolio. So, there could be some positive influence from both tweets.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's safer to assume a slight positive impact because the tweets are related to significant companies like Google and have elements that might positively affect their stock prices."
2014-12-29,Positive,"Okay, let's try to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the given company. The company symbol isn't clear from the tweets, but I'll focus on the information provided.

First, looking at each tweet individually:

1. ""the binary options competition win $ 100,000 URL $ lnkd $ aapl $ googl $ goog $ fb $ yhoo options URL"" – This seems like it's about something related to a business win or success, which might be positive.

2. ""gmail blocked in china . wonder what's next ... URL $ goog"" – Blocked in China could cause some issues, but not sure how that affects the stock.

3. ""rt AT_USER gmail is now blocked in china : URL $ goog URL"" – Another mention of being blocked, similar to tweet 2.

4. ""rt AT_USER . AT_USER to expand google fiber services to india $ goog URL URL"" – Expanding services might have positive impacts on the company's performance.

5. ""success starts with a 100 % bonus ! URL $ lnkd $ aapl $ googl $ goog $ fb $ yhoo freebets $ gold URL"" – The promise of high returns is a common positive signal for investors.

6. ""$ nadl pe = 2 wow reminds me of $ bac at 2 $ a share $ xom $ cop $ bp $ wmt $ c $ x $ jpm $ spy $ dia $ qqq $ tlt $ gld $ slv $ brka $ brkb $ fb $ goog $ twtr $ jnj"" – This is a bunch of financial metrics and maybe some stock names, but it doesn't seem like specific news about the target company. It could be providing information or context.

7. ""rt AT_USER gmail is now blocked in china : URL $ goog URL"" – Another mention of being blocked.

Putting this together, tweet 1 talks about a success with money, which is positive. Tweets 4 and 5 suggest potential gains from expansion and high returns. However, tweet 6 provides some financial data that might not directly relate to the company's stock. 

The overall sentiment seems positive because there are mentions of success opportunities and potential gains, even though other tweets don't specify their relation to the target company."
2014-12-30,Positive,"Alright, I need to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price of the company. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually.

The first tweet mentions that Microsoft spent $11 billion on R&D last year, more than Amazon or Google. This is a positive statement because it shows growth potential and investment in future projects. So, this tweet is likely to be positive.

Moving on to the second tweet, it talks about winning a binary options competition for $100k. Binary options are a financial instrument that can be risky, but winning them isn't always favorable. However, it's not explicitly stated whether they paid out or if there were any negative consequences mentioned. Given that it's an investment tip, it might not directly affect the stock price negatively. It could be considered a neutral factor.

The third tweet mentions Google investing in China and has ties with them, but again, binary options are risky. The impact isn't clear without knowing more about the outcomes or benefits of these investments. So this could have a neutral effect.

In total, two positive factors (first tweet) and one potentially neutral or uncertain factor. This seems like it's overall positive enough to lean towards a [Positive] sentiment."
2014-12-31,Neutral,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for a given company. The user has provided three tweets, each mentioning different stocks and keywords like ""binary options competition win"" or specific symbols.

First, I'll start by extracting the target stock from each tweet. For each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. Then, assess the sentiment of each tweet towards the stock price. Finally, combine these sentiments into an overall conclusion.

Looking at the first tweet: ""the binary options competition win $ 100,000 URL $ lnkd $ aapl $ googl $ goog $ fb $ yhoo options URL"". The term ""binary options competition win"" is both positive and negative. It mentions a specific amount earned, which could be seen as a positive outcome, but the mention of competing with others like Facebook or YHOO might indicate uncertainty, making it neutral.

The second tweet: ""our penny stock picks gained over 968 % in the past 5 weeks ! get our next pick early : URL $ erbb $ bbda $ goog"". This one is definitely positive. The high percentage gain and the offer to get a next pick indicates optimism about the company's future performance.

The third tweet: ""success starts with a 100 % bonus ! URL $ lnkd $ aapl $ googl $ goog $ fb $ yhoo options URL"". Again, this is a positive statement. Mentioning a high bonus could imply potential success or value creation, which would be positive for the stock price.

Putting it all together: The first tweet has mixed signals but leans towards neutral due to uncertainty about competitors. The second and third tweets are clearly positive with strong market performance and promises of future gains. Combining these, the overall sentiment seems positive despite a slight negative note from the first tweet."
2015-01-01,Missing,File not found
2015-01-02,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how these tweets will affect the stock price of the company mentioned in each tweet. Let's take it step by step.

Looking at the first tweet: ""Our penny stock picks gained over 968 % in the past 5 weeks! Get our next pick early."" Hmm, a significant increase is positive. The user is offering an early next pick and mentions that they're a penny stock. That sounds like good news because it could boost demand. So, I'd probably rate this tweet as Positive.

Second tweet: ""$ aal $ fb $ baba $ goog canadian solar will be the solar flying high in 15 - technically set up right now short term."" This seems to mention solar energy companies. Solar has always been a growing sector, especially with the rise of battery storage and renewable energy projects. If there's a lot of hype or technical setup expected, it can create buzz which might drive demand for solar stocks. But I'm not entirely sure if this is positive or neutral yet.

Third tweet: ""$ goog."" There's no specific mention here, but Google has been a dominant player in tech and space industries. A mention of Google could imply trustworthiness or growth potential, especially if they're expanding into new areas like quantum computing. That sounds promising for the stock. So I think this is Neutral because it depends on broader market conditions.

Now, combining all these thoughts: The first tweet is a big positive, but the second and third are more about sector trends that aren't as immediate or certain. Since there's no clear trend in any one area, the overall sentiment might be Neutral."
2015-01-03,Neutral,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this question. The user provided a list of 50 lines of text and asked me to conclude with a single line indicating the overall sentiment using tags like Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

First, I'll need to read through each line carefully to understand what's being said. Each line is in Russian, so I should make sure I know the context from the beginning. The content seems to be about something related to programming, maybe AI or coding trends? Looking at the lines, they talk about platforms like GitHub, LeetCode, Codewars, HackerRank, and others. So it's definitely about how these platforms are performing over time.

I notice that most of the lines are from July 2019. They mention the rise of data-driven decision-making in AI, but also highlight challenges such as competition among platforms, platform wars where some grow faster than others. There's a lot of talk about how companies are investing in innovation and whether they have enough to cover costs.

Now, I need to determine the sentiment from these points. The lines talk about both positives and negatives. On one hand, there's growth and potential for success. On the other hand, competition is fierce, which can be seen as a negative because it might lead to uncertainty or lower margins.

I should consider whether the positive aspects outweigh the negatives. While some platforms are growing rapidly, others struggle with their growth. This balance makes me think that the overall sentiment isn't just one way—it's a mix of both.

Looking at the words used like "" [+positive] on various platforms"" and ""[-negative] when other platforms grow faster than expected,"" it seems like there's a general trend where some are doing well, but others aren't. This implies uncertainty about which platform will see more growth or success in the future.

So, combining both positive and negative aspects, I can say that while there are opportunities, there's also room for uncertainty because of the competitive nature of the field. Therefore, it might be neutral overall, as it's neither overwhelmingly positive nor negative."
2015-01-04,Neutral,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on a company's stock price. The user provided 23 tweets, but looking at them, most seem to be about Google (GOOG) and some mention Facebook (FB), which might affect the company if it's related.

Starting with tweet 1: It talks about innovation spreading across the economy. That could mean positive because innovations often drive growth. But I'm not sure how directly that affects GOOG stock.

Tweet 2 and 3 mention Google controlling manhattan buildings for six football fields, which is a significant number but in Manhattan, which is a major US city with a lot of tech activity. This suggests strong brand presence and perhaps higher user engagement, possibly positive sentiment.

Tweets 4-10 are similar to 2 and 3, probably repeating the same information about Google's dominance. I don't see any conflicting or negative points here.

Tweets 11-23 mostly link back to GOOG, with a few mentioning Facebook as well. These could be supporting Google's presence in tech discussions, which might boost investor confidence. The links seem like positive endorsements.

Looking at tweet 23 again: ""URL URL""—it seems to be multiple URLs pointing to GOOG and FB, maybe as part of their content or social media. But without specific info on how they impact stock, it's hard to assess the effect.

I need to consider factors like brand loyalty, product market presence, and tech trends. If Google is gaining more visibility in major cities and facing competition, that could indicate positive sentiment. However, there are no explicit negative tweets here.

Overall, while there are mentions of GOOG being strong in tech discussions and having a significant user base, I don't see enough information about actual financial performance or market reactions to make a definitive conclusion."
2015-01-05,Positive,"Alright, so I'm trying to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company based on their provided content. Let me go through each tweet one by one and figure out what each is saying.

1. The first tweet mentions Clayton with $524.81 in Google. That sounds like a stock quote, so maybe it's just confirming the stock's value. I'm not sure if that affects the overall sentiment as much because it's more about the price than any trade action.

2. This tweet talks about free money in an account balance for the first 100,000 members and mentions several companies like YHOO, LNK, APL, GOOG, FB, YHOO, PTC, URL. It seems to be encouraging people to check their balances and maybe suggest trading. This is pretty supportive of a stock's growth because it's promoting trading ideas.

3. The third tweet advises traders to learn from pros and offers a 14-day trial for a product called HEMPE or Google. Again, this is encouraging someone to engage with the stock as well. It seems like a positive sign that people are interested in trading and considering stocks.

4. This tweet is about Yahoo's major mobile ad push competing with Google and Facebook. It's suggesting Yahoo might be entering into a market with them, which could lead to competition. However, if Yahoo is trying to expand their mobile ads, it might affect their revenue, but overall, it seems like something happening that could have an impact on their stock. I'm not sure if this is positive or negative because it depends on the company's strategy.

5. Similar to tweet 2, this one also mentions Google and several companies. It's promoting trading ideas and encouraging people to check their balances. The focus here seems consistent with the previous tweets, focusing more on support for trading rather than a specific stock.

6. This tweet is about Google controlling or occupying a significant strip in Manhattan buildings. That sounds like it might be related to their stock price if the company's management has control over their products or operations. It could indicate growth potential, which would be positive.

7. This tweet mentions oil prices but also talks about options and shares for companies like GM, CLN, PTC, and a URL that includes T3 or 34 call options. The mention of energy is interesting because sometimes energy stocks can impact tech companies through resources or supply chain issues. But it's more speculative, so I'm not sure if it directly affects the stock price.

8. This tweet talks about David Taylor’s largest holdings in Google, GM, PCLN, HCA, and Google again. It seems like focusing on specific stocks could indicate sectoral growth but doesn't necessarily provide a broad trend for the entire company. The focus is on individual companies within the tech industry.

Now, let's summarize the factors from each tweet:

- Positive factors: Clontz promoting trading, YHOO suggesting expansion, interest in Google's control over Manhattan buildings, David Taylor's holdings.
- Negative factors: Nothing obvious here, but looking at the tweets, they're all positive except for maybe YHOO's business plan with mobile ads. But since it's focused on specific companies and not a broad trend, I don't see a strong negative impact.

Putting this together, the tweets are mostly supportive of stock trading ideas, encouraging users to check their balances, and promoting various company activities. While there's a mention of energy costs in tweet 7, it's just part of the broader tech stock landscape without significant directionality. So overall, these tweets seem positive for a stock by encouraging trading and supporting growth-related companies."
2015-01-06,Neutral,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to analyze some tweets about a company and determine their impact on its stock price. They provided five tweets and asked for a conclusion using [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the tweets, it seems they all mention ""googl"" as the stock symbol, which is Google. So that's our target.

Next, for each tweet, I have to separate positive and negative factors. Positive factors are things like increased technology advancements, better infrastructure, or new technologies. Negative factors might include issues with debt, company performance problems, or regulatory changes.

Then, I need to assess the sentiment of each tweet, considering how it might influence investor sentiment. I should look for words that indicate support (like ""will"" or ""could"") and potential criticism (like ""might decline"").

Let's go through each tweet:

1. ""rt AT_USER $ googl $ goog $ fb $ yhoo-pillage تداول اوبشن options الداو_جونز $ baba 103 call 9jan op : 98cent مستشارك_المالي URL""
- Positive factors: Increased technology advancements, better infrastructure.
- Negative factors: Possible decline in stock price due to market volatility.

2. ""your cable internet is about to get way faster . $ brcm $ cmcsa $ goog $ vz URL""
- Positive factors: Faster internet access.
- Negative factors: Potential drop due to increased competition or costs.

3. ""save 75% by finding the cheapest broker to trade us tech giants URL $ msft $ twtr $ aapl $ fb $ goog spreadbetting cfd""
- Positive factors: More affordable trading services.
- Negative factors: Possible regulatory issues with new technologies.

4. ""$ vz $ goog : verizon communications eyes mobile video expansion ; looks to ... URL""
- Positive factors: Focus on expanding into mobile video technology.
- Negative factors: If the company faces competition or deals, it could impact stock price.

5. ""$ qld on radar $ uup $ hyg $ myec $ amzn $ goog URL""
- Positive factors: Expansion in tech and consumer goods.
- Negative factors: Possible interest from competitors like Amazon, especially with increasing demand for e-commerce services.

After separating the factors and assessing sentiment, I summarize the overall impact. The company seems to be expanding into new tech areas, which is positive. However, it's also competing with larger companies like Amazon and facing potential regulatory issues. These mixed signals make the overall sentiment neutral because there are both favorable and unfavorable factors."
2015-01-07,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the overall sentiment for all these Twitter tweets or messages about Google. Let me start by looking at each tweet one by one.

First, there are a lot of ""positive"" tweets where people are talking about Apple and how losing them could hurt Google. That seems positive because it's pointing out that Google is indirectly affected by competitors. Then there are some neutral tweets with hashtags like #AI, #Mega, etc., which are more general, so not too strong.

Some tweets have questions or statements that aren't explicitly saying yes or no, but the content itself suggests a positive outlook for Google, maybe because they're worried about things going wrong and considering steps to protect themselves. The negative tweets mention issues like the internet of things (IoT) and other problems, so those are pretty straightforward negatives.

There's also an active #AI hashtag mentioned in some tweets, which makes me think about how AI is changing things and maybe Google is looking into it for improvements or innovations.

Looking at all these, there seems to be a mix. Some are definitely positive, others are neutral, and some are negative. Since not everyone is completely positive, I should balance that. But given the majority of positive statements pointing out competition's impact on Google, even with some negatives, maybe the overall sentiment leans towards [Neutral] or slightly [Positive]."
2015-01-08,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me start by understanding what each tweet is saying and how it might affect investors.

First tweet: It says there's a -58.7% decline in tablet sales during holidays, mentioning $ goog URL and $ aapl. That sounds like negative news because of declining tablet sales. I'm not too familiar with all the stocks mentioned, but maybe this could hurt the company's revenue or profit if they're focusing on tablets.

Second tweet: It mentions that AT_USER will demonstrate his trading strategy for three different stocks: ABLP, FB, and GOOG. He uses a URL like ""will demonstrate how he trades these 3 different stocks : $ aapl , $ fb & $ goog"". This seems like a positive sign because it's showing an interest in these companies, which might encourage investors to buy their shares.

Third tweet: It talks about the traders' earnings and stock prices. The words include ""bind therapeutics ( bind )"", ""amicus therapeutics ( fold )"", and mentions GOOG. This could be indicating that the market is interested in Google's performance or possibly signaling some positive news about future growth.

Fourth tweet: It offers a free €5 bonus to first 100,000 members with links to several stock prices, including LNkd, APLK, GOOG, GM, and others. This is interesting because offering bonuses can sometimes encourage users to invest, which might increase the company's valuation.

Fifth tweet: It mentions that companies in early movers are $ cost, $ fdo, $ goog, etc., with an offer of more stock prices. Early movers often have a competitive advantage or high valuation, so this could suggest growth potential and positive sentiment.

Sixth tweet: Despite strong tech trends, Google lags behind with $ goog vs $ qqq. This seems like a neutral point because it's comparing two different companies. If they're both in the tech sector but Google is still behind, maybe there are other factors or weaker products that affect its performance.

Now, combining all these thoughts: The tweets mention declining tablet sales, which could hurt a company if tablets aren't their main focus. However, AT_USER trading strategies and bonuses might attract more investors. Some tweets are positive about Google's stock growth and early movers, which could influence investor sentiment positively. There's some ambiguity with the tablet sales tweet and the comparison between $ goog and $ qqq.

But considering all factors—positive incentives like bonuses and early movers, but negative news about tablet sales—it might be a mix. However, since AT_USER is promoting several tech companies including Google, which is a strong indicator of growth, maybe overall sentiment leans positive despite some warnings."
2015-01-09,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user provided a list of 52 tweets about Amazon's AMZN stock price changes and some related topics like stock prices, tech companies, etc. They asked for the overall sentiment in terms of positive, neutral, or negative.

First, I need to analyze each tweet to determine its sentiment. Each tweet talks about the stock performance, but I don't see any positive or negative language here. All tweets are neutral towards Amazon and other companies mentioned.

Now, considering the number of tweets (52), it's a decent amount to infer some general trends, but since none specify positive actions on Amazon, I can't conclude anything definitive from them. It seems all tweets just report stock prices without any opinionated statements about the company itself.

So, there's no clear pattern here because none of the individual tweets express sentiment towards Amazon or its competitors. All are factual updates without any opinions. Therefore, the overall sentiment is neutral."
2015-01-10,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets regarding their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided three tweets and wants an overall conclusion in terms of positive, neutral, or negative.

First, I'll take each tweet one by one. 

Looking at tweet 1: It mentions Google's stock is down from $500 to about 450, with some changes in the next 20, 50, and 100-day averages. The numbers are negative, indicating a downward trend. That could be seen as negative because the stock has gone lower.

 Tweet 2: It talks about logging into live stock chat for Apple, Amazon (Apolis), Facebook, and eBay. These are all tech companies that could impact the overall market. While it's not directly mentioning a specific stock price change, it seems like there might be some interest or activity in these sectors, which could influence broader market trends.

 Tweet 3: This tweet discusses how Apple, Google, and Microsoft spend on R&D. Again, this is about companies within tech that could affect the overall market performance but doesn't specify a particular stock or price change.

Considering each tweet individually, some mention stock price changes with negative percentages, which are indicative of potential negative sentiment because it's showing a decline in a key stock. However, other tweets talk about broader market participants and their strategies without directly pointing to specific stocks. These might not be as strong indicators of short-term stock impact but could still contribute to the overall market trend.

Putting this together, I'm leaning towards [Negative] because some tweets clearly show stock price declines or concerns about future performance. However, the sentiment isn't solely based on a single stock's performance but rather broader trends influenced by these other companies and their activities."
2015-01-11,Neutral,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. The user has given me 16 tweets and asked to analyze their likely effect using [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, looking at the structure of each tweet: they all seem to have similar formatting with hashtags like $ googl $ goog $ yhoo followed by some links and mentions. Each line is repetitive with the same hashtag combination repeated multiple times.

I notice that every tweet is using the same hashtags but rephrasing the message a bit. For example, ""rt AT_USER $ googl $ goog $ yhoo تداول اوبشن options الداو_جونز..."" So it's just repeating the exact content each time. That makes me think these tweets might be part of a larger campaign or trend.

Since all 16 tweets are the same, it suggests that the message is consistent and likely to be taken seriously by investors. But I'm not sure if they're promoting something specific or just general information.

Now, without more context about the company or their specific goals, it's hard to assess whether each tweet is positive, neutral, or negative towards the stock price. It could be reinforcing a strategy, providing additional info, or even potentially misleading if it doesn't align with actual news.

Given that all tweets are identical and don't vary in sentiment or content, I might default to considering them as either mostly positive or neutral since there's no evidence of negative sentiment here. But maybe leaning towards positive because they're repeating information, which could create a sense of continuity or support from the same group of investors."
2015-01-12,Neutral,"Alright, let's break down how I approached analyzing these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company.

First, I identified each tweet and extracted the target stock symbol from them. I noticed that all the tweets mention ""goog"" (Google), so I assumed the stock symbol is related to Google. 

Next, for each tweet, I separated the factors into positive and negative components. I looked at words like ""open,"" ""class,"" ""class c,"" etc., which indicate potential positives or negatives about the company.

Then, I evaluated the sentiment of each tweet. Sentiment was determined by assessing whether the tweet was listing ""big losers"" in a specific market (like Las Vegas) and mentioning competitors like Microsoft or Google's future performance.

I also considered how each tweet could influence investor sentiment. Positive tweets might boost stock prices if they highlight growth potential, while negative tweets could indicate concerns about profitability, competition, or other negative factors.

Looking at the list:
1. Tweets 2 and 6 mention Google losing in Las Vegas but don't directly talk about profits or competitors.
2. Tweet 4 discusses Apple Watch as a tech startup, which is positive.
3. Tweets 5 and 7 are speculative about Microsoft's performance there, which could be neutral.

After evaluating all these factors, I concluded that while some tweets might suggest optimism in specific contexts, the overall sentiment seems mixed with both positive and negative aspects. Therefore, I classified the stock as Neutral."
2015-01-13,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock from the first tweet: $ goog is mentioned as ""goog stocks sectors $ $"", so the target is Google (GOOGL). The other mentions are for AAPL (""attn x"") and FB (""plukje google""), but since the user hasn't specified which company to focus on, I'll assume they're talking about GOOG.

Looking at each tweet:

1. ""free stock market review ichimoku & candlestick vid jan 12 URL $ goog $ tsla stocks sectors $ $"" – This seems like a general update with some links and mentions of other stocks, but nothing specific to GOOGL or TSLA, so probably not relevant.

2. AT_USER update: ""goog now works for level 2 - just an fyi that this is spotty - note : i did nothing to see the data - cloud update?"" – This is a personal message from a user, which doesn't provide any information about GOOGL or TSLA. It's speculative and seems neutral.

3. RT AT_USER: ""remember june ' 13 when $ aapl fell 45 % from top ? that was a huge buying opportunity now being repeated over at $ goog . bu …"" – This tweet is talking about an event in June where APLX fell by 45% and mentions that this situation might again occur at GOOGL. Since the user is repeating the history, it's indicating potential for investors to buy more shares. This adds uncertainty but shows a possible buying interest.

4. RT $ qqq algos triggered buy in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 08:41 p / t 102.80 $ goog $ fb $ amzn $ baba $ tsla $ nflx $ gpro $ aapl $ tqqq hft – This tweet is from a user recalling buying stocks through various platforms (sigma-x, crossfinder, etc.). It mentions several companies but doesn't provide specific details about GOOGL. The actions here could imply investor interest in buying more shares.

5. ""get $ 25 when you sign up URL payoneer w / my link . available in over 200 countries worldwide ! bonus $ aapl $ googl $ goog"" – This is an offer for someone to join the user's link, offering a bonus amount of $25 and providing a discount code. It seems promotional without specific stock info.

6. ""plukje google gekocht ; mooi bedrijf , k / w voor 2015 is 16 met een gelijke groei per jaar , peg ratio is 1 $ goog garp URL"" – This tweet talks about the price growth of Google in 2015, specifically mentioning a 16% increase with a peg ratio of 1. It's discussing historical data on GOOG, so it might provide context or potential for investors to see growth.

7. ""$ goog : google play store has more apps than apple app store [ report ] URL"" – This tweet is making a claim about the number of apps available in Google versus Apple stores. There's no mention of GOOGL stock, just about app counts.

8. ""get $ 25 when you sign up URL payoneer w / my link . available in over 200 countries worldwide ! bonus $ aapl $ googl $ goog"" – Similar to tweet 5, it's an offer for joining the user's service with a bonus amount and discount code.

9. ""our penny stock picks gained over 968 % in 5 weeks ! get our next pick early : URL $ dpm $ frak $ goog"" – This is a promotion offering high returns on investment. It's selling stocks but doesn't provide details on the specific companies, which might not be relevant to GOOGL.

After analyzing all tweets, none of them specifically mention GOOGL or TSLA. The most relevant tweet is 6 about Google's price growth over a decade, which could give some context for investors but isn't directly related to the stocks in question. The others are either speculative personal messages or promotional offers. 

Given that the target stock is not mentioned in any of these tweets, it's difficult to determine the impact on GOOGL's stock price from this information alone. Therefore, without specific details about GOOGL, I can't conclude whether the overall sentiment is positive, neutral, or negative."
2015-01-14,Neutral,"Alright, so I have to figure out whether these tweets are positive, negative, or neutral in terms of their impact on a company's stock price. The user provided a list of six tweets and wants me to analyze them step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. But looking at the tweets, none of them mention a specific stock symbol, which might make it tricky because I can't determine the company directly. So, perhaps I should consider that the user is asking for an analysis based on these tweets without knowing the exact company.

Each tweet needs to be evaluated in two parts: identifying positive and negative factors (Factors) and assessing the overall sentiment (Sentiment). Then, combining both parts will give me a conclusion of [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative].

Starting with Tweet 1: ""$ goog $ amzn : cloud computing : is it a two horse race among URL inc ... URL""

I notice that 'AMZN' might be Amazon, but the exact identification isn't clear. The tweet mentions ""cloud computing"" and talks about a ""two horse race,"" which could imply competition or something happening in tech sectors. Cloud computing is a big area for tech stocks like AMZN, so I think there's some positive information here.

Next, Tweet 2: ""$ goog news updated wednesday , january 14 , 2015 09:07 : 29 am $ efa $ vxx $ dust $ ecig URL""

This one seems more about financial news. The company involved is VIX, which I believe is theVolatility Index, often called the ""fear index."" If the Fed lowers interest rates, it can cause stock prices to drop because investors expect uncertainty. The tweet mentions a meeting on Jan 14th and talks about EFA and DUS, which are probably indicators of economic sentiment. But VIX historically tends to rise when markets are uncertain, so maybe this is negative.

Tweet 3: ""rt AT_USER larry page still selling sold $ 16.4 m worth of $ goog on jan 12th at $ 493.03 .""

This seems like a tweet from a user calling out the company's shares being sold. The amount and price suggest that the market is reacting negatively, which would indicate negative sentiment towards this stock.

Tweet 4: ""rt AT_USER google to launch ‘ modular ’ smartphone in puerto rico $ goog URL via AT_USER""

Here, it seems like Google is planning a product launch in Puerto Rico. If the company is expanding into new markets, especially in manufacturing and technology, it could be positive news. However, launching products in PR can sometimes lead to competition from other tech companies there, so I'm not sure if that's strong or neutral.

Tweet 5: ""$ mmm recent news updated wednesday , january 14 , 2015 07:11 : 31 am $ soxl $ goog $ bac $ erx URL""

This tweet mentions M&M, which is more about the management of working capital. While that's a financial metric, I'm not sure how it directly relates to stock price impact without knowing if it affects the company's fundamentals.

Tweet 6: ""AT_USER analyzes $ goog , rates it a buy below $ 510 / share URL""

This seems like an analysis from another user. If Google is being rated as ""buy below $510,"" that might indicate concerns about its valuation, possibly a negative impact if the stock is overvalued.

Now, for each tweet, I'll separate factors and sentiment:

Tweet 1: Positive (cloud computing, two horse race), Neutral

Tweet 2: Negative (economic indicators, VIX tends to rise)

Tweet 3: Negative (market reaction, selling shares)

Tweet 4: Positive (new market expansion)

Tweet 5: Neutral (funding or cash flow, but not sure about stock impact)

Tweet 6: Negative (valuation concerns)

Now combining these:

Positive tweets: 1, 4

Neutral tweets: 2, 3, 5

Negative tweets: 6

There are more positive factors than negative, which might suggest a general positive sentiment. However, some tweets are quite specific and could have multiple effects. For instance, Google launching in Puerto Rico (Tweet 4) is both a new market and expansion, which can be positive but uncertain.

Overall, the tweet volume is mixed with varied sentiments. Some tweets directly state stock moves or analyze fundamentals, while others focus on broader market reactions. Given that some tweets are quite specific and not just general sentiment analysis, it's hard to get a clear overall picture.

But looking at factors, some tweets suggest good news (Cloud computing, expansion in Puerto Rico), bad news (VIX, valuation concerns), and neutral. The presence of positive and negative factors makes the overall sentiment uncertain. However, without knowing the exact company, I can't say for sure if it's positive or not.

Wait, but if most of the tweets are either positive or negative, with some being more mixed, perhaps it leans towards a more balanced view, making the overall sentiment neutral? Or maybe there's an edge to more positive tweets.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider that while some tweets are very specific and have strong implications, others just give general market reactions without much detail. So, if the majority of the tweets lean one way or another, but not overwhelmingly so in either direction, perhaps it's considered neutral. But since there are definitely more positive than negative tweets, maybe leaning towards positive?

Wait, no. The number is six tweets. Positive: 1 and 4. Negative: 2,3,6. Neutral: 5. So, only one tweet is neutral (Tweet 5) but the majority are either positive or negative.

But actually, I think that without specific knowledge of the company, it's impossible to know for sure. However, if we have more positive tweets than negative, maybe overall sentiment leans positive, even with some negatives.

I'm a bit torn here. It seems like mostly the user is expressing general market reactions rather than specific stock movements. So, perhaps there's not enough data to definitively say it's positive or negative. Maybe I should go with neutral because the tweets are more varied and don't tip strongly in one direction."
2015-01-15,Neutral,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether these tweets are positive, negative, or neutral in impact on the stock price of Google. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. **First Tweet**: ""google android sued re antitrust violations . samsung technews app antitrust $ goog URL"" – Hmm, this seems like a legal case. It mentions an antitrust lawsuit against Samsung. The fact that a company is suing could indicate some kind of regulatory issue or potential financial loss. However, it's not clear if this is positive, negative, or neutral because the impact on Google depends on how the court handles it.

2. **Second Tweet**: ""david tepper left his $ goog position untouched in q3 – robertson and soros downsized theirs . URL"" – This seems like a news article or report. It mentions David Tepper leaving his position without any action, and Robertson and Soros downsizing. If Google is losing money by not taking action and being downsized, that could be seen as negative because it affects their revenue. But if the downsizing isn't directly tied to Google's stock performance, maybe it's neutral.

3. **Third Tweet**: ""rt AT_USER $ goog sweep 887 jan 15 502.5 calls $ 3.46"" – This looks like some kind of news on Twitter. The user is reporting that the stock price has gone up by $887 and dropped to $3.46. That's a clear upward movement, so this seems positive.

4. **Fourth Tweet**: ""w / wishlist ready i reenterd market w / dow - 300pts today . bought 12 : $ dis $ baba $ blk $ ba $ goog $ulta $ tsla $ gs $fb $ f $ nke $ aal AT_USER"" – This is Twitter's handle for ""Wishlist."" The user has some instructions to reenter the market and buy stocks worth $300. It doesn't mention Google or its stock price directly, but it seems like Google might have something related if they're in the market buying shares. So this could be seen as positive because it could impact their stock performance.

5. **Fifth Tweet**: ""best trade : $ aapl ; $ goog $ tsla $ yhoo $ lnkd i review them at URL"" – Similar to the fourth tweet, this is about trading stocks. The user is suggesting to trade Aapl, Google, Tsla, Yyoo, etc., which could affect Google's stock price if someone buys shares from these companies.

6. **Sixth Tweet**: ""$ goog : us apple , google reach new deal with workers in us lawsuit over hiring google inc URL nasdaq"" – This mentions a legal deal between Google and Apple, resolving a lawsuit regarding the hiring of Google Inc.'s employees. It's about a labor dispute resolved, which could lead to Google benefiting from less scrutiny or something positive for their workforce. So this might be neutral because it affects other companies' labor practices but not directly Google.

7. **Seventh Tweet**: ""join me on tsū , is sharing social revenues with all of us . URL $ lnkd $ aapl $ googl $ google $ fb $ yhoo URL"" – This seems like another Twitter thread, possibly discussing a project or company. It mentions Google and Apple collaborating on something. If this collaboration leads to a positive outcome, maybe it could affect Google's performance, but not directly. So overall, maybe neutral.

8. **Eighth Tweet**: ""google ' c ' : inc witness large outflow of money URL $ goog"" – This is another tweet suggesting that Google is facing a large money loss. If this information is accurate and positive news for investors (though the term ""outflow"" might be a bit ambiguous), it could have an impact on the stock price. But I'm not sure if it's positive or negative.

9. **Ninth Tweet**: ""$ goog - u . k . 's cameron to lobby obama on encryption - - 2nd update URL"" – This mentions a political update by a U.K. Cambridge officer regarding the obama campaign on encryption. It could relate to Google if there are policies or regulations they might be involved with, which could affect their stock due to company news. But it's speculative and not directly about Google's performance.

Now, combining all these, some tweets are positive (like the first and third), others are negative (the eighth), and some are neutral. The overall sentiment seems mixed because of the various unrelated topics mentioned. But since there's a significant update from the third tweet that shows an increase in price, maybe it has a slight positive impact."
2015-01-16,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a given company. Let me start by breaking down what's required.

First, from the problem statement, I understand that each tweet needs to be analyzed for positive, negative factors and then their overall sentiment. The target is the user mentioned earlier, but since it wasn't provided here, maybe I'm supposed to infer or assume? Or perhaps it's just a placeholder?

Wait, looking back, in the process section, it says ""Your answer must be one of the following: [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]."" So there isn't an actual target stock symbol given. That seems odd because without knowing which company we're talking about, how can I determine the impact? Maybe I misread something.

Wait, perhaps the user intended for me to think about a generic situation. Or maybe it's part of a series where each tweet is related to a different stock. But since all the tweets are about Google-related terms like QQQ, FB, AMZN, etc., maybe they're all from Google.

But wait, the first tweet starts with ""rt AT_USER $ fb puts working like a champ goldmembers watching $ spy $ twtr $ tsla $ goog URL get alerted when we …"" So that seems to be about Facebook (FB), not Google. Hmm, so perhaps the target stock is FB? Or maybe the user made a typo.

Alternatively, if I have to infer, perhaps these tweets are all related to companies similar to Google or Facebook, given their topics.

But regardless of which company we're talking about, each tweet has positive and negative factors that might influence investor sentiment. The key here is to assess how each tweet affects the stock price based on those factors.

Let me go through each tweet:

1. ""rt AT_USER $ fb puts working like a champ goldmembers watching $ spy $ twtr $ tsla $ goog URL get alerted when we …""
2. Same as above, perhaps another mention of FB or similar.
3. Another one with same structure, maybe FB again.
4. Repeat of the first three tweets, so probably FB is involved here.
5. Similar to the first three but a bit shorter.
6. ""rt AT_USER yes , googleglass is dead - - but glassholes find phoenix fire itbw for AT_USER $ goog ~ ~ ~ URL ~ ~ ~""
7. ""qqq trading at 100.49 , 149 bpts above f / v , p / t 98.00 $ goog $ fb $ amzn $ tsla $ nflx $ bidu $ gpro $ aapl $ baba hft""
8. ""rt AT_USER yes , googleglass is dead - - but glassholes find phoenix fire itbw for AT_USER $ goog ~ ~ ~ URL ~ ~ ~""
9. Same as tweet 7, just with different stocks.
10. ""AT_USER AT_USER $ goog topped out as a leader long time ago . same with $ pcln $ crm etc""
11. Another one from tweet 7 and 8 but shorter.
12. Similar to tweet 5 or 6, mentioning FB or similar.
13. "" phenomenal stock trade alerts URL $ cdti + 40 % URL $ gild $ kmi $ jnj $ orcl $ goog $ bac $ cvx $ csco $ baba $ t""
14. Join me on tsū , is sharing social revenues with all of us . URL $ lnkd $ aapl $ googl $ goog $ fb $ yhoo
15. ""what google glass can learn from five other failed inventions URL $ goog""
16. ""rt $ qqq algos triggered sell in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 10:35 , p / t 98.00 $ goog $ fb $ amzn $ tsla $ nflx $ bidu $ gpro $ aapl $ baba hft""
17. ""goog driving the move to driverless cars $ f $ gm $ tm may prove to be bigger biz than search""
18. ""rt $ baba algos triggered sell in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 08:02 p / t 93.00 $ goog $ fb $ amzn $ tsla $ nflx $ bidu $ gpro $ aapl $ qqq hft""
19. ""remember google glass ? regular people can no longer buy them $ goog URL URL""
20. ""fifth day of losses for stocks as banks and tech names drag $ bac $ c $ aapl $ amzn $ goog""

Okay, so I notice that the words like FB, AMZN, TSLA, GFTLX, NFLX are all present in these tweets. So it seems like the target stock is Facebook (FB) or maybe another company related to tech.

Looking at each tweet:

1-3: All mention FB and other tech stocks.
4-6: Same as 1-3.
5: Same, but shorter.
7-8: Both mention different companies but include FB. Wait, tweet 8 says ""baba"" instead of FB, which might be a typo or variation.

So perhaps all these tweets are from Facebook (FB) and other tech companies like AMZN, TSLA, etc.

Now, each tweet has factors:

For example, in tweet 7: trading at 100.49, 149 bpts above FV, p/B ratio of 98.00, and valuations at certain percentages for GFTLX, AMZN, TSLA, etc.

So these are factors that might influence price.

The overall message seems to be a negative outlook on the tech sector, talking about FAANG companies (like FB, AMZN) being successful despite losses in some industries like banking. So perhaps investors expect more growth but face headwinds from certain sectors or regions.

The positive tweets are more about Facebook and other tech companies, while the negative ones talk about general tech performance, FAANG stocks' valuation, etc.

So now, to determine if these factors will lead to a rise or fall in stock prices:

1. 1-3: Positive mentions of FAANG stocks (FB, AMZN, TSLA) which are strong in the market and expected to grow.
2. 4-6: Same as above but shorter.
3. 7-8: Includes other tech companies but again, all FAANG.
4. 9-10: Talks about Facebook's performance over time, perhaps a longer-term perspective on technical stocks.

Looking at the valuation factors:

 tweet 7 mentions p/B ratio of 98.00, which is a standard valuation metric for tech stocks, lower than average but not extremely low. High p/B can indicate high valuations, suggesting potential for rise in price.

 tweet 12: ""c dti +40%"" and valuations at certain percentages. So cdti might be an acronym for something like cents delta interest? Or maybe a typo for something else?

Assuming cdti stands for some percentage point change (maybe 4% increase?), so the stock went up by 40%. Valuation percentages indicate that the stock is undervalued or overvalued compared to its earnings and book value.

 tweet 15: ""what google glass can learn from..."" which might be a more meta comment, perhaps pointing towards the importance of innovation or cutting-edge tech companies in driving market growth.

Overall trends:

- The tweets are mostly about FAANG stocks (FB, AMZN, TSLA) and other tech companies that are expected to grow. There's a general negative tone about some sectors' performance leading to losses but positive outlook on FAANGs.

Factors influencing price movement might be:

1. Positive mentions of FAANG stocks pushing their prices up.
2. Technical analysis suggesting they have potential for growth, possibly due to high p/B ratios and valuation metrics indicating undervaluation or overvaluation.
3. Meta comments about the importance of tech companies in driving innovation, which could encourage investors to see FAANGs as good buys.

So considering all these factors, it seems that while there's a general negative sentiment about certain industries (banking) with some positive momentum from tech stocks, FAANGs are expected to grow. If FAANGs have strong fundamentals and high p/B ratios, their price might rise despite some sectors being underperforming.

But without knowing the exact market conditions or specific valuations of these stocks, it's hard to predict for sure whether they'll go up or down.

However, given that Facebook itself is a major company in tech (Facebook has around $450 billion in revenue as of 2023), and FAANGs tend to have strong margins and significant market caps, even if some other tech companies are struggling, the general tech sector might still support these stocks. So maybe they'll rise.

But also, meta comments like ""remember Google Glass"" suggest that the tech community is increasingly focused on cutting-edge technologies beyond just the obvious FAANGs, which could encourage investors to see more of them as value-additions.

So overall, considering all these factors and trends, I might lean towards expecting a rise in prices for these tech companies, especially given their strong fundamentals. But without specific data or analysis, it's speculative."
2015-01-17,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out how the given tweets affect the stock price of a company. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'm supposed to extract the target stock from the tweets. Looking at tweet 1: ""get $ 25 when you sign up URL payoneer w / my link . available in over 200 countries worldwide ! bonus $ aapl $ googl $ goog"". Hmm, that mentions Payoneer and URLs, but it doesn't mention any stock names. Maybe I'm missing something here.

Looking at tweet 2: ""rt AT_USER . AT_USER earned $ 230.000 in ' 13 via various bug bounty programs and got $ 130k in total from $ goog URL"". This seems more clear. AT_USER is a company, so I can see that as the target stock. The tweet mentions they earned money through bug bounty programs and specifically refers to ""goog"" which usually stands for Google. So, the target stock is AT_USER.

Now, I need to analyze each tweet's factors and sentiment towards the stock.

Starting with tweet 1: It talks about a free signup offer from Payoneer and mentions specific companies (Apayoer, Aapl, A goog) but doesn't provide any information about the company whose tweets we're analyzing. Since this tweet isn't directly related to AT_USER, it might not have a significant impact on their stock price.

Moving to tweet 2: This one seems relevant because it mentions AT_USER and refers to Google (goog). The tweet also mentions $130k earned from ""bug bounty programs."" I'm not entirely sure about the specifics of the bug bounty programs but it suggests that AT_USER made money by participating in such programs. If there are positive developments, this could indicate growth or expansion.

Since tweet 2 is the only relevant one and provides information related to AT_USER, and assuming that earning money from bugs can sometimes be seen as a positive sign (as participation in bug bounty can lead to better tools which might improve services), I should consider this as a positive factor.

However, without specific details about their earnings growth or any other factors mentioned, it's hard to conclude definitively. But the tweet is directly related to the target stock and provides some context on how they made money, which could be seen as a potential benefit.

Putting it all together, while the information isn't conclusive, there are signs of positive developments for AT_USER, so I'd lean towards a positive overall sentiment."
2015-01-18,Neutral,"Alright, I'm looking at this query where I need to determine the impact of some tweets on a company's stock price. The user has provided a set of tweets and wants me to analyze their effect on future stock performance by classifying each as positive, neutral, or negative.

First, I'll start by identifying the target stock from the tweets. Looking at tweet 1, it mentions ""googl,"" which stands for Google, so the stock is Google. That's straightforward.

Next, I need to analyze each tweet individually. The first tweet reads: ""rt AT_USER $ googl $ goog $ fb $ yhoo النفط تداول اوبشن options الداو_جونز بفضل الله انتهينا من حضور محاضرة الأوبشن اشكر الحضور مستشا …"" Breaking this down, it seems to mention Google (googl), Facebook (fb), and YHOO (which I believe is also Google). It's talking about user-generated content and investor sentiment regarding options trading. It ends with an exclamation mark, which often indicates strong emotion.

I'll separate each tweet into positive or negative factors. The word "" Petroleum"" suggests potential challenges or difficulties in operations, which could be a negative factor. The mention of options trading might indicate risk, so that's another negative aspect. Also, the phrase ""جra Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah"" at the end seems overly enthusiastic and can be seen as positive.

Now, assessing the sentiment. There's a mix of negative factors like difficulty in operations and risk from options trading, but there are some positive elements, especially the enthusiastic closing line. I'm leaning towards a mixed overall sentiment because while there are some positive mentions, the underlying concerns about operations and risk might outweigh them.

So, weighing all these thoughts, the overall impact seems to be a mixed result. It's not entirely positive because of the operational challenges and risk involved, but it does include some optimism from the closing remark."
2015-01-19,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given tweets are likely to have a positive, neutral, or negative impact on a company's stock price. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol, which is $508.08. Hmm, that seems like an exchange rate or maybe some kind of price point? Wait, if it's $508.08, that might be related to a company's earnings or financial data. But I'm not sure yet.

Now, I'll go through each tweet one by one. 

The first tweet says ""$ goog is bearish @ $ 508.08 +1.25 % . latest mw story : URL URL"". Okay, so it mentions ""goog"" which could be Google, a well-known company. It's saying that the stock is bearish at $508.08 with a +1.25% increase. That's interesting because bearish indicators usually mean investors are worried about the company, which can sometimes lead to a dip in stock price. But I'm not entirely sure if just one tweet would be enough to affect the entire company.

The second tweet is ""$ goog - calendrier des sociétés sur 15 jours URL"". This looks like it's mentioning something related to government announcements about calendars or events happening on 15 days. If that affects Google, maybe some industry news affecting their operations? Again, I'm not certain how this would directly impact the stock price unless there's a significant event.

I should also consider other factors. Maybe the company has a recent news event that's being discussed here. But without more context, it's hard to tell. Also, the symbols used like ""mw story"" or ""URL"" might refer to unrelated content, so I shouldn't take those too seriously.

Looking at the output requirement, I need to determine if these tweets suggest a positive, neutral, or negative trend on their stock price impact. The first tweet is quite specific with the percentage increase but it's a bearish statement, which could mean that overall investors might not be confident in Google's future performance. However, without more context about what ""mw story"" refers to, I can't be certain if it's affecting other aspects of Google.

The second tweet seems less specific. It mentions an event on 15 days, but again, without knowing the exact impact or any related news that might influence the stock price, it's hard to assess.

Putting it all together, both tweets seem like they're talking about external events that could potentially affect the company. They don't directly mention a positive or negative performance metric, just statements about their performance based on some metrics or upcoming events. Therefore, without more information, I think these tweets are likely not strongly influencing the stock price positively, neutrally, or negatively."
2015-01-20,Positive,"Alright, I need to determine the likely impact of these tweets on the stock price of a given company based on the provided information. The user has already outlined a process: extract the target stock symbol from each tweet and analyze each tweet individually as factors (positive or negative) and then assess the sentiment.

Looking at the tweets, the first step is to identify the target stock. From the tweets, I notice that there are no specific stock symbols listed directly. However, some mentions of Google (GOOG) are present in multiple tweets. Specifically, tweet 1 mentions ""r & d"" line and other keywords related to tech companies. Another mention is tweet 4 which includes ""gfsat"" as part of a URL, but that doesn't seem to be a company name. Similarly, some tweets talk about investment amounts or other topics unrelated to Google.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one to identify the factors and sentiment.

1. **Tweet 1**: Talks about AT_USER talking about tech trends, spending on R&D, and investing in companies like NVIDIA (NVIDIA) and Tesla. Not specific to a company.
2. **Tweet 2**: Has no mention of a stock.
3. **Tweet 3**: Mentions investment in SpaceX (QCOM), Tesla, and Apollo Space Exploration (LORL). Again, not a company.
4. **Tweet 4**: Focuses on free tutorials for traders, so not relevant to a specific stock.
5. **Tweet 5**: Discusses brokers for trading stocks. No specific stock mentioned.
6. **Tweet 6**: Mentions Google investing $1 billion in SPACX (SPAX). This is a specific investment amount related to Google.
7. **Tweet 7**: Reiterates tweet 6, likely the same information.
8. **Tweet 8 and 9**: Mention of FNT and other stocks but not clearly tied to Google or any known company.
9. **Tweet 10**: Similar to tweet 6, rephrasing the investment amount but again about Google.
10. **Tweet 11**: Talks about spacex raising $1 billion from Google and Fidelity. Not specifically Google.
11. **Tweet 12-14**: Discusses Apple's guidance for March quarters without specific company names.

From this, it appears that the tweets are focused on Google-related topics: investments in SPACX (SPAX), Tesla (TSLA), SpaceX (QCOM), and related companies. There's no mention of any other stock explicitly. Since these tweets are about investment strategies and future guidance for investors, they seem to be positive in nature.

Investors looking at these tweets might see them as signals to buy Google shares because they indicate potential investments or goals. Therefore, the sentiment is likely positive towards Google's stock price."
2015-01-21,Positive,"Alright, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me start by analyzing each tweet individually.

First tweet says, ""it's france vs , $ goog in a battle over a whopping tax bill."" The mention of France and Google working together on taxes shows a positive relationship with Google's financials. This could boost investor confidence, suggesting a positive sentiment.

Second tweet is a retweet of the first one: ""rt AT_USER spacex has raised $ 1 billion from google $ goog and fidelity in a deal that values the spaceship manufacturer at about $ 10 …"". The mention of Fidelity contributing to the funding indicates a positive investment, which could be seen as favorable for Google's valuation. Additionally, it highlights strategic partnerships with investors, which is a good sign.

Both tweets point towards a favorable view of Google, either through tax collaboration or strategic financial arrangements. These seem to indicate confidence and potential growth, so the stock is likely to increase."
2015-01-22,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets about Google's stock price to determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

Starting with tweet 1: It says that $ goog could snatch $ twtr up and mentions holding on to some calls as a lotto ticket. That sounds like a vague call to action, which might not have much sentiment. The user is trying to influence the stock price but doesn't specify an opinion on its positive or negative.

Then tweet 2 talks about the top three takeaways from eBay's earnings report. This seems like a news announcement, so it could be positive if they're expected to improve, but without context, I'm not sure how much impact this has. It might just be reporting on something that's already known or upcoming.

Tweet 3 mentions an event with sigma-x, crossfinder, ats, lx, p/t levels crossing 111 and including several companies. This looks like technical analysis indicators, which are often used by investors to gauge market trends. They can be supportive of stock movements but don't directly indicate a positive or negative outlook on Google.

Tweet 4 is similar to tweet 3 but includes more specific companies. It's still about analyzing technical data points that could influence future prices, so again, not giving a direct sentiment like positive or negative.

Tweet 5 has a short quote related to G PRO and mentions stock prices fluctuating between $119.50 and $14:00. This is likely a dummy tweet, just making up numbers without any significant information about the stock price.

Tweet 6 again refers to technical indicators on Google's stock and includes some dates. It seems like another set of facts that could be used by analysts but doesn't give a clear opinion on whether to buy or sell.

Tweet 7 asks if Google can rise over 20% in 2015, which is speculation about the company's growth potential. This adds uncertainty and might not have a significant positive or negative impact yet.

Tweet 8 mentions buyout rumors, but without context or specific details on what those rumors are about, it's hard to assess the sentiment. It could be interpreted either way, making it difficult to determine if it affects the stock price positively or negatively.

Lastly, tweet 9 talks about another set of technical points, similar to tweets 3 and 4. These are again data points that could influence future prices but don't provide a clear indication of positive or negative sentiment.

After going through all eight tweets, I'm noticing that each is either reporting on past events, discussing upcoming news, or making speculative statements about potential growth. None of them give clear information about the current stock's performance. They might be trying to provide context for future analysis but don't offer a definitive opinion. Therefore, it seems like these tweets are neutral in their impact."
2015-01-23,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of BABA (BABA). 

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Scanning through the tweets, it seems all the relevant stocks mentioned are 'baba', like in tweet 1: $ baba. So that's our target stock.

Now, for each tweet, I should separate them into positive and negative factors. Let me go one by one:

1. The first tweet talks about BABA trading above its f/v and p/t ratio with other companies. That usually shows some consistency in the stock price relative to its performance metrics. Positive.
2. Same as tweet 1; it's another comment on trading ratios. Still positive.
3. Again, similar to the first two, focusing on trade patterns. Still a positive sentiment.
4. Yet another repeat of the same point about trade patterns with other companies. Consistent with positives.
5. This tweet mentions key stocks like ABL and GOO with buy/sell signals for Friday. Buy signals are usually good because they indicate potential buying pressure which can influence stock prices positively. So, positive sentiment here.
6. Similar to others but again focusing on trade patterns. Still positive.
7. Another buy signal tweet about Google using Etoro. Positive as it shows interest and a strategy. Positive.
8. The tweet mentions anagrams between Google's performance and Wi-Fi tech. Anagrams can sometimes be misleading, but the context of stock trading suggests genuine interest, so positive sentiment.
9. This tweet is about BABA related to sigma-x and crossfinder. It says something about a sigma-x trade being triggered by Apple's patent portfolio offering clues on future production. Positive because it shows technical analysis, which can influence market movement positively. 
10. A new post announcing Google trading updates. Positive as updating the stock price or activity is typically seen as positive.
11. Another one focusing on trade patterns. Positive again.
12. Same as tweet 11; consistent positive comments about trade ratios.
13. This seems like a blog post suggesting that Apple's growing patent portfolio could hint at future Google developments. Since this is a personal observation, it might not directly impact the stock price but shows interest in tech, which can be neutral or slightly positive.

Now, for overall sentiment: Tweets 5 and 9 are about buy signals, which generally indicate good momentum and are strong positive indicators. The rest focus on trade patterns or technical analysis but don't express a clear trend upward or downward. Some mention personal observations, like the blog post, which might be neutral since they're speculative and not direct market movements.

So overall, considering that there are buy signals which boost sentiment positively, even though other factors are mixed, it leans towards a positive impact."
2015-01-24,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol in the tweets: $ goog. Hmm, that could refer to the stock symbol for Google. Wait, but usually, the symbol is $500 or something, not $goog. Maybe it's a typo and they meant GOGGL instead? Or maybe it's representing Google's initials, which are G and O. But regardless, let's focus on the factors mentioned.

The tweets have two main points:
1. ""us what google's wireless plans mean for verizon , at & t and you google inc URL sp500""
2. The output requires a conclusion with [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative].

So, I need to analyze each tweet and see how they might influence the stock price.

Starting with the first tweet: ""$ goog : us what google's wireless plans mean for verizon , at & t and you google inc URL sp500""

This seems a bit confusing. It mentions Google's wireless plans affecting Verizon, AT&T, and itself regarding the S&P 500 (SP500). But I'm not sure how this directly affects the stock price of any company. Maybe it's trying to suggest that Google is investing or planning for the future based on wireless tech, which could impact the overall market but doesn't directly target a specific stock.

But wait, since the user specified the target stock symbol is $ goog, maybe the stock in question is GOGGL or something else. However, without more context, it's hard to say. Perhaps I should assume that this tweet is more about market trends rather than a specific company's performance.

The second tweet seems irrelevant because it doesn't specify any action on a particular stock. It just talks about Google's wireless plans and investments in the market.

So, considering all of this, since none of the tweets seem to provide information about a specific company's stock price movement or positive/negative news related to that company, the overall sentiment remains neutral.

Therefore, I should conclude that the tweet doesn't provide enough information about the stock price impact on any particular company."
2015-01-25,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for Apple. First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet, it mentions ""momo trade this week"" and talks about a $100% retrace in value, but it doesn't explicitly name the stock. Hmm, maybe I should check if there's another obvious target. The second tweet is from analysts predicting Apple sold $44 billion of iphones last quarter for context on revenue expectations. That sounds familiar; that's definitely Apple's stock.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one. The first tweet talks about a stock symbol ""momo trade"" with a 100% retrace, which doesn't seem relevant to Apple. The second is from the analysts, predicting apple's revenue last quarter and setting expectations for future earnings. That definitely relates to Apple.

The third tweet mentions some percentage changes on Saturday, January 24, but again, it doesn't specify Apple. The fourth tweet discusses earnings for various companies, so Apple is mentioned here with specific dates like Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc. It talks about earnings and investor attention from the fed. That's interesting because higher earnings might be good news.

The fifth tweet provides a market snapshot on February 5th, mentioning that Apple is earning and the Fed has views on investor attention. This is pointing towards positive trends for Apple as it reports on its financials.

Now, combining all these factors: the analysts' earnings prediction is positive, showing strong performance. The market is optimistic about future earnings, which can be a good sign. Apple's stock might recover from any potential dip and perform well relative to peers like Google. Considering all these signals—reinforcement of positive earnings reports, potential for a retrace in value, and ongoing investor interest—the overall sentiment seems positive."
2015-01-26,Positive,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to analyze a set of tweets and determine their impact on a company's stock price, specifically for the given example with [MSFT]. They provided three tweets, and I need to extract the stock symbol from them.

First, looking at each tweet: 

1. ""option millionaires : nlightn : $ goog , ... not only is google preparing a new cellphone URL""
   - The company here seems to be Google (GOOG). It mentions something about option millionaires and an upcoming new cell phone URL. That's positive because it could lead to increased revenue or market share growth.

2. ""rt AT_USER oh boy , its earnings week ! $ msft monday $ aapl tuesday $ fb wednesday $ goog thursday ... cocktails for tech-biz reporters frida …""
   - This one is about Microsoft (MSFT). The user is calling it an ""earnings week,"" which usually signals good financial performance. That's positive because earnings can boost stock prices.

3. ""when will oil bottom ? outcomes and potential impacts of greek elections URL $ goog $ sndk investing""
   - Again, Google is mentioned here with mentions of oil prices and Greek elections. A positive outlook on the oil price could indicate economic growth, which might positively affect Google's performance as well.

Considering each tweet individually: all mention Google. The first tweet talks about Google's future plans, suggesting growth potential. The second tweet highlights earnings, which can boost stock value. The third also ties into a positive outlook due to economic factors like oil prices and elections.

There are no negative or neutral sentiments here. All tweets are reinforcing Google's prospects through different signals—preserving the current market view of positive trends."
2015-01-27,Negative,"Alright, let's tackle this analysis problem step by step. I'm given 15 tweets related to stock market news, and I need to determine their impact on the stock price for a specific company. The user mentioned that the target stock symbol isn't provided here, but they also asked me to extract it from the tweets. However, looking at the tweets, I can see mentions of ""goog"", ""msft"" (Microsoft), ""appl"" (Apple), and ""fb"" (Facebook). It seems like ""Google"" might be the target company.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking through each tweet, I notice that some mention ""goog URL"" and others use ""google"". I think ""goog"" is the standard abbreviation for Google in these contexts. So, the target stock is likely Google (GOOG).

Now, I'll go through each tweet one by one to determine their impact.

1. The first tweet says Google will announce expansion in four out of nine cities. It seems like this could be positive as it's a positive development.
2. Similar to the first tweet, it confirms Google's expansion plans and is likely to boost investor confidence.
3. This tweet updates on recent news about 2015 but doesn't mention anything relevant to Google or its stock. It might be too vague, so I'll consider this as neutral.
4. Another update related to Google's earnings, which usually can be positive for the company.
5. This tweet mentions rotation into Google and other stocks, suggesting a headwind from dilution.
6. Again, an announcement about Google's fiber expansion in four cities, reinforcing the positive news.
7. Similar to tweet 3, it just confirms the expansion but doesn't provide specific info on Google's performance.
8. Mention of Windows updates for Microsoft and Google's podcasts, which is more about corporate news than stock performance.
9. Discussing Google's earnings and potential rotation into other stocks, indicating a potential negative impact due to dilution.
10. More details on Google's fiber expansion in specific cities, so positive.
11. A tweet questioning Google's earnings, but it doesn't specify the outcome or impact.
12. Exclusive update about biobio collaboration with Google and Facebook, which could indicate innovation and future growth.
13. Again, mentions Google's expansion without specific info on performance.
14. Updating about Google's stock prices for AlphaStuff, MSFT, NFLX, etc., but this seems more like corporate news rather than market sentiment.
15. An announcement regarding fiber internet in multiple cities, which is positive.

Now, I'll assess each tweet's impact:

1. Positive (expansion planned)
2. Positive
3. Neutral
4. Positive
5. Negative (dilution)
6. Positive
7. Neutral
8. No specific info, so neutral
9. Negative
10. Positive
11. Neutral
12. Positive (innovation collaboration)
13. Positive
14. No clear info on performance
15. Positive

Putting it all together, most tweets are positive except for some that mention dilution or less specific information. The overall sentiment seems to be a mix of positive and slightly negative factors.

Considering the overall sentiment, while there's room for uncertainty due to some tweets indicating dilution, the majority suggest potential growth from expansion efforts and innovative collaborations. However, without concrete data on earnings, it might not be enough to strongly lean into a positive or negative stance overall."
2015-01-28,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on stock prices for a given company. The user provided 11 tweets, each presumably related to different stocks or news about them. My task is to evaluate the overall sentiment of all these tweets together.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. However, looking through the tweets, it seems that some of them are more general and mention other companies like GOOG (Google), SPXL (Spx), MNK (Maverick Knives), etc., without specifying which stock. This makes me unsure about the exact company whose stock is being analyzed here.

Assuming each tweet is referring to a different stock, I'll need to find out what each stock symbol stands for and then assess each tweet's sentiment towards that particular stock. However, since not all tweets specify the target stock clearly, this complicates things because I don't know which stock each tweet is targeting.

For example, tweet 1 mentions ""this state could be next 2 legalize pot ? URL gov co"" which seems unrelated to a specific stock symbol. Similarly, some tweets like ""RT AT_USER google earnings preview"" might not specify the target stock but are discussing Google-related topics.

Given this uncertainty, it's hard to pinpoint the exact stock whose tweet is influencing its price. Without knowing which stock each tweet is targeting, I can't accurately assess their impact on that particular company's future stock price. 

However, perhaps there's a pattern or common thread in some of these tweets. For instance, tweets like ""rt AT_USER mega cap stocks to buy : up to 16.35 % return in 14 days URL algorithm money $ tsm $ goog"" might be targeting stocks that investors are considering for purchase based on expected returns and their trading strategies.

But without clear identification of the target stock, it's challenging to determine if these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative regarding any specific company. Therefore, I might have to make an assumption or note that more information is needed about each tweet's target stock to accurately assess its impact.

In conclusion, while some tweets seem related to broader market trends or company performance, without knowing the exact target stock, it's impossible to determine their overall impact on a single stock's future price. I might have to suggest that further information is required for an accurate assessment."
2015-01-29,Negative,"Okay, I need to figure out the likely impact of these tweets on the stock price of Google. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet mentions ""whisper number"" but doesn't provide enough information.
2. The second tweet talks about the digital advertising industry and how the $ goog call is crucial for their direction.
3. The third tweet discusses AT_USER's query, mentioning Q4 EPS missed by $ 0.20 and revenue growth of +16.9%.
4. The fourth tweet says mic sales are up early in the quarters.
5. The fifth tweet provides a new alert about Google's earnings on NASDAQ.
6. The sixth tweet mentions Greece, McDonald's shaking hack, and $ goog, but no details.
7. The seventh tweet talks about Google CEO's statement about bad numbers rolling over.
8. The eighth tweet asks for opinions to decide if $ goog is a buy, hold, or sell.
9. The ninth tweet states that Google-owned sites generated $12.44 billion in Q4 revenue.
10. The tenth tweet reports $ goog and $ amzn earnings but doesn't mention social sentiment about the stocks.
11. The eleventh tweet notes Facebook's higher earnings with increased costs.
12. The twelfth tweet mentions a filing for Google's 8-K.
13. The thirteenth tweet states that Google's Q4 eps is $6.88.
14. The fourteenth tweet talks about a Q&A session with investors.
15. The fifteenth tweet provides another alert on Google earnings at NASDAQ.
16. The sixteenth tweet mentions Facebook's decent report and futures moving up.

Looking at each tweet, most are informational but not necessarily positive or negative. Some mention earnings increases (like $ goog + $ googl), which could indicate growth. The sixth tweet mentions Greek debt and McDonald's, which might affect the market negatively due to economic factors. The fourth tweet about mic sales being up early is speculative.

However, without specific numbers or clear statements from investors, it's hard to determine if there are significant shifts in sentiment. The overall sentiment isn't strongly positive or negative based on these tweets."
2015-01-30,Neutral,"Alright, let's analyze these tweets step by step to determine their impact on the stock price of the company in question.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet because it seems like they all mention Google. From tweet 1, the stock is $GOOGL. So, my focus is on $GOOGL's performance.

Looking at each tweet:

1. ""i see $ goog stable and steady build up all morning"" - This mentions Google but doesn't specify if it's positive or negative. It suggests a slight upward trend.
2. ""glassdoor ’ s top 25 most difficult companies to interview $ goog $ hubs $ cat $ msft $ payc $ rr URL employeesatisfaction"" - This is more about employees at Glassdoor, not directly about Google, so maybe not relevant for the stock price impact.
3. ""rt AT_USER yes i liked $ goog and $ amzn and $ v and listened to them as i signed getrichcarefully for new URL subscri …"" - The mention of Google's stock is here but lacks context on how it's affecting investors.
4. ""rt AT_USER analysts are baffled that google ' can't beat an earnings report ' URL $ goog $ googl URL"" - The analyst's frustration might indicate concerns about Google's performance, which could be positive or negative depending on the outcome of their earnings.
5. ""rt AT_USER apple's profit : $ 18b google's revenue : $ 18b but $ aapl is just worth 2x $ goog ¯ \ _ ( ツ ) _ / ¯ AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER"" - Comparing Apple to Google, with Google at 2x revenue. This could suggest a positive outlook for Google based on their performance relative to competitors.
6. ""recap : closing bell happyhour 1/29 $ djia up on jobs data , stocks up on major earnings $ baba $ goog $ mcd URL"" - Here, the company names like BABA and MCD are mentioned along with stock movements. This indicates investor interest in these companies.
7. ""$ goog news : "" 40 - point after hours range for $ goog . tanked on initial earnings … "" URL board view : URL"" - The article talks about Google's financials, specifically mentioning a tanking due to earnings, which might be negative.
8. ""$ amzn & $ goog up big . $ aapl green . $ xom was green . financials , esp . canadian ones getting smoked . es down 1 % … see the problem here."" - Both Google and Amazon are up, while XOM is down. This could imply positive growth for Google as part of a broader economic trend.
9. ""google's cash is real . $ goog $ googl aapl URL"" - Mentioning Google's financials and another stock might indicate investor confidence in their performance.
10. ""rt AT_USER in its fourth quarter earnings , google’s revenue continued to disappoint URL $ goog URL"" - The mention of disappointing revenue could be negative, indicating potential for price drops if the company doesn't meet expectations.
11. ""$ goog shorts dont realize that numberz dont matter , $ spy $ ndaq skyrocketing ah and shyt , everyone needz sumthin 2 buy no matter wut 2morrow"" - This tweet seems to focus on tech stocks, suggesting a mix of positive and negative signals about the market.
12. ""$ spy $ qqq $ goog $ fb jaiant 101 became a registered member URL"" - More about other tech stocks, possibly indicating interest in Google but not directly impacting its stock price.
13. ""zivvond : AT_USER mid-day penny stock pick on $ etbi gained 23.27 % for us ! big news : URL $ ibm $ goog $ aapl""

Each tweet is either talking about Glassdoor employees or tech stocks, with some discussing earnings and financials. The majority of these tweets are positive about Google's performance relative to competitors and in terms of revenue. There's also a mention of investor sentiment being mixed due to earnings reports from competitors.

Considering all the factors—positive comparisons with competitors like Apple and BABA, positive mention of cash on Google's financials, and some negative comments about earnings—there doesn't seem to be a clear overall trend that would significantly impact the stock price. The market seems to be cautious, with some optimism but also signs of uncertainty due to competitor performance.

So, putting it all together, the overall sentiment is neutral."
2015-01-31,Negative,"Alright, so I have to figure out how the given tweets affect the stock price of a company. The user provided six tweets and wants me to determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative in impact on the stock's future price.

First, I need to extract the target stock from each tweet. Let's go through them one by one.

1. ""nasdaq 100 recent market exit 2 : covered $ goog short for a 6.10 % gain in 52 days . goog forex trading stocks"" – The keyword here is $ goog, so I think the stock in question is Google (GOOG). It mentions covering $ goog short for a gain, which suggests investors are selling shares of Google.

2. ""join me on tsū , is sharing social revenues with all of us . URL $ lnkd $ aapl $ googl $ goog $ fb $ yhoo URL"" – This tweet has several dollar signs: $ googl and $ yhoo. I'm not sure what the user is referring to here. It seems like Google is mentioned multiple times, maybe as part of a stock pick or something else.

3. ""two senators have proposed a tax holiday tech companies would love URL $ aapl $ goog $ msft"" – Again, $ googl is in there. This tweet suggests that two senators are proposing a tax break for tech companies, which might encourage investors to buy more shares of Google.

4. ""key trading stocks like $ aapl and $ goog with buy and sell signals for monday : URL"" – Here, $ aapl is mentioned. If this is referring to the Apple (APL) stock, then there are buy and sell signals for Monday. This would likely indicate that investors have some expectations about Monday's trading.

5. ""rt AT_USER google rallies after earnings report week -0.8 % ytd +1.3 % $ googl $ goog $ qqq $ xlk android internet URL"" – The keyword is $ googl. It mentions Google rejoining the market and a rally post-earnings. A rally usually indicates positive sentiment, which can be a good sign for future price.

6. ""our penny stock picks gained an overall 160 % this week ! new picks coming : URL $ trx $ aapl $ goog"" – This has $ trx, $ aapl, and $ goog. The presence of Google makes me think again about the first tweet where Google was covered short. A big gain in penny stocks could be positive if it's due to increased demand or other factors.

Now, let me summarize each tweet:

1. Google short position, 6% gain target date.
2. Has $ googl mentioned multiple times.
3. Two senators propose tax break for tech companies.
4. Buy signals for Monday.
5. Google rallies after earnings.
6. Penny stocks gained a lot, possibly because of Google.

Considering the first tweet, Google is shorted and expects a 6% gain in 52 days. Short selling can be seen as bearish but might suggest uncertainty about future prices. However, it's important to note that shorting doesn't always indicate negative sentiment; it just means they're betting against the stock.

The second tweet mentions $ googl, which I think refers to Google. This could mean a positive sentiment if there's a rally after earnings or other positive developments related to Google.

The third tweet is about tax incentives for tech companies, which can boost demand and be seen as positive by investors looking for better opportunities.

The fourth tweet has buy signals on Monday, indicating potential buying pressure which might signal a positive trend for the stock.

The fifth tweet is about Google rejoining the market after earnings. This could mean confidence in their future performance, which is good for price.

The sixth tweet mentions new penny stocks gaining 160%, which is significant and could be due to increased demand, especially if related to Google's performance or other factors.

Putting it all together: The tweets are mostly focused on Google's performance, either shorting expectations, positive signals, or rally after earnings. Each suggests some optimism about the stock but doesn't necessarily contradict each other. The main themes are a mix of bearish (short) and bullish (penny stocks gaining) factors.

Therefore, the overall sentiment is mixed but leans towards a combination of bearish and bullish elements, which could make it neutral because there's ambiguity in how these factors affect the stock price."
2015-02-01,Neutral,"Alright, I need to figure out how to analyze the impact on the stock price of the given company based on these tweets. Let me start by looking at each tweet and breaking down their components.

The first tweet mentions ""rt AT_USER"" and talks about 57% since the user's inception regarding capital gains. It lists some stocks with symbols like $goog, $apl, etc., which are known to fluctuate in value. The sentiment here seems positive because it's talking about future gains from the user's perspective.

The second tweet is another RT, starting with ""great free tutorial here for traders"" and listing a list of stocks including $nflx, $bac, etc., same as the first one. This also sounds like a positive signal to buy these stocks since it provides information that can be beneficial to investors.

The third tweet says something about AT_USER saying Google's chairman Eric Schmidt is resigning. The link mentions ""googl"" and ""goog,"" which are Google's stock symbols. A resignation might imply some changes in company strategy or management, which could affect the stock price. However, it doesn't specify whether this will improve or hurt the company.

Now, combining these three tweets. The first two seem to be positive signals for trading. The third tweet adds uncertainty about Google's leadership, which is a bit of a negative note but not enough to outweigh the initial buy signals.

I'm leaning towards a positive overall sentiment because there are clear buy signals from both users. However, the mention of a chairman resignation introduces some doubt, so it might slightly be neutral."
2015-02-02,Positive,"Okay, so I need to determine the impact of these tweets on a company's stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the target stock is mentioned in the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER who won the social super bowl ? URL $ fb $ twtr $ goog"". The user mentions that they won the Super Bowl and links to some stocks like FB, TWTR, and GOOG. So, these are positive signs because gaining recognition on a popular event can boost investor confidence.

Next, looking at the second tweet: ""$ goog : gapdn 2.72 [ -0.5 % , fill : 54 % ] , prvcl : 534.52 , prvlo : 515.52 , pdaygp + , alltfs + , bigflt : 574m , p $ vol : 1158.87 m ; tlm : 1.9 ; ilm : 2.7"". This seems to provide detailed financial metrics like price, volume, and market trends. Positive factors here could indicate growth potential.

The third tweet is a bit confusing: ""find active and helpful professional daytraders stock traders here URL $ goog $ aapl $ qqq URL"". The user is asking for trading URLs, which might imply they're looking to engage with other traders. This suggests a possible increase in activity among the company's team or potential buyers, possibly indicating positive sentiment.

Lastly, the fourth tweet: ""rt AT_USER me buy every dip .. $ goog $ fb $ aapl $ amzn $ biib"". Similar to the third tweet, it's asking for more trades and mentions several stocks. This could mean that users are looking to trade these stocks frequently, which might indicate a strong buying intent, contributing to positive market sentiment.

Now, considering all these factors: The first tweet shows gains in FB, TWTR, and GOOG, second has financial indicators, third suggests trading activity, and fourth is about buying dips. These points all point towards a positive outlook for the stock."
2015-02-03,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out the impact of these tweets on Google's stock price. I'll take each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet is about $ googl short-term bulls hoping Google goes after Uber. Positive because they're worried about Uber's issues but not sure if it's a good move yet.
2. Second tweet talks about the market being poised to start, mentioning options and millionaires. Neutral as it’s just an update without specific actions or sentiment shifts.
3. Third tweet says AT_USER morphing into MSFT with copying another company's business model. Positive because it looks like a plan could be in place.
4. Fourth tweet mentions a short setup for tomorrow with a 60% success rate since inception, including stocks and sector names. Positive because indicating potential gains are expected.
5. Fifth tweet lists multiple companies, so not sure about each one individually but overall looking positive as they all seem good.
6. Sixth is about logging into live chat and mentioning options stocks and daytrading. Neutral as it's more of a call to action rather than analysis.
7. Seventh tweet says bearishness in Google dropped 65% compared to the past four weeks, which is significant. That’s definitely negative because a big drop suggests concerns about the stock.
8. Eighth tweet questions self-driving cars and whether Google will go for Uber over them. Neutral because it's more of an opinion than a direct action on stock performance.
9. Ninth tweet says Google is challengingUber despite investments, but not sure if that affects their survival. It’s ambiguous without context.
10. Tenth tweet mentions tax to grind; no indication of a specific plan or stock movement here.
11. Twelfth tweet asks whether it will survive and the URL seems irrelevant.

So combining all these, while Google is looking for potential opportunities with Uber (positive), there's a bearish indicator from the seventh tweet about Google's performance. The overall sentiment isn't entirely positive because of the bearishness, which might weigh on the stock price negatively."
2015-02-04,Negative,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how the given tweets affect the stock price of some company. The task is to determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative based on these tweets. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol isn't provided here, but maybe that won't matter since I'm focusing on sentiment rather than specific stocks. Each tweet seems like a news event that might influence investor sentiment.

Starting with the first tweet: ""speculative trading rocks ! URL $ goog $ pcln $ twtr $ fb $ aapl $ ebay $ gm $ dust $ baba URL"". It mentions several companies under the Google logo and stock ticker symbols. Since speculative trading is about buying stocks without much consideration, I'm thinking this could be positive news if it's expected to drive up stock prices or lower costs.

The second tweet: ""$ nbg news updated wednesday , february 4 , 2015 06:11 : 19 am $ goog $ fb $ odp $ bib URL"". It updates a news event on February 4, 2015. That sounds like a specific date and time, so maybe it's confirming some news which could be neutral or positive depending on the context.

Third tweet: ""google search now has a built-in mortgage calculator $ goog URL via AT_USER"". Here, Google is mentioned as having a tool for calculating mortgages. If it's a good update that helps people with their finances, this could boost the stock positively because more investors might see value in such tools.

Fourth tweet: ""rt $ qqq algos triggered sell in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 14:08 , p / t 101.50 quant $ goog $ baba $ fb $ nflx $ bidu $ gpro $ tsla $ aapl hft"". RT probably refers to Reddit, and the quotes are from various platforms. The mention of stock selling due to some algorithm triggers might indicate negative news if it's expected to cause sell-offs. Alternatively, if it's a genuine event without context, it could be neutral.

Fifth tweet: ""AT_USER 3 ago $ any $ goog $ msft $ dell URL … URL chromebooks windows virtualization"". This mentions AT_USER, which is likely Reddit or another platform. The date being in March and the mention of MSFT (Microsoft) and DELL (General Electric) suggests tech-related news. If there's a significant event affecting these companies, it could be positive for the stock.

Sixth tweet: ""the morning dump - feb 4th spinoff $ yhoo adblock $ goog $ msft $ aapl $ ibm $ amzn kindle wearable ipad URL"". It mentions YHOO, ADBLOCK, and others. A spin-off event could mean something is being sold off, which might lead to profit or loss in the stock.

Now, combining all these tweets, they seem to be spreading information about Google's products, financial services, tech companies, and some market events. The mention of mortgage calculators and financial tools in the third tweet is promising for a positive outlook. The specific dates and topics don't necessarily indicate negative news, but if things are improving or better products come out, that could boost sentiment.

However, there's also mentions of stocks being sold off in spin-offs (fifth tweet) and potential profit from tech events (sixth). This could lead to selling these stocks, which is generally a negative sentiment for the stock price. But I'm not sure if all the tweets are providing buy signals or just confirming information.

Considering all factors, while some positive updates like mortgage calculators and tech developments are there, the mention of spin-offs suggests potential sell-offs, which could be counteracting the positive aspects. This balance makes me lean towards a negative overall sentiment."
2015-02-05,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about stock prices for Apple Inc. 

First, I need to identify each tweet and determine if it has any positive, negative, or neutral impact. The goal is to combine the sentiment from all relevant tweets.

Looking at tweet 1: It mentions a deal showing up in Google's search results via Twitter user accounts. This seems like good news because it's about a major tech company, so Apple might see gains. So that's positive.

Tweet 2: It says tweets will soon appear in Google searches again. That reinforces the positive sentiment since more users are interested, which could boost demand for Apple stock. Positive.

Tweet 3: The expert weighs in on the deal URL. Consistent with tweet 1 and 2—more likely to be positive as it's about a major deal.

 Tweet 4: $ twtr jumps because of new Google search deal. Directly linked, so definitely positive.

Tweet 5: Multiple stocks like Aapl,goog,intc,mtw etc., will have URLs in Google searches. This is good news for the stock market overall, which should be positive.

Tweet 6: Talks about Apple's stock prices on various platforms. It mentions daily lows and some quant analysis, but it doesn't specify if they're up or down. However, since other tweets are positive (tweets 1-5), this could affect investor sentiment.

Tweet 7: AT_USER is logging into option millionaires' live chat. This sounds like a promotional move or user engagement. It might not directly impact stock prices but could attract users who care about the stock.

Tweet 8: Indicates that five people were charged for ID theft, bought gift cards from Apple, and are involved in that. While this is serious news related to Apple's financials, it's more about incidents and doesn't directly affect the stock price unless there's a public statement or announcement. It seems less likely to be positive because of the negative impact on customers.

Tweet 9: Discusses QQQ trading above its target price with some quant analysis. This is interesting but neutral because it's about stock performance, not directly about the company itself.

Tweet 10: Talks about using Google influence to make profits and split assets. This could be positive if Apple sees this as a way to increase dividends or profits, which would benefit investors. But it's speculative and might not have a clear impact on the stock price without more context.

Now, let's summarize the sentiment:

Tweets 1-5: Positive (4 positive tweets)
Tweet 6: Partially negative due to the low prices but also influenced by other tweets.
Tweets 7: Promotional move, less likely to be impactful
Tweets 8: Negative incident affecting customers, which could have a ripple effect
Tweets 9: Neutral (just about trading at target price)
Tweet 10: Speculative and unclear impact

Considering all these, the positive tweets are enough to outweigh the negative incidents in tweet 8. The other tweets either support Apple's stock or are neutral.

So overall sentiment should be positive because the main positive tweets dominate despite one incident."
2015-02-06,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided nine tweets, each with some content, but no specific stock name. So, first, I need to identify which tweet mentions a specific stock symbol or company.

Looking through the tweets:

1. "" $ xle filings updated friday , february 6 , 2015 3:03 : 19 pm $ goog $ xli $ xlb $ rsx URL""
   - This seems like it's about XLE filings, which might relate to a stock symbol. The mention of Google makes me think of XLI as part of the S&P 500.

2. "" $ twtr and $ goog signed a thing . URL""
   - TwTR is a company known for its video games, particularly The Sims. They are sometimes referred to by their stock ticker, so this tweet mentionsgoog and possibly twtr.

3. "" $ twtr $ goog : morning biz digest : anthem didn't encrypt data stolen in hack ( video ): URL""
   - Again, multiple words with goog likely referencing Google's stock.

4. "" rt AT_USER why google glass broke more on failure of googleglass this time by AT_USER $ goog URL URL""
   - This is about an article or event related to Google products or their services.

5. "" rt AT_USER $ twtr on $ goog deal : we have the ' opportunity to aggregate eyeballs to logged out experiences , topics and events .""
   - Discusses a deal between TwTR and Google, involving交易。

6. "" ipad sales are going to get demolished this year , says the world's most accurate apple analyst : URL $ aapl $ goog $ pcln $ k""
   - Focus on Apple (AAPL), an unrelated stock.

7. "" AT_USER cnbc discussing ongoing chatter "" $ goog buying $ twtr not bad idea "" $ fb $ aapl $ baba $ socl
   - Again, mentions goog and possibly twtr.

8. "" rt AT_USER google advisory group recommends limiting "" right to be forgotten "" ruling only to eu URL $ goog
   - Focus on Google.

9. "" great free tutorial here for traders URL $ nflx $ bac $ amzn $ msft $ aapl $ goog $ googl $ feye URL""
   - Includes several unrelated stocks, including Google.

So, from the list, there are multiple tweets referencing different companies related to Google and Apple. The first tweet is about XLE, which I'm not sure if it relates directly to a stock unless it's part of a company name. TwTR is definitely part of a company with a ticker symbol (e.g., TWTR).goog and twtr are both involved in discussions here.

Considering that each relevant tweet mentions goog or twtr, but without specific company names, it's hard to pinpoint an exact stock. However, since there are multiple tweets about Google, especially the ones mentioning goog or twtr, this could imply a general sentiment towards the tech industry, which is often volatile and subject to market movements.

Looking at the other tweets: some mention deals with other companies (like TwTR), others discuss news related to specific companies like Apple. The overall tone seems to be positive because of the broader context around technology and companies in that sector. Each tweet supports a favorable outlook on Google, suggesting investors are optimistic about its performance.

Therefore, considering multiple positive tweets and general trends in the tech industry, I would conclude that the stock is likely [Positive]."
2015-02-07,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me start by breaking down the process.

First, the user provided three tweets and asked me to analyze them based on whether they're positive, neutral, or negative in relation to the stock's future price. The output has to be one of those three tags: [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative].

Looking at the tweets:

1. ""rt AT_USER latest quarter sales , yoy growth : $twtr $479m 97 % $fb $3.9b 49 % $lnkd $643m 44 % $aapl $74.6b 30 % $amzn $29.3b 15 % $goog …""  
This tweet is about the company's recent sales performance and financials. The user mentions ""last quarter sales, yoy growth"" which suggests positive information because it's a forward-looking metric. However, the numbers are all high and increasing, like 479m, 3.9b, etc. But I'm not sure if that directly indicates sentiment on the stock. Maybe some investors might see strong financials as good news.

2. ""this guy turned $100 into over $10,000 in just 30 days ! URL ... $dpm $frak $goog""  
This one is a bit confusing. The user mentions turning $100 into $10,000 in 30 days, which sounds like they made extra money quickly. The mention of ""frak"" might be a typo or slang for something else, but the key part is the growth from $100 to over $10,000. This seems like a positive sign because it's showing a significant increase, possibly boosting investor confidence.

3. ""these are the worst things about working at google $goog URL by AT_USER""  
This tweet suggests that the user has had some negative experiences with Google. The mention of ""the worst things"" indicates dissatisfaction or a bad experience. Investors usually react negatively to work environment issues because it can affect their decision to invest in the company.

Now, combining these thoughts: The first tweet is about financials which might be neutral if not enough context is given. The second tweet shows a positive outcome, reinforcing that sentiment. The third tweet flips the script by making investors realize there are bad things at Google, which could hurt their stock price.

But I'm still a bit unsure about the first tweet. It's all numbers without context. Maybe some people will see this as an opportunity, others as just another metric. The strong numbers and positive growth could be seen positively, but without knowing how the company is performing overall, it's hard to say for sure.

Looking at each tweet individually: the second one definitely has a positive impact because of the money-making aspect. The third clearly points out negative work environment issues which are bad news. The first tweet might have mixed emotions but not enough information to decide definitively. Since there is both positive and negative indication, maybe the overall sentiment isn't clear.

Wait, but the user provided just three tweets without more context about the company. So it's challenging. Maybe the second tweet is a standalone positive tip that could be relevant, while the third directly mentions a problem with work at Google, which would definitely make investors doubt the stock.

But I have to pick one tag based on these tweets. The second tweet seems like a direct tip that could boost confidence, but the third clearly says there are issues. So overall, is it positive or negative? It's more about whether people take the tip seriously versus seeing work issues as bad news.

I'm leaning towards [Negative] because while the financials might be positive, the work environment is a red flag for investors who think they'll invest in this company."
2015-02-08,Neutral,"Alright, so I'm looking at these tweets and trying to figure out their impact on the stock price of some company. Let me break it down step by step.

First, from the problem description, I need to identify the target stock symbol in each tweet because that's crucial for determining which stock we're analyzing. Then, for each tweet, I have to separate positive and negative factors, evaluate the sentiment, and finally sum up the overall sentiment as either Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

Looking at the first tweet: ""goog 10 minute opening range breakout - day trading strategies URL $ goog $ googl"". Hmm, this seems like a typo. The words are missing some letters. Maybe it's supposed to be ""goog 10-minute opening range breakout... googl""? So that would refer to Google (GOOG). Now, the tweet mentions the 10-minute range breaking, which could relate to stock price trends, especially in day trading strategies. Positive factors here might include increased confidence or support from selling signals.

Second tweet: ""logging in now to live stock chat URL $ goog $ aapl $ fb $ ebay options stocks daytrading URL"". This one is more about actions related to accessing the live chat and checking options stocks. It's less clear on specific factors, but if someone is logging into a stock chat for trading or analyzing options, that could indicate positive sentiment regarding market availability or interest in trading.

Third tweet: ""$ unh company info updated saturday , february 7 , 2015 7:59 : 25 pm $ pg $ f $ cube $ goog URL"". This seems to be a typo with ""unh"" as the company name. The date is Saturday, February 7, 2015, and time is 7:59:25 PM. The tweet updates company info for PG, Fontaine, Cube, and Google. This could relate to any of these companies' stock performance. If they're releasing information about their financials or market position, it might indicate positive or negative factors depending on the context.

Putting it all together, I think each tweet is providing different pieces of information about various companies. The first tweet focuses on Google's 10-minute range, which could show investor confidence. The second updates a stock chat, indicating interest in trading. The third provides company-specific info that might affect other stocks or sectors.

Since each tweet gives specific details about individual companies and their performance, it seems like they're not aggregating trends but rather providing information on different aspects of stock activity. Therefore, the impact is more about detailed market updates than overall stock price changes."
2015-02-09,Negative,"Okay, so I have to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a given company. The user provided four tweets and wants me to conclude whether each is [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, let's look at each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions free video tutorials related to trading, focusing on various stocks like TLT, TNA, QQQ, SPY, GPRO, GOOG, and AALP. Since it talks about potential strategies in the tech sector and investing trends, it's more about information dissemination rather than predicting market performance. So, this seems neutral.

2. The second tweet talks about $ sale deals being bought out by $ goog or another giant company. This sounds like a positive signal because if companies are selling off shares to larger players, they might be signaling that their stock is undervalued and could rise in price. That's probably a positive impact on the stock.

3. The third tweet from Canaccord estimates that Apple (AAPL) took 93% of smartphone profits globally, but it also mentions iPhone outselling all Samsung phones and Google losing the premium market. This is quite negative because Apple's profit margins are significant, which could indicate growth or concern about competition. Apple has a strong market share in tech, so this might be seen as a bearish indicator that stock prices could drop.

4. The fourth tweet mentions Bahaad shut down their channel and lacks a license for anti-terror standards, citing $ AALP and $ GCLN. This seems unrelated to the company's financial performance or industry trends. It’s more about consumer issues but not directly affecting the stock price of Apple or Google.

Now, combining these thoughts: The first is neutral, the second positive, third negative, and the fourth irrelevant. Overall, it looks like there are both positive and negative signals. But the most significant negative is from Canaccord's predictions which could lead to a sell-off for Apple. However, if other factors are balanced out, maybe it's not that drastic.

I think overall, the negative sentiment seems dominant because of Canaccord's data on Apple. The positive about Bahaad might be minor and less impactful. So, I'll conclude with [Negative]."
2015-02-10,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of Aapl. Let me break down each tweet step by step.

1. **First Tweet**: It mentions $ goog and mentions the market cap but doesn't provide any positive or negative information. It seems like it's just stating facts without sentiment.
   
2. **Second Tweet**: Talks about $ goog being updated on February 10, 2015, which is around March 8 this year. Also includes some other stock prices and URLs. The date and mention of updates might indicate potential future changes in the company's performance or valuation.

3. **Third Tweet**: Indicates that a user wants to position open positions in several stocks like Intercal, T-Gold, and others before $ aapl is updated. This suggests a strategic move but doesn't explicitly state if it's positive or negative for Aapl.

4. **Fourth Tweet**: The tweet says Google has $ 59 billion cash pile and mentions advertising money. Positive information about potential growth potential could be a sign that the stock might rise.

5. **Fifth Tweet**: Shares details from the ge stock message board updated on February 10, 2015. Similar to other updates, this might indicate that Google's performance is being monitored or analyzed by others.

6. **Sixth Tweet**: Discusses $ goog being up-to-date on company activities. This could mean that some investors are following the company closely and may update their sentiment based on that information.

Now, considering each tweet: The fourth one mentions $ 59 billion in cash, which is a positive number suggesting growth potential. However, all tweets don't provide specific predictions or confirmations but instead talk about current state of Google's operations, stock prices, and updates. So, while there's some positive info, it's speculative and not concrete evidence for a stock move.

Therefore, the overall sentiment doesn't show a clear positive impact because no tweet provides actionable information on Aapl's performance. They're just providing context about Google's financials and investor activity, which could be related but isn't sufficient to conclude a stock move."
2015-02-11,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this analysis problem step by step. So, I have these tweets about a company, and I need to determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative in their impact on the stock price.

First, the user provided a set of tweets with links to various stocks. My task is to go through each tweet and assess them one by one. Each tweet seems to be discussing different stocks: $msft, $googl, $aapl, $bbry, etc., which are all tech companies like Google, Apple, Samsung, etc.

Looking at the tweets:

1. ""any dd - updated collection of recent articles with the most recent articles first : $ msft $ goog $ dell URL"" – This seems to be about news about the company, possibly in general. It doesn't mention any specific stock or product details, so it's probably neutral because it's just an update.

2. ""nice recovery in $ lock this morning . congrats to those who caught the bottom URL $ goog $ baba $ twtr $ fb"" – This is a bit vague with some links and emojis, but mentions the company's recent progress towards recovery or recognition. It sounds like positive news since it's focusing on their progress and maybe some recognition, which could encourage investors.

3. ""rt AT_USER nice recovery in $ lock this morning . congrats to those who caught the bottom URL $ goog $ baba $ twtr $ …"" – Similar to tweet 2, it continues talking about recovery and mentions others, so positive sentiment.

4. ""rt AT_USER apple $ aapl is now bigger than google $ goog , samsung $ ssnlf , blackberry $ bbry , sony $ sne and broadcom $ brcm combined http ..."" – This one has specific numbers comparing Apple's size with other companies. It seems like an update on their market dominance or product launches, which can be positive if it gives confidence to investors.

5. ""AT_USER on $ twtr "" digested earnings gain ... this stock ain't done going up "" AT_USER $ goog"" – This tweet is about the stock performance of Twilio, mentioning that they've already made progress but not yet seen gains. It's speculative and doesn't give a clear trend, so it might be neutral or mixed.

6. ""rt $ tsla algos triggered sell in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 09:29 p / t 205.00 quant $ goog $ baba $ fb $ nflx $ bidu $ gpro $ akam $ qqq hft"" – This seems to be a stock analysis tweet from Tesla, discussing their stock performance and suggesting that other stocks may sell off because of something they triggered. This is usually seen as negative news as it can indicate a downward trend.

7. ""rt AT_USER hey you ... $ goog is offering an extra 2gb of drive storage if you do a security checkup on your account before 2/17 . them ..."" – A promise or offer to reward users by adding drive storage, which could be seen as positive because it's a benefit to the user and might encourage adoption.

8. "" chinese workers manipulate app store rankings - $ aapl $ goog must see pic URL"" – This tweet is about corporate actions affecting stock performance, specifically mentioning Chinese workers potentially manipulating app stores. While this can influence market sentiment, especially if it's a positive or negative impact on consumer behavior, it's speculative and not specific enough to confidently assess as positive, neutral, or negative.

9. ""$ goog $ aapl $ fb $ spy rd holland joined the group winning trades log URL"" – This seems to be a company announcement about joining a trading group that has won some trades. If they're part of a network or support group, it might indicate improved efficiency or better platform coverage, which could be positive.

10. "". AT_USER … same applies to $ goog $ twtr etc : • never install mobile apps • never upload your contacts • thwart tracking / cc : AT_USER donottrack"" – This is a common stock analysis tweet from a user pointing out that users shouldn't install apps or upload contacts, which can be seen as negative because it's encouraging users to do the opposite and reduce their impact on the market.

11. ""rt AT_USER apple $ aapl is now bigger than google $ goog , samsung $ ssnlf , blackberry $ bbry , sony $ sne and broadcom $ brcm combined http ..."" – Similar to tweet 4, it's comparing Apple's dominance with others but not giving specific details about the stock itself. This could be positive if it highlights gains or context.

12. ""helpful video for stock options beginners ! ! URL $ goog $ aapl $ googl $ amzn $ fb $ feye $ fxcm URL"" – A call to action, offering free resources on YouTube for learning about stock options. This is more promotional than informative and could be considered positive by encouraging investors to seek additional information.

13. ""rt AT_USER google rallies to near top of trading range week +1.2 % ytd +1.8 % below 100d & 200d avgs $ googl $ goog $ qqq $ xlk URL"" – This is an update on Google's performance, mentioning percentage changes and the stock being near a high. It shows improvement, which can be positive.

14. ""rt AT_USER the $ goog looks ready for flight"" – A statement that suggests Google might be taking a strategic step, possibly preparing to increase its market share. This could indicate confidence in its growth potential, making it positive.

Now, I need to summarize each tweet and determine their sentiment toward the stock price:

1. General update: Neutral
2. Positive news about progress: Positive
3. Similar to 2: Positive
4. Market dominance comparison: Positive
5. Speculative on performance: Neutral (maybe)
6. Stock performance analysis: Negative (due to speculation)
7. Promotional offer: Positive (encouraging adoption)
8. Corporate actions: Speculative, but could be negative if it negatively impacts the company.
9. Trading group update: Positive (better platform support)
10. User caution: Negative
11. Market dominance comparison: Positive
12. Educational video: Positive (encourages learning)
13. Stock performance: Positive
14. Strategic decision: Positive

Now, counting the positive tweets would be higher than the others. The negative tweet is 6 and 10.

So overall sentiment seems positive because there are more positive tweets and one negative but with a warning."
2015-02-12,Positive,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative in terms of their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me start by going through each tweet one by one and analyze them step by step.

First, the target stock is identified from the tweets. But looking at the tweets provided, I don't see any explicit mentions of a specific stock symbol. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe it's implied or maybe there are some hidden elements in the content. Since I can't extract the stock symbol directly, perhaps the sentiment analysis will be more about general trends related to tech companies as seen from these tweets.

Now, let's go through each tweet:

1. ""what AT_USER & others don't realize is that $ msft finally got into the game with their nok phone purchase & w / $ goog will eat at $ appl""

This seems like a positive statement about competitors getting involved. It mentions both Microsoft and Google increasing their prices, which could be a sign of positive trends in tech stocks.

2. ""rt AT_USER tweets have been indexed by $ goog before , but now , a tweet from AT_USER appears first in his news results . $ twtr URL""

This tweet is about the order of Twitter results. It seems to discuss some general trend, possibly related to stock prices on Twitter. Maybe it's suggesting that positive tweets come first, which might influence market sentiment.

3. ""this week , URL members have traded : $ fb , $ goog , $ juno , $ msft , $ ssys and many more . join us at URL""

This tweet is about trading activities on a website named URL. It mentions multiple stocks being traded. This could indicate increased activity in tech sectors, which might suggest positive sentiment towards these stocks.

4. ""rt AT_USER android shipments drop for the first time URL $ goog URL""

The tweet talks about Android shipments dropping and mentions Google. It's possible that if a stock is involved in certain hardware or software development, a decrease in production could affect the price. But it's not clear enough to determine a strong sentiment.

5. ""our penny stock picks gained over 205 % in 3 days ! special update : URL $ erbb $ bbda $ goog""

This tweet seems positive about the performance of certain penny stocks, which are smaller companies. It's showing increased profits and potential gains, so this could be a sign that these stocks are performing well.

6. ""rt AT_USER when you're ready to make winning stock options trades , come see us . $ goog URL URL""

Again, similar to previous tweets, it's discussing trading strategies on Google. This could mean that investors are looking for opportunities in tech stocks, which might lead to positive sentiment.

7-15: All these tweets mention Google and other tech companies, especially mentioning their stock prices or trends. They talk about trade activities, stock options, and hacking teams (though the context is about tech companies). These can indicate general movements in tech stocks, which would be a strong indicator of positive or negative sentiment.

Given that several tweets are discussing Google's performance, API usage, and stock options trading strategies, it suggests that these companies are performing well. The increasing activity on different platforms could mean more investors are watching, leading to potential positive price movements.

However, since the information is all about trends and movements in tech stocks, which can vary widely depending on economic conditions, sector-specific performance, etc., it's hard to say definitively whether this is a significant push for a stock or just general market movement. But considering that the tweets are positive or discussing current trends rather than negative news, they might be contributing positively.

But since some tweet content could lead to speculation (like stock options trading) and others just talking about tech companies doing well, it's challenging. However, given that several are discussing Google which is a major tech company, and mentions of API usage and trends, this suggests a positive environment for tech stocks in general.

So overall, these tweets are providing information about current trends in tech stocks (like increasing trade activity, Android shipments, stock gains), which can be seen as positive indicators. However, without knowing the specific context or broader market conditions, it's tricky to say if they're reinforcing a positive trend or just presenting data that could lead investors to react positively.

But considering that several tweets are about Google specifically and tech trends in general, I think these tweets collectively suggest that tech stocks might be performing well. So, leaning towards a positive sentiment."
2015-02-13,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company based on their given symbols and content. Let me start by breaking down each tweet.

First, I should identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at them:

1. The first tweet has mentions ofgoog (Google), aapl (Apple), vix (VIX index), and other stocks. Hmm, this is confusing because it refers to multiple stocks. Maybe all these are part of a larger context or just random links? I might need to pick the most prominent one, but since there are multiple, maybe each tweet affects different stocks. Wait, perhaps they're all related to Google-related stocks. Let me check.

2. The second tweet is about ""rt AT_USER when i see news like this , i do opposite . i'd buy $ goog before i'd sell . “ $ goog time at top may be nearing end URL."" This seems more focused on a user's opinion and trading strategy, talking about buying when the price is low and selling when it's high. It suggests a strategy that could have significant impact.

3. The third tweet mentions goog (Google) with details like last updated date, stock symbol (goog), total volume, etc. So again, Google.

4. The fourth tweet has multiple symbols: tuesday, february 17; pcln (Prudential Life Insurance Company); k (maybe an acronym for something else). Again, multiple stocks, but focusing on the first one about tuesday and February 17th, with a mention of pcln.

Wait, maybe I should assume that each tweet is about different stocks or perhaps some are typos. But given the content, it's more likely that they're all related to Google. Let me focus on the main point here.

Now, analyzing each tweet:

1. The first tweet has links and an URL indicating multiple stock symbols: goog, aapl, vix, etc. It seems like a random link without context about which stock to trade. Maybe it's not relevant enough for assessing the stock price impact.

2. The second tweet is about trading behavior based on news. The user is suggesting that when they see ""this"" type of news, if they notice "" goog time at top may be nearing end,"" they would buy or sell accordingly. It seems like a strategy suggesting to hold stocks when prices are high and sell when low. This could potentially influence investor sentiment positively.

3. The third tweet mentions Google's stock price (goog) with details about its last update, total volume. It doesn't contain any trading advice but just information about the stock. Without specific words or keywords indicating a trade action, it's hard to assess impact on the price unless there are direct mentions of trades.

4. The fourth tweet is about February 17th, 2023, with mentions of tuesday and pcln. Again, multiple stocks but focusing on tuesday as part of the date. No trading advice here either.

Considering these, the second tweet seems to be a strategic instruction based on market sentiment, which could positively influence investor behavior. The other tweets are more random links or unrelated, so they likely have minimal impact on the stock price.

Therefore, given that the second tweet suggests a strategy that could lead to buying when prices are low and selling when high, it might create positive sentiment for the company, potentially increasing the stock's value."
2015-02-14,Positive,"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I have to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on a company's stock price and then decide whether it's positive, neutral, or negative.

First, I need to figure out what the target stock is. The first tweet mentions ""aapl,"" which is Apple Inc.'s ticker symbol. Then there are other mentions like $ goog, which should be Google's stock. So, the target stock here seems to be Apple (AAPL) because it's explicitly mentioned and others might refer to their respective stocks.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one. 

1. The first tweet says, ""rt AT_USER apple $ aapl is now bigger than google $ goog , samsung $ ssnlf , blackberry $ bbry , sony $ sne and broadcom $ brcm combined http …"" This seems to be encouraging Apple to increase their market capitalization by showing it's being compared against several other companies. It suggests that more attention or growth is expected from Apple relative to competitors. 

2. The second tweet reads, ""AT_USER $ goog your tweet has been featured on the newest market analytics app , market parse , for iphone . URL."" This seems to be a link request. The user is saying their tweet was featured in a new app and they'll provide more details about it. It doesn't seem directly related to Apple stock but rather about sharing content, which could potentially increase engagement or traffic.

3. The third tweet is ""rt AT_USER $ aapl > $ msft + $ goog + $ 12 billion."" This seems to be encouraging Apple by mentioning another company's performance (MSFT) and a financial figure ($12 billion), indicating that something significant has happened or is happening in the market that Apple is responding to.

4. The fourth tweet says, ""rt AT_USER the deal between twitter & google is done ! do your tweets right $ goog is watching , searching ... URL AT_USER."" This seems like an update on a new deal between Twitter and Google. It suggests that a significant collaboration or agreement has been reached, which might indicate increased market activity or investor interest in tech companies.

Now, I need to assess the sentiment of each tweet towards Apple's stock. 

1. The first tweet is encouraging others to consider Apple for more market capitalization by comparing it with other companies. This suggests that the overall environment is positive, and investors are likely to be optimistic about future growth or acquisition opportunities.

2. The second tweet is a link request, which isn't directly related to stock performance but could increase user engagement, potentially attracting more users who might be interested in stock research or analysis.

3. The third tweet is clearly encouraging Apple's success by mentioning other companies' performance and financial figures, implying that something positive has happened, leading to increased expectations of growth.

4. The fourth tweet talks about a new deal between Google and Twitter, which could lead to increased competition, collaboration, or market interest in both companies. This might affect stock prices if investors are investing more in tech firms.

Putting it all together: Each tweet is either encouraging Apple's growth indirectly through comparisons with competitors, financial figures, or announcing deals. There's a mix of positive and some less direct signals about potential growth areas. 

However, without specific information on past performance, earnings, or company-wise news, it's challenging to assign an exact sentiment. The first tweet is more direct in suggesting broader market trends, while the others touch on different aspects but are not as conclusive.

Considering all factors—positive comparisons and mentions of deals—it seems like the overall impact is positive for Apple. Investors might be looking ahead to growth opportunities or partnerships that could boost the stock price."
2015-02-15,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I have to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the tweets:

1. 100k challenge is on . are you in ? URL $ aapl $ tsla $ spy $ iwm $ fb $ pcln $ lnkd $ googl $ goog $ qqq $ dia $ iwm $ amzn $ nflx
2. if you want to trade like a pro , learn from the pros . URL is here to help . 14 - day trial available . $ hemp $ goog $ mnkd
3. $ goog recent news updated sunday , february 15 , 2015 06:59 : 22 am $ fitx $ pjp $ twtr $ vdsi URL

Hmm, the first tweet is a list of stock symbols but doesn't specify which one. The second and third tweets are just URLs with some text in them.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me look again. Oh, wait, no, the first tweet has several stock symbols: APlp, TSLA, SPY, etc., then some numbers like 100k challenge and a question mark. Maybe it's about a specific company, but not clear.

The second tweet mentions trading tips, a URL that helps people help each other with trades, and a 14-day trial for a product (goog). The third tweet is another URL linking to news on February 15, 2015.

Wait, I think the first tweet might be about a stock symbol or something else. But it's not clear which company to focus on because there are multiple symbols listed. Maybe the user made an error and intended to list one specific stock? Or maybe it's a bit confusing.

The second and third tweets seem more like marketing messages, encouraging people to learn from pros and share their trading tips. They might be promoting a service or product but don't provide any financial data or analysis.

Since I can't identify the target stock from the first tweet accurately, I'm unsure how much impact it has on any company's stock price. The second and third tweets are more about user-generated content related to trading, which doesn't directly relate to the stock performance of a particular company.

In that case, perhaps the first tweet is either irrelevant or misinterpreted, so its impact might be neutral, but I'm not entirely sure. Without knowing the specific stock or context behind the first tweet, it's hard to assess whether it has a positive, negative, or neutral effect on any company."
2015-02-16,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the future stock price of a company. Let's see what each tweet says.

First, there are five tweets provided. The user wants me to extract the target stock symbol and then assess each tweet. Each tweet is about different stocks and their related topics.

Starting with the first tweet: It mentions something about $ goog max pain being 520.00 for maturity on February 20, 2015, at a price of $549.01. The URL links seem like they might be going to specific stock pages or related sites. So I don't think this is directly affecting any specific stock.

Next, the second tweet talks about a live stock chat with several stock symbols: $ goog, $ pcln, etc., and mentions $ twtr, $ fb, $ aapl, $ gm, $ dust, $ baba. Again, these are broad mentions of different stocks or companies. No clear target here.

The third tweet is about AT_USER's reaction regarding $ aapl & $ goog investors not supporting ads. It mentions a missed opportunity. This seems like customer feedback or investor response. If the investors aren't taking ads seriously, maybe this could reduce user engagement on the company's platform. That might negatively impact their stock price.

The fourth tweet promotes investing via AT_USER with references to $ goog and $ googl (which is Alphabet) and $ spy. It says ""intelligent investing is (literally) child's play"" and suggests seeking alpha through their services. This looks more positive, encouraging investors in the company to engage more actively.

Fifth tweet mentionsSandisk getting dumped by one's biggest client. The URL links specific to financial times, so it seems related toSandisk stock or an analysis of their performance. If there was a significant drop, this could be negative for their stock.

So now I need to assess each tweet individually.

1. First tweet: No target mentioned, doesn't affect the stock.
2. Second tweet: Broad stock mentions without specific stock.
3. Third tweet: Feedback from investors not taking ads seriously, which might decrease user interest.
4. Fourth tweet: Promoting investing with a positive tone, encouraging others to invest in the company.
5. Fifth tweet: Sandisk's performance being impacted by their client, possibly negative impact on their stock.

Now, combining these assessments. The third tweet is about investors' response and could reduce engagement but doesn't directly mention specific stocks. Fourth tweet is promoting investment via a positive method, which would encourage more investments in the company. Fifth tweet mentions Sandisk getting dumped, which might lower their performance.

But since I need to determine overall impact on future stock price, it's probably more about each tweet talking about different aspects of the company. The third tweet isn't a direct target but affects customer engagement. Fourth and fifth tweets are promoting investment via a positive platform.

So combining these, while there might be some negative news (Sandisk performance), the fourth tweet is encouraging investors positively. But overall sentiment based on broad statements might lean towards [Neutral], as it's a mix of different trends without clear positives or negatives."
2015-02-17,Neutral,"Alright, I need to determine the likely impact of these tweets on the stock price of TSLA ( tesla ) by analyzing each tweet individually and then combining the results.

First, let's identify the target stock symbol. It appears in some tweets but not all. For example, tweet 1 mentions $ tsla, while others include $ goog, $ aapl, etc. Since TSLA is one of the stocks listed (tesla), that's our focus here.

Now, I'll go through each tweet one by one to break them down into factors and assess sentiment.

1. "" absolutely , just as $ tsla and $ goog have shown . rt AT_USER you think $ aapl can be disruptive in the auto industry ?"" 
   - This seems neutral because it's making an opinion on whether APL will disrupt Auto Industry. Not sure if this is positive or negative, more of an opinionated comment.

2. "" monitor your watchlist of assets for tweets - us tech giants URL $ aapl $ goog $ googl $ yhoo URL via AT_USER""
   - This tweet suggests that the user monitors a list of tech companies, including APL and GOG (which is Google). It might be neutral or slightly positive if they think monitoring is helpful.

3. "" google needs to deliver in 2015 - google inc . $ goog $ googl $ yhoo URL via AT_USER""
   - This looks like a statement about Google's plan for 2015. It could be positive if it expects growth, or neutral if it's seen as a negative outlook.

4. "" toptickertweets $ aapl $ dax $ ibio $ spy $ usd $ agrx $ tsla $ goog $ vdsi $ twtr sentiquant 2015021 7 08:00 : 33:896""
   - This is an investment tip. Sentiment here might be positive if it's seen as helpful or neutral if just a suggestion.

5. "" rt AT_USER grexit looks like $ googl $ goog has it all figured out about greece URL""
   - The user is talking about the Greek debt crisis and Google addressing it. This could be considered negative because it affects the economy, which is relevant to tech companies.

6. "" follow me into live stock chat ! $ goog $ pcln $ twtr $ fb $ aapl $ ebay $ gm $ dust $ baba URL URL""
   - Promoting GOM (Google's stock) and other tech stocks via live chat. This seems neutral as it doesn't express sentiment.

7. "" google may not be evil , but is it democratic ? founders reduce equity stake , but not control URL $ goog google $ googl""
   - Discussing Google's leadership structure. If the user thinks Google isn't good, this could be negative. But it might also depend on broader views.

8. "" rt AT_USER interesting thoughts on microsoft via AT_USER $ msft $ twtr $ goog URL URL""
   - Making a comment about Microsoft. It seems neutral as it's just talking about something else.

9. "" optionstraining video : payoff diagrams URL $ goog $ googl $ tsls $ tqqq $ xlv $ xnrg $ nke $ dia URL""
   - Discussing options trading and payoff diagrams for Google. This could be positive if it's seen as beneficial or neutral if just speculative.

10. ""$ t $ goog : cisco , sk telecom jump aboard on.lab ' s sdn initiative : URL""
    - The user is talking about a company called LAB discussing a Sdn (Subsidiary) initiative with Cisco and Sk Telecom. This seems neutral as it's more of an update than opinion.

Now, compiling the factors from each tweet:

Positive factors: 3,5,9

Neutral factors: 1,6,7,8,10

Negative factors: 2,4,10 (though tweet 10 is about tech companies, not necessarily negative.)

Assuming that overall sentiment is influenced by positive and neutral tweets. Neutral tweets don't significantly sway the opinion. Positive tweets lean towards a possible decline or improvement, but since it's only one stock, it might be seen as speculative.

Given all these mixed factors, I think the overall sentiment leans towards a slight uncertainty. It doesn't have enough conclusive information to make a definitive prediction, especially considering tweet 5 about the Greek debt crisis which could impact other companies."
2015-02-18,Neutral,"Okay, so I have to figure out the impact on the stock price based on these tweets. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually and then combine their effects.

The first tweet is about a person catching a winner in live chat. That sounds like positive because it's exciting and might attract investors. So that's a positive sign.

Next, the second tweet says that $ goog is heading back to the lows of 543 soon and losing steam. Losing steam would mean the stock might drop, which could be negative. But I'm not sure if it's enough to outweigh other factors.

The third tweet mentions something about AT_USER setting sights on India with $ goog URL. It seems like a marketing strategy or potential news related to the company. That could positively influence investor confidence and stock price.

The fourth tweet is a bit confusing because of some abbreviations like ""data dependent"" which doesn't make much sense. I'll need to see if that's related to the stock performance, but it's unclear, so maybe it's more about the company's performance rather than the tweets themselves.

Now, putting this together: positive from the first tweet, negative due to goog losing steam in the second, and neutral or possibly positive from the third tweet. It seems like there are mixed signals here—some positives, some negatives. I think overall sentiment might be leaning towards a mix of positive and negative factors but with some uncertainty about the impact on the stock price."
2015-02-19,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative impact on the stock price of a company. The target stock symbol is 'goog', which is Google Inc., based on the URLs provided.

First, let me go through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet says, ""Google inc ( nasdaq : goog ) enters the era of launching balloon ... : URL."" Hmm, this seems like a promotional or hype statement about Google launching something called a ""balloon,"" which doesn't seem related to any company. It looks like it's just using 'goog' and adding some text in quotes. I don't think this is relevant because there's no mention of a new product or service from Google that could impact the stock price.

2. The second tweet mentions multiple companies: long watchlist, expe, goog, srpt, mdt, etc., along with some URLs. This seems like a list of investments or possibly a personal story where someone is holding a 'long' watchlist. However, without specific information about how these companies relate to Google's operations or if they're related to the stock being analyzed, it's hard to assess the impact on 'goog' directly.

3. The third tweet says, ""Google inc to launch paid youtube subscription service for $10 a month : google inc to launch paid youtu ... URL."" Similar to the first tweet, this is another promotional statement about Google launching a paid YouTube subscription service. Again, it's a hype campaign with no indication of any product development or actual business impact related to 'goog' itself.

Putting all these together, none of the tweets are discussing any specific aspect of Google that could affect its stock price. They're more about potential announcements or promotional campaigns without actionable information. Since there's no mention of positive news regarding revenue, profit, earnings, etc., nor negative statements against competitors, it seems like this is neutral.

I should also consider the context. While some tweets mention ""long watchlist,"" which could imply investor sentiment towards Google, but without knowing if those stocks are related to 'goog' or if there's any actual information about Google's performance, I can't say for sure. Additionally, the use of promotional URLs suggests that these are unrelated products, so they don't have a direct impact on Google's stock.

Therefore, after evaluating all tweets, it seems like none of them provide clear or actionable information that would influence the stock price positively, neutrally, or negatively. So, my conclusion is [Neutral]."
2015-02-20,Positive,"Okay, so I have to figure out the impact of these three tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me take it step by step.

First, I need to extract the stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the first one: ""goog URL e . l . james should not be penning the ' 50 shades ' sequel URL"". Hmm, that's a bit vague. Maybe it refers to Google? The word ""goog"" is a common abbreviation for Google, so I'll assume the stock symbol is GOO. But wait, sometimes people misspell their abbreviations. Let me check: GOOG is definitely Google, and GOO is also a typo. Since they mention penning a sequel URL, maybe it's about the next Google product? Not sure yet.

The second tweet says: ""the stock picking service of 2014 watch this ! here URL .. $ amzn $ mcox $ goog"". Again, ""amzn"" and ""mcox"" don't ring a bell. Maybe they're referring to Amazon or some other company with those names? I'm not sure about that. It seems like the stock symbols are AMZN and MCOX.

The third tweet is: ""$ bbry $ goog $ msft $ googl $ aapl"". Again, ""bbry"" doesn't look familiar. Maybe it's a typo or referring to something else entirely. ""M sft"" could be Microsoft? ""GOOL"" is Google again, and ""AAPL"" is Apple. So maybe the stock symbols here are GOO (Google), MSFT (Microsoft), and AAPL (Apple).

Wait, but in the first tweet, they're using ""goog URL e . l . james..."" which might refer to a specific product or feature. But since I can't get a clear symbol from that, perhaps it's better to focus on the ones we can identify: AMZN, GOO, MSFT, and AAPL.

Now, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. Then assess sentiment towards investor confidence.

First tweet about Google's sequel URL might be more of a promotional tweet or something that could boost investor interest in Google, which would probably be a positive factor.

Second tweet mentions Amazon, MSFT, and GOO. These are all established companies. If they're going for a stock pick service, maybe there's an investment opportunity, which is usually positive for the company.

Third tweet has Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). Both have strong fundamentals, especially since the tech industry is growing. This could be a sign of good growth potential, so that would add to the positive sentiment.

Putting it all together: Google's URL tweet likely adds interest in Google. Amazon and others involved are strong, showing growth. Apple and Microsoft are stable but growing. So overall, these tweets seem supportive of the stock market's positive trend."
2015-02-21,Negative,"Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided two tweets and wants to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. I need to figure out how each tweet affects the stock.

First, looking at the target stock symbol from the tweets: $TSLA. So the company in question is Tesla, Inc., or the tech giant associated with it.

The first tweet is ""rt AT_USER $ tsla , $ lnkd , $ goog : thank you , see you next cycle - URL"". This looks like a link to Tesla's website from Lawrence's page. Since the target stock symbol is TSLA and this seems to be an internal message requesting a meeting with the CEO, it doesn't directly mention anything about the stock price or its performance.

Now, for the second tweet: ""lawrence page chief executive officer sells $ 18,090 , 684 worth of $ goog google inc . - form 4 insidertrading - URL"". This clearly mentions that the CEO sold a significant amount of Google shares. Selling shares is a big deal because it can lead to negative sentiment among investors. Insider trading can be a red flag for stock price changes, potentially causing a sell-off or decline.

So, putting this together, while the first tweet doesn't mention Tesla's performance, indicating no direct effect on the stock, the second tweet shows insider selling which typically triggers concerns about the company's financial health and investor sentiment. That should have a negative impact."
2015-02-22,Missing,File not found
2015-02-23,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user provided three tweets and asked me to analyze them for their impact on stock price trends. They also specified an output format that's quite specific: I need to conclude with one of ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"". 

First, looking at the target stock symbol. The only tweet mentions ""option millionaires"" which doesn't give a clear hint about the company. It's possible that this could refer to options trading, but without knowing more about the specific stock, it's hard to tell if it relates to tech companies like Apple, Google, or Microsoft.

Next, I need to analyze each tweet individually. Let's go through them one by one.

1. The first tweet talks about AT_USER and mentions decentralized blockchain technology and smart cars. It seems more related to tech trends and innovation rather than a specific company. The mention of ""smart cars will talk to each other"" suggests an ongoing development in their infrastructure or product line, which could imply growth but not necessarily a direct investment into a specific stock.

2. The second tweet is about option millionaires and mentions Google strikes mobile payments deals with U.S. carriers. This seems more about business moves within the tech industry rather than a stock that's directly related to it. It could be an internal move for company expansion or cost-cutting, but unless this relates to a specific stock, it's hard to assess its impact on the stock price.

3. The third tweet is more generic, talking about auto plans and mentions several companies like Adepte, Inc., Pfeiffer Products, Inc., and Microsoft Inc. It's unclear which of these could be related to a specific stock symbol, especially given that none are explicitly mentioned in the tweets. This makes it difficult to link to any particular company or stock.

Considering all three tweets together, none of them directly mention a specific stock. The first tweet is about blockchain tech, which could indicate potential growth areas but not an investment target. The second tweet is more about business strategies within tech. The third tweet is too generic and doesn't specify a company. 

Since the target stock isn't provided and there's no clear connection to any of the tweets as a whole or individual tweet, it's challenging to determine the impact on the stock price. Without specific context or indication of how these tweets relate to a particular stock or industry sector, I can only make an educated guess.

I think the best approach here is to present a neutral conclusion because without more information, it's impossible to assess the sentiment accurately. There might be growth potential, but unless there's specific evidence linking to a particular stock symbol, the impact is uncertain."
2015-02-24,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company and then determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, the user wants me to analyze the tweets for their likely effect on a specific stock. But they haven't provided the actual stock symbol yet. That could be an issue because without knowing which stock we're talking about, I can't make accurate assessments. However, since it's not specified in the query, maybe each tweet is related to different stocks? Or perhaps all tweets are from the same company?

Looking at the tweets, they mention terms like ""goog,"" ""qqq,"" ""ma,"" ""facebook,"" and stuff about stock symbols and ETFs. Maybe these tweets are all talking about different ETFs or stock picks for a particular company. But again, without knowing which one, I can't pinpoint it.

Wait, perhaps each tweet is about the same company but phrased differently? Let me check:

1. ""buy google stock invest in $ goog on etoro URL stocks""
2. ""$ goog $ spy $ qqq $ ma this weeks earnings trade - update from option millionaires | stock options chatroom | call op ... URL""
3. ""$ qqq $ goog google strikes mobile payments deal with big wireless carriers , buys softcard technology via AT_USER URL""
4. ""rt AT_USER "" mobile accounts for more than 50 % of AT_USER watch time and ~ 75 % of overall views . "" AT_USER mobile stats $ goog URL""
5. ""rt AT_USER google has officially unveiled a youtube app aimed at children : URL $ goog""
6. ""rt AT_USER google has officially introduced a youtube app aimed at children : URL $ goog""
7. ""$ fb $ goog $ googl : cantor fitzgerald's top 3 internet stock picks : URL""
8. ""rt AT_USER google has officially introduced a youtube app aimed at children : URL $ goog""

Hmm, it seems like multiple tweets are discussing Google's YouTube product, but each is about different points or features. Maybe all these tweets are from the same company, and they're talking about their new YouTube integration. So, perhaps the stock to analyze is related to Google's investment in a new YouTube app for mobile users.

But without knowing which specific stock (like GOOGL), it's hard to assess the impact on its price. Different stocks perform differently based on news. For example, if the company is expanding their services and increasing revenue, that could be positive or neutral depending on market sentiment and current trends.

Wait, but maybe all these tweets are about Google's broader stock? Or perhaps they're different ETFs like GOOG, FB, etc., which might represent different sectors or companies. If it's a mix of ETFs related to technology, this could indicate overall interest in tech, which might have a positive impact on the tech sector stocks.

But again, without knowing the specific company, I can't say for sure. Maybe each tweet is about a different stock from Google, like GOOGL, FB, etc., and their performance over time would show how Google's product updates affect their price.

Alternatively, perhaps these tweets are all part of a news feed or analysis section where users are discussing different aspects related to Google, which might influence the overall stock market, but again, it depends on other factors like economic indicators and company-specific news.

I think I need to consider that without the specific stock symbol or context, the analysis is incomplete. But maybe the user has more information in mind. Alternatively, perhaps each tweet is part of a list of positive or negative comments related to the same stock, but again, without knowing which one it is, I can't determine.

Since the user hasn't provided the stock symbol, and the output needs to be based on that, I'm stuck. Without that information, my analysis can't accurately conclude whether the impact is positive, neutral, or negative.

Wait a minute, maybe each tweet is about different stocks for the same company? Let me check:

Looking at tweets 3-8: They all mention ""goog,"" ""qqq,"" ""ma,"" and others. Maybe these are various ETFs like GOOGL, QQQ, etc., which could represent different sectors or assets. If Google's portfolio is diversified with multiple ETFs, the overall impact on its price would depend on how each ETF performs relative to the market.

But again, without knowing which specific stock symbol we're dealing with, it's impossible to evaluate the sentiment based solely on these tweets. The user must have intended for this analysis, but perhaps I need to proceed with an assumption or note that more information is needed.

In conclusion, since each tweet refers to different ETFs related to Google and their product updates, without knowing which one we're focusing on, it's not possible to determine the stock's impact accurately. The sentiment could be influenced by factors like market trends, company performance relative to others in the portfolio, economic indicators, etc."
2015-02-25,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol mentioned is ""goog"", which is Alphabet Inc., known for its technology companies like Google. Now, reviewing each tweet:

1. The first tweet is about logging in and mentioning some stocks but doesn't provide specific information or analysis.
2. The next few tweets are all mentions of various tech stocks with a focus on the global economy's impact on the stock prices. They mention things like low-interest rates and market corrections. The sentiment seems neutral because they're discussing factors that could affect the stock, not specifically indicating good or bad.
3. The fifth tweet again is just another generic mention without any positive or negative cues.
4. The sixth tweet refers to Google's YouTube plans but doesn't provide a clear message about the stock itself.
5. The seventh tweet suggests Google should consider a ""sneaking"" investment, which could be seen as a speculative buying attempt.
6. The eighth tweet gives some numerical feedback on market share changes and growth potential, indicating investor interest but not sentiment towards the stock's performance.
7. The ninth tweet talks about selling 1000 shares, which is a transaction detail, not relevant to overall stock performance.
8. The tenth tweet mentions Google being featured by Apple on their market parse page, which could imply positive brand exposure or coverage, suggesting an upward trend.
9. The eleventh tweet also has the same information as the tenth, reinforcing positive brand awareness.

Putting it all together, most tweets are about factors that can influence investor sentiment without stating whether they're good or bad for the stock. However, the eleventh tweet does mention being featured on a market parse page, which is often seen as positive media coverage. This might indicate increased visibility and could lead to better trading opportunities, which in turn suggests a positive impact on the stock price."
2015-02-26,Neutral,"Alright, I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company based on them. The user has provided 20 tweets, so I'll go through each one step by step.

First, I should identify the target stock from each tweet. It looks like most tweets mention Google (GOOG), except for some that talk about Microsoft or Apple. Let me check each tweet:

1. $ goog - Microsoft closing two handset plants in China: This mentions Microsoft, so I'll focus on GOOG.
2. rt AT_USER google will begin allowing developers to pay to promote their apps in its play store: Focus on GOOG.
3. “ AT_USER youtube has more than one billion users each month . but it still isn't profitable : URL $ goog ” Neither is AT_USER: Not sure about this, maybe not related to Google.
4. with one billion users a month , youtube still doesn’t make money $ goog URL via AT_USER: Another unrelated tweet.
5. same as 4: Again, unrelated.
6. AT_USER your tweet about $ goog had a sentiment of 5 and was featured on market parse . URL
7. AT_USER $ goog your tweet has been featured on market parse , for iphone. URL
8. rt AT_USER with one billion users a month , youtube still doesn’t make money $ goog URL via AT_USER: Related to Google.
9. $ scty here an agreement with $ goog from 2011 : URL: This might be related, but not sure if it's about Google.
10. rt AT_USER google will begin allowing developers to pay to promote their apps in its play store : URL $ goog URL
11. top tickertweets includes $ goog, $ aapl, etc. So this is definitely about Google.

13. buy google stock invest in $ goog on etoro URL stocks: Focus on GOOG.
14. same as 8 and 10: Related to Google.
15. same as 14,16: Related to Google.
17-19: Same as 8,12, etc.: Related to Google.

Now that I have the target stock identified, I need to analyze each tweet's factors and sentiment. The key factors are positive (e.g., sales growth) or negative (e.g., profitability) from YouTube's perspective, which might indirectly affect Google if there's a correlation. However, I should note that sometimes such tweets could be misleading or speculative.

Looking at the factors:

1. Microsoft: Positive.
2. Google's app promotion: Positive.
3. YouTube being profitable: Maybe not directly related to Google.
4. Other unrelated tweets.
5. More users but still profitable: Not helpful for Google.
6. Sentiment of 5? Not sure what that means, maybe positive or negative.
7. Related to Google and iPhone, so yes, likely relevant.
8. YouTube profit: Not directly about Google's stock.
9. 2011 agreement: Maybe not related.
10. Google promotion: Yes, likely.
11-13,14,16,17-19: Definitely related to Google.

Now, sentiment analysis:

For tweet 6, the sentiment of 5 might mean a strong positive or negative opinion. Not enough info to determine, so I can't assess it as positive or negative here.
Tweets 7 and 10 mention Google's promotion, which is good for investors. Also, tweet 11 mentions Google and Apple, so that's also relevant.

Negative tweets: None that are clearly negative unless something contradicts a positive message.

Positive tweets could have both good and bad factors. For example, the one about YouTube's profitability (tweets 15) might show potential profit margins, which is positive but not directly Google's focus. The agreement in 9 may indicate strategic importance to investors, which is positive.

Neutral tweets: None seem neutral; all are either positive or negative with some relevance.

Putting it together, while there are mixed signals from YouTube's profitability and the company's promotion, the overall sentiment leans towards positive because the most relevant tweets are about Google promoting its services. The one about YouTube being profitable isn't directly about Google but could indicate potential growth areas."
2015-02-27,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out how to determine whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative in terms of their impact on the stock price of a given company, which is Google's (GOOGL) right now. The user provided a list of 10 tweets and wants me to analyze them step by step.

First, I should recall the process they mentioned: identifying the target stock symbol from the tweets and then doing a tweet-by-tweet analysis. For each tweet, I'll separate it into positive and negative factors, assess the sentiment, and then combine everything to give an overall sentiment.

Looking at the tweets, the target seems to be Google. Let me see if any of them have specific stocks mentioned. I notice that some mentions are of $ goog, $ googl, $ pcln, $ twtr, etc., which might refer to Google's shares. Others mention different companies or unrelated ones, but I'll focus on the relevant ones.

Now, let's take each tweet one by one:

1. "" shut up . ' with one billion users a month , youtube still doesn ’ t make money $ goog URL via AT_USER"" - This seems like a meta-comment or mockup. It doesn't directly mention Google but is unrelated to stock changes. So probably neutral.

2. ""$ goog oi for maturity 02/27 / 2015 . 550.00 highest put . 560.00 highest call . URL"" - This seems like a financial statement or announcement about Google's stock price. The ""highest put"" and ""highest call"" could indicate some news affecting the stock, so positive.

3. ""$ goog URL why the fcc's net neutrality vote may have just saved the startup ecosystem URL"" - Again, this is a meta-comment questioning an event that might affect Google's ecosystem. Unrelated to Google stock directly—neutral.

4. ""reverse en 100 largos de $ goog a 561.41 usd perdiendo - 5usd idop 171270 vía URL URL"" - This seems like a financial announcement, possibly about exchange rates or currency fluctuations affecting Google's USD exposure—could be positive.

5. ""rt AT_USER how apple lost $ 533 million to an 8th - grade dropout patent troll : URL $ aapl $ goog $ pcln $ k"" - Here, someone is commenting on Apple losing money to another company that seems like a joke or irrelevant. The loss doesn't impact Google's stock—neutral.

6. ""$ goog was nice today and has been running all week . URL"" - This seems like an unrelated statement about Google's performance over the past few days. It might not be news enough for sentiment change, so neutral.

7. ""i sold my $ goog and $ googl stocks today with a € 127 profit . i'm okay with this."" - This is an explicit financial transaction about selling shares with profit—positive sentiment towards selling stock—so positive.

8. ""rt AT_USER google now says it won ’ t ban bloggers over sexually explicit material in most cases : URL $ goog"" - A new announcement from Google about its policies, which could impact the company's reputation and thus its stock price—if it gets positive media coverage or news, it might be a positive signal.

9. ""buy google stock invest in $ goog on etoro URL stocks"" - This is an investment recommendation—people buying shares for growth—they have positive sentiment towards investing—but Google isn't necessarily known for tech stocks; they also sell financials. So maybe mixed but leaning towards positive.

10. ""my $ lnkd connections include . AT_USER . AT_USER . AT_USER AT_USER ... connect with me @ URL $ aapl $ goog"" - This is an ongoing interaction, likely in the social market or group discussions—neutral sentiment.

Now, summarizing the sentiments:

- 1: Neutral
- 2: Positive
- 3: Neutral
- 4: Positive
- 5: Neutral
- 6: Neutral
- 7: Positive
- 8: Mixed (some positive but tech stocks can be volatile)
- 9: Mixed (in general, tech stock isn't the top performer)
- 10: Neutral

Overall sentiment is a mix of positive and mixed. So, overall, it's probably [Neutral] because while there are some positive sentiments, others are neutral or slight negative."
2015-02-28,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let's break down each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at them, they all mention ""goog"" which is Alphabet Inc., so the stock in question must be GOOG, as it's the symbol for Google.

Now, going through each tweet:

1. ""check this $ goog URL"" – This seems like an attempt to check a URL, which doesn't provide specific information about the stock or its performance. It's more of a technical query.

2. ""$ goog URL social security q & a : when should we claim to maximize benefits for our disabled child ? URL"" – Again, this tweet is directing someone towards a social security question and seems to be making an inquiry rather than providing any financial data or analysis about GOOG. It doesn't offer any information relevant to stock performance.

3. ""$ goog $ aten $ dow homeowever URL."" – This one mentions ""atene"" which I believe stands for ATEN, not a known symbol related to Google. The mention of Dow could be confusing, but it's unclear what this tweet is aiming at. It doesn't provide any meaningful information about GOOG.

4. ""look into URL stocks $ jobs $ goog."" – This one suggests looking into GOOG as part of looking into the stock itself and its relationship with jobs. However, without specific data or analysis, it's not giving actionable insights about GOOG's performance.

5. ""goog year to date has changed +6.08 % percent . +7.67 % in the last 30 days . $ goog google inc class c full breakd url."" – This tweet provides two percentage changes over time: a positive 6.08% and another of 7.67%. It also mentions that GOOG is part of Google Inc., which is class C, and there's an action to ""full breakd url."" The term ""breakd"" might be a typo or miswritten.

Now, analyzing the sentiment from each tweet:

- Tweets 1 and 2 are technical queries about URLs, so they don't provide positive or negative information.
- Tweets 3 and 4 are more general inquiries but still lack specific financial data or analysis.
- Tweet 5 provides some percentage changes in GOOG's performance. While it mentions a positive change, the action ""full breakd url"" is unclear and could be a typo. However, the mention of Google Inc. being class C might indicate stockability if the company is stable.

Considering all these tweets don't provide actionable information about GOOG's financial health or any key factors that could influence its stock price. They're more about technical aspects rather than economic performance or management changes. Therefore, there's no clear positive, negative, or neutral sentiment from these tweets."
2015-03-01,Positive,"Alright, I'm looking at these tweets trying to figure out their impact on Google's stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. It seems like all tweets are about Google. So, the target is ""goog"" or something close.

Now, for each tweet, I have to separate positive and negative factors. Let's go through them one by one.

1. The first tweet says, ""rt AT_USER with one billion users a month , youtube still doesn’t make money $ goog URL via AT_USER."" Hmm, that looks like Google is selling itself on Twitter, but the tweet isn't directly related to stock performance. It might influence investor sentiment, maybe giving them more platforms to use, which could be positive or neutral.

2. The second tweet: ""$ goog - some companies are more wonderful than others URL."" This seems like it's comparing companies and their abilities, suggesting that Google is doing well relative to others. This might push investor confidence positively towards Google.

3. Third tweet: ""what's google doing in seoul , south korea ? $ goog $ googl URL via AT_USER."" This one mentions SEO, which relates to search engines and could affect online visibility. But since it's in a location context, it might not directly impact stock performance unless it affects the company's business operations.

4. Fourth tweet: ""copy trading . how to earn + 13 % in 1 month URL via AT_USER - $ study $ eurusd $ fb $ twtr $ lnkd $ goog makemoney."" This one talks about trading and earning 13% in a month, which is clearly positive news. It shows potential for growth and profit, so this tweet adds to investor confidence positively.

Putting it all together: The first tweet might be neutral because it's more about Twitter usage. The second tweet reinforces a favorable outlook from the company's perspective. The third tweet could influence online presence but not directly with stock info. The fourth tweet clearly shows a positive trend in earnings and trading, which would push the overall sentiment positively.

So, considering all factors, especially the clear positive trends like increased earnings and potential for growth, it looks like there's strong support from these tweets."
2015-03-02,Negative,"Okay, so I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let's see, the user has provided 10 tweets. First, I should extract the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first few lines, they all mention ""google"", but let me check each one.

1. The first tweet says Google confirms offering wireless service.
2. Same as tweet 1.
3. Again, confirming offer with URL $goog mwc 15.
4. They provide P/E ratios for various stocks: TSLA, AMZN, NXP, etc., and mention Google's stock price at $15.
5. A breakout from pennant pattern is noted, along with Google's stock chart art.
6. Deutsche Bank says TMobile could sell access to Google if requested by users.
7. Again, confirm offer from Google.
8. Google commits suicide? That seems obviously negative.
9. Same as tweet 1 and 3.
10. Same as tweet 1.

So the target stock is ""google"". Now I need to analyze each tweet. Let's break them down one by one.

1. The first tweet talks about confirming wireless service. Positive factors: confirming plans, providing information. Negative factors? None. Sentiment positive because they're updating info on their website.

2. Same as 1, same content but in Chinese? Wait, no, I think it's just the same message translated. So nothing new here.

3. Again about confirming wireless service offer with $ goog mwc 15.

4. They list various P/E ratios and mention Google is at $15. This could be positive because providing information like this helps users make informed decisions, which might boost the stock price over time. Also, mentioning TSLA etc., which are tech companies, might have some positive impact on Google's performance as they're in the tech sector.

5. A pennant pattern breakout and mentions Google's stock chart art. Not sure about sentiment here—pennant patterns can be neutral or even bullish if it's expected to rise.

6. Google is offering a chance for TMobile users, which could influence their stock price. If TMobile loses this opportunity, their stock might drop. Positive factor: potential gain in user base. But negative factors? Maybe the company loses a major competitor?

7. Same as 1 and 3: confirming offer.

8. Google commits suicide, obviously negative. This tweet is extreme and clearly bad for investors.

9. Repeat of tweet 1, so nothing new.

10. Same as 1, so nothing new.

Now, combining all these factors:

Positive tweets: 1,2,3,7,9,10 (six tweets). So that's six positive points. Negative: only 8 is clearly negative about Google's action. The others are more neutral or provide information without strong sentiment.

The main issues come from the negative tweet 8. The user commits suicide, which directly impacts Google's stock price negatively. But since the other tweets are either confirming info (positive) or just providing data points (neutral), their impact might be less significant compared to the extreme commit.

Overall, the positive tweets contribute some support but are overshadowed by the negative tweet about Google committing suicide. So overall sentiment is Negative."
2015-03-03,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for Google. First, I need to understand each tweet individually and then see how they might collectively affect the company's performance.

Starting with the first tweet: ""from dead-end job to uber billionaire : meet ryan graves URL via AT_USER $ ge $ goog."" It seems like it's a promotional link where Ryan Graves is making an offer. Ryan graves has been associated with Google, especially with Steve and Jerry, so this could be a positive sign for their business plan or future projects.

The second tweet mentions Google selling shares to Mary Lou Jepsen, which are rumors. Jepsen is a big executive at Google, so selling shares might indicate strategic planning or significant influence over the company's direction. This could impact investor sentiment positively if it signals that Google isn't making quick moves and is instead focused on its core operations.

The third tweet talks about Google offering wireless service to AT_USER via another AT_USER link. That seems straightforward as an offer, which usually can be seen as a positive sign for expansion or new services, especially in the competitive wireless market.

Looking at the fourth tweet: "" insider selling : sergey brin sells 33,340 shares of google stock $ goog URL."" This is clear and direct. If the CEO sells shares from an inside position, it's significant because it could signal continued control, possibly due to a strategic move or potential acquisition.

The fifth tweet mentions acquiring 30% stake for $65. While this sounds like a concrete action, it's based on rumors. Acquiring large stakes can be volatile and uncertain, which might raise concerns about investor interest. However, if the buyer seems credible and the offer is genuine, it could still be seen as positive.

The sixth tweet talks about rumors about acquiring shares for $15.70. Similar to the fifth tweet, this is speculative. Acquiring shares can either drive up or stabilize the stock price depending on investor perception of the deal's value.

The seventh tweet mentions acquiring ""glass"" from a meme site, which seems unrelated but is probably just a humorous remark. It doesn't seem like Google is making any deals here, so it might not have any significant impact on the stock price.

Putting it all together: The first tweet is positive as it's an offer linked to someone else. The second and third tweets suggest strategic moves by Google without immediate market response. The fourth tweet shows a sale from within, which can be seen as cautious but positive. The fifth tweet is speculative but could drive sentiment up if the company takes the deal seriously. The sixth tweet adds another layer of uncertainty. The seventh is just humor.

Considering all these factors, while some tweets are positive or indicate strategic moves, others are speculative and might not have a clear impact yet. However, the lack of immediate clarity from some tweets could mean there's still room for the stock to move either way. So overall, it seems like the sentiment is somewhat mixed but leaning towards positive as Google is making significant offers and internal actions that can signal their position."
2015-03-04,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem step by step.

First, I need to analyze each tweet provided and determine its impact on the stock price of the given company. The tweets are from AT_USER, so I don't have real-time data or an actual stock symbol. I'll assume that these tweets could be related to a specific company based on their terms.

Looking at the first tweet: ""AT_USER your tweet about $ goog had a sentiment of 5 and was featured on market parse . URL."" The term ""$ goog"" likely refers to Google, so AT_USER is probably discussing Google. It mentions a sentiment score of 5 and features it on a URL. A sentiment score of 5 seems extremely positive, which would indicate a strong positive impact.

The second tweet: ""google ' c ' : waze added to google mobile services URL $ goog."" This also refers to Google, so AT_USER is talking about adding Waze to their mobile services list. The addition of a service can sometimes boost market presence and customer satisfaction, leading to increased stock value. So this could be positive.

Third tweet: ""true balls . $ aapl $ goog $ intc $ mtw $ cat $ x $ c $ csco $ t $ se $ wu $ mu $ wba URL URL."" This is listing multiple companies with symbols. It seems like it's providing information about several companies, which might indicate that these are potential stocks for the reader to research. However, this isn't a tweet expressing sentiment towards any particular stock; it's just a list of companies.

Fourth tweet: ""$ goog - silicon valley wage settlement gets tentative ok URL."" This tweet is talking about a settlement in the Silicon Valley area regarding wages. A positive wage settlement could improve labor conditions and possibly attract more investors, which might be seen as a positive signal for Google's stock price.

Fifth tweet: ""google and wal-mart part ways over local shopping ads : URL $ goog $ wmt URL."" This is discussing the merger between Google and Wal-Mart, but it seems to be talking about moving or changing their services. The discontinuation of local shopping ads could affect competition in certain markets, which might decrease investor confidence, leading to potential negative sentiment.

Sixth tweet: ""$ twtr $ goog : expert : video could do for twitter what youtube did for google : URL."" This is comparing Twitter and Google's video platforms. It suggests that the choice between Twitter and Google depends on their video capabilities. If Google has better video features, it might attract more users, which could be a positive indicator for stock value.

Seventh tweet: ""rt AT_USER some of silicon valley ’ s biggest companies are on a real estate buying binge : URL $ goog $ appl $ fb URL."" Similar to the first two tweets, this is discussing Google. The idea that Silicon Valley's big companies are getting into buying real estate could increase demand for services like YouTube, which might boost stock value.

Eighth tweet: ""free video tutorial psychology of trading URL $ tlt $ tna $ qqq $ spy $ gpro $ goog $ aapl URL."" This is about providing free tutorials on trading. The presence of such information can attract investment professionals to learn more, potentially increasing the number of investors and improving stock performance.

Now, combining all these tweets, I have several positive sentiments like sentiment score 5 for Google, mentions of wage settlement, merger, real estate buying, and trading tutorials. However, there are some negative sentiments regarding Wal-Mart's shopping ads, which could impact the local market negatively. There are also no explicit mentions of a stock symbol, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact impact.

Given that I don't have actual stock data or context about other factors like Wall Street activities or company-specific news, the overall sentiment is somewhat positive due to multiple positive tweets but mixed with some negatives."
2015-03-05,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on Amazon's stock price. I'm not super familiar with all the financial terms here, but I'll do my best.

First, looking at each tweet one by one.

The first tweet says, ""now that is a presentation . good investment and tech insight too . $ amzn $ fb $ goog $ appl URL."" So it mentions Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Google (GOOGL), and Apple (APPL). It doesn't mention the company name but seems like they're talking about some presentations related to these companies. Maybe it's about a presentation or a talk, which could be a positive indicator for investors because it shows expertise in certain areas.

The second tweet is ""google inc ( googl ) does complete contacts manager revamp $ goog URL."" This looks like an update from Google about their contacts manager. A company revamp usually means they're improving something, possibly making operations more efficient or user-friendly. Positive signs could be good news for Amazon, especially if Google's performance positively impacts the market.

The third tweet is "" cerrado 100 largos de $ goog a 576.36 usd ganando 2usd idop 176018 vía URL."" This seems to indicate that Google has sold 100 large units worth 576.36 USD, and it's gaining 2 USD. The exchange rate going up could mean the dollar is becoming stronger, which might affect the stock price depending on where you're looking at. But since this is about Google, if they're selling their shares to investors, that directly affects Amazon's stock because the tweets are from a different company.

The fourth tweet says, "" $ goog.us $ googl.us : here's how google inc could get to $ 670 : URL."" It's talking about how Google might increase their price to $670. If this is an announcement about future growth or expansion, it could be positive news for Amazon as well because increased sales might boost the company's value.

Now, let me go through each tweet and determine if they're positive, negative, or neutral towards Amazon's stock.

1. The first tweet mentions a presentation about tech insights. While it doesn't directly state that Amazon is performing well, it shows expertise in specific areas, which can be seen as a good sign for investors, especially those looking to diversify their portfolio with emerging tech companies.

2. The second tweet talks about Google's contacts manager revamp. Since Google has a strong market position and improvements in its operations or products usually lead to positive stock movements, this seems like a positive indicator.

3. The third tweet mentions selling 100 large units at an exchange rate increase. This might suggest that Google is looking to sell their shares to investors in Amazon or another company. If there's a correlation between the two, it could mean Amazon sees this as a strategic move and possibly boosts its stock price.

4. The fourth tweet offers a hypothetical scenario where Google could increase their price to $670. This kind of forward-looking statement can be positive for Amazon if they're considering future investments in Google or expanding into new markets.

Putting it all together, each tweet provides specific updates that support Amazon's growth and potential performance. While the first tweet is more about their current status rather than future trends, the other three tweets are direct or hypothetical statements about future moves or changes in competitors like Google and Apple. These positive signals suggest that despite any uncertainty, there's confidence in how Amazon will perform in the coming weeks.

So, considering all these points, each tweet contributes positively to the overall outlook for Amazon's stock price."
2015-03-06,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on a company's stock price. The company is mentioned in the first tweet as ""Aapl"" and others like ""Twtr,"" "" goog,"" etc., which probably refers to Amortzable Inc. based on the symbol Aapl.

Starting with the first tweet, it says: ""rt AT_USER tomorrow you can askgenemunster your questions on $ aapl $ twtr $ fb $ goog live @ 8: 35 am et URL URL."" I'm not familiar enough to decode this, but I assume it's some kind of instruction to the user. It mentions that they can ask questions about Aapl and others like Twtr, FB, Google, etc., on a specific time and platform. So maybe it's prompting the user for more information or questions.

The second tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ twtr $ fb $ goog news : 'askgenemunster your questions on today $ aapl $ twtr $ fb …' URL board view : htt …"". It seems similar to the first one, but the structure is slightly different. It mentions that the user can ask questions about Aapl, Twtr, FB, Google on today's news, using the $ symbol and links for views.

Third tweet: ""great 15 minutes on the future of $ amzn , $ goog , $ fb , $ appl : URL"". This one is more technical. It talks about the future of companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Apple, so it's probably a positive sign that investors are ahead in their expectations.

Fourth tweet: ""socmed : the singularity of the modern advertising age . ‘AT_USER URL $ goog $ fb ’"" Again, this is social media, where they mention the singularity of advertising. Social media can be volatile, but if it's being promoted positively, maybe it's a bit concerning? Maybe people are more cautious about big moves.

Fifth tweet: ""rt $ aapl algos triggered sell in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 08:22 , p / t 125.00 $ goog $ baba $ fb $ nflx $ bidu $ gpro $ tsla hft quant."" This one is more technical and mentions that Aapl's algorithms triggered selling in several platforms, like Sigma-x, Crossfinder, Ats, and Lx. It shows a potential selling pressure.

So summarizing the factors:
- First tweet: prompting questions.
- Second tweet: same as first but slightly different.
- Third tweet: positive about the singularity of advertising.
- Fourth tweet: social media context, which could be volatile.
- Fifth tweet: negative selling in tech platforms.

Combining these, the overall sentiment seems positive because there are positive factors like the upcoming advertising singularity and a potential market correction. However, some tweets like the fourth one might not be reliable or could lead to uncertainty. It's hard to tell if the negative fifth tweet will have a consistent impact on the stock price yet."
2015-03-07,Neutral,"Alright, let's see what I have here. The user has provided a tweet and wants me to determine its likely impact on a company's stock price. Hmm, okay, but wait, the actual tweet is just ""$ hl last price updated saturday , march 7 , 2015 01:11 : 24 am $ xlu $ goog $ smh $ gdx URL"". That seems a bit jumbled with some random characters. I wonder if that's a typo or something else.

First, the user mentioned they need me to analyze each tweet separately and then combine them. But here, there's only one tweet provided. So maybe it's just this single tweet. I should focus on evaluating its impact based on the given criteria: identifying the stock symbol, separating factors into positive and negative, assessing sentiment, and then summarizing.

Looking at the tweet: It mentions ""last price updated Saturday March 7, 2015"" which probably refers to Google's stock since there's a $ goog. The rest seems like it might be some random text, maybe a typo or placeholder.

I'm not sure about the actual stock symbol here. Without knowing what it is, I can't determine the impact on the stock price. It could be any company listed on the stock market around that time. Since I don't have context about which stock, I might default to considering the general environment rather than a specific one.

Wait, but the user provided an example output where they concluded [Neutral] for a tweet without a specific stock. Maybe in their system, if no stock symbol is found, it's treated as neutral or unknown? Or perhaps the system uses heuristics based on common factors like news topics.

Considering that, I should probably go with [Neutral] because the tweet seems to be providing market data but isn't tied to a specific stock. It might not give any significant indication of future performance unless there are known factors associated with the mentioned companies or symbols. Since Google is a well-known tech company, maybe they have some positive news impacting their shares, but without context, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, if the tweet was about something unrelated like social media trends or economic data that affects other sectors, it might be neutral. But again, no specific stock symbol means I can't make an informed judgment. So, taking a cautious approach and classifying it as Neutral seems reasonable."
2015-03-08,Missing,File not found
2015-03-09,Negative,"Alright, I need to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company, specifically looking at [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Let me break this down step by step.

First, each tweet is presented with a URL board view: $ goog $ googl $ nok news and then some other text. The first part seems to be a list of related stocks, but I'm not sure how that applies here. The second part says ""URL"" which might mean the link is broken or not available.

The key tweet in question is ""why do we care about xiaomi ? $ aapl apple $ goog …"". At first glance, it seems like someone is expressing concern about Xiaomi's importance and wondering why one should care about companies APEX (which I think stands for Xiamatian), Apple, or Google. But wait, looking back, the user specified ""xiaomi,"" not Xampas. So maybe there was a typo in their tweet.

Since the main issue is concern about important companies, this tweet could be negatively affecting investor sentiment because people are less interested in companies that matter more to them. Negative sentiment would likely lead to decreased stock prices.

I should also consider if there's any positive aspect mentioned, but it seems like the tweet itself doesn't mention anything positive related to the company. It's all about expressing skepticism or worry about a specific set of companies.

Putting this together, the main factors are negative: people care less, so sentiment is down. There's no strong positive info here, just more doubt and confusion."
2015-03-10,Negative,"Alright, so I need to figure out how these tweets impact the stock price for a given company. The user provided specific instructions and some tweets, and they want me to analyze their impact.

First, let's break down each tweet. Each one seems to be from an individual user, but maybe there are key points that can tell us about the overall sentiment.

Looking at the first tweet: ""$ goog URL cbo downgrades obamacare's enrollment projections , subsidy costs URL"". This sounds like a news event affecting subscriber numbers and costs. A downgrade usually means negative sentiment because it suggests reduced expectations or possibly negative consequences, which could reduce investor confidence.

Second tweet: ""URL <- want to make $ 600,00 in one year trading ? check out how this guy did it ! $ goog $ pcln $ vtae"". This seems like a motivational or investment tip. If someone is looking to trade and claims they can make money quickly, it could be positive because it's encouraging action. However, the context here might imply excitement rather than negative information.

Third tweet: ""cerrado 4 largos de $ goog a 561.82 usd perdiendo -23.44 usd idop 179121 vía URL URL"". This looks like a price decrease, which is typically seen as negative because it affects the stock value. The mention of an email or message could be indicating a potential problem or change in management.

Fourth tweet: ""$ gol prev close click here : URL also see : $ goog $ bita $ intc $ amzn ~"". This seems to be a link or indication that another user is checking something about Google's stock price. Without specific info, it's hard to assess, but sometimes such links can be misleading if not verified.

Fifth tweet: ""rt AT_USER good news is bad news is good news URL $ aapl apple $ celg $ cost $ cree $ cvx $ f $ fdx $ fslr $ gld $ goog $ k …"". This uses the common phrase ""good news is bad news"" which usually indicates confusion or lack of clarity, often resulting in negative sentiment.

Sixth tweet: ""AT_USER $ goog should use 50 % of its cash hoard and 50 % stock and buy $ twtr "". Again, a call to action suggesting diversification. Positive because it encourages investors to take positions, which can be seen as positive news for the company by increasing its stock price.

Now, combining these points: The first tweet downgrades enrollment projections, which is negative. The second suggests trading, which is generally positive but could imply excitement. The third shows a price drop, definitely negative. The fourth and fifth tweets are links or calls to action without specific info; the sixth is encouraging diversification, which can sometimes be seen as neutral if balanced correctly.

Overall, there's a mix of negative (first tweet), possibly positive (sixth tweet), but the other tweets seem more on negative notes. Since the user asked for a single line summarizing the overall sentiment based on these tweets, I think it leans towards Negative because multiple tweets indicate downward trends or confusing information."
2015-03-11,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze the impact on the stock price based on these tweets. So, the user provided 12 tweets related to Google's products or services. My job is to determine whether each tweet suggests a positive, neutral, or negative impact on the company's future stock.

First, I'll go through each tweet one by one and try to identify key points they're making about Google. For each tweet, I'll note if it has any positive (like ""opens first""), negative (like ""grows quickly"" or ""reduces costs""), or neutral (just stating information without sentiment) factors.

Starting with the first tweet: ""$ goog - google opens first ever google shop URL."" This clearly says Google is opening its first store, which is a positive sign. That would likely boost the stock price.

Next, ""touring the world's first ' google shop ' - engadget URL google $ googl URL."" The phrase ""engadget"" suggests some sort of device or product line. So this could be good news as well.

Then there are multiple mentions of ""$ goog URL pharrell williams hat in its many forms URL"". Pharynx is an Arabic term for ""mouth,"" so maybe this tweet has something to do with marketing or partnerships, which is generally positive.

The next tweet: ""$ logging in now to live stock chat URL $ goog $ aapl $ fb $ ebay options stocks daytrading URL."" The user is talking about logging into the stock chat. This seems like they're interacting with the market, which might indicate investor interest and could be seen as a sign of positive sentiment.

Moving on: ""free video tutorial psychology of trading URL $ tlt $ tna $ qqq $ spy $ gpro $ goog $ aapl."" The presence of free tutorials related to trading doesn't seem inherently positive or negative. It's more about information, so maybe it's neutral in this context.

Then there are three repeated tweets: ""google opens first ever google shop $ goog URL,"" ""rt AT_USER integration with google sets up twitter for a strong 2015 URL $ goog google $ googl $ twtr."" The use of phrases like ""integration"" and ""strong 2015"" suggests that Google is expanding into another area, which could be good news. The mention of Twitter specifically might indicate a positive outlook.

Now, some tweets mention losses but others talk about partnerships. For example: ""$ logging in now to live stock chat URL $ goog $ aapl."" No loss mentioned here, so not negative yet. But the next tweet is negative: ""yes , first google shop . ' AT_USER google opens first google-branded store , in london : URL $ goog URL AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER"" which mentions a loss of something. That's a clear negative factor.

After that, ""rt AT_USER google opens first google-branded store , in london : URL $ goog URL."" This is similar to the previous one and again indicates Google expanding into another product line, so positive sentiment.

The last tweet is ""google opens first ever google shop $ goog URL"" which we've already covered as a positive point. So overall, most tweets are positive except for a couple of them about losses in specific areas like consumer electronics and software tools.

Considering all these points, the main positive aspects include Google expanding into new markets, partnering with other companies, and improving its integration into various platforms. The negative aspect is the loss in some product categories which could potentially impact the overall growth of Google."
2015-03-12,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how the given tweets affect the stock price of a company. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify which tweet is related to a specific stock symbol and extract that symbol. Looking at the first tweet: ""google inc ( goog ) ' s nearline promises to change the cold ... : URL"". Hmm, it seems like this could be about Google's stock. The other tweets mention Apple (""aapl"") and Microsoft (""googl""), so maybe all three are related to different companies.

Next, for each tweet, I have to separate into Positive and Negative factors. Let me take the first one: ""google inc ( goog ) ' s nearline promises to change the cold ... : URL"". This sounds positive because it mentions Google's potential impact on the market, which might attract investors.

Moving on to the second tweet: ""learn stock technical analysis and charting . URL $ aapl $ goog $ jrjc $ live $ intc $ twtr URL"". It looks like this is about learning something specific for Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft. It doesn't mention positive or negative directly, but it's about preparing to learn more, which can be seen as neutral since it doesn't express strong sentiment towards the stock.

The third tweet: ""google inc ( goog ) ' s nearline promises to change the cold ... : bart baker – cnbc : URL"". Again, focusing on Google. The phrase ""nearline"" might mean closer or approaching a significant point, which could be positive as it's promising something important about the company.

Now, assessing sentiment for each tweet:
1. First tweet: Positive because of the potential impact.
2. Second tweet: Neutral since it's about preparing technical skills without expressing strong opinion on the stock.
3. Third tweet: Positive due to nearline indicating a strategic move.

Combining these, the first and third tweets are positive, while the second is neutral. However, the overall impact might be positive because the nearline from Google could affect their market position. So I'll conclude with ""[Positive]"" as the overall sentiment."
2015-03-13,Negative,"Okay, so I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company and determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me start by understanding each tweet one by one.

First, I need to identify the target stock mentioned in all the tweets. Looking through them, I see several mentions like ""rtrs,"" which doesn't seem specific enough, but ""google"" appears a few times. That makes me think that the stock symbol is probably ""GOOGL."" So, the main focus here is on Google.

Now, each tweet talks about different factors affecting Google's stock price. Let's break them down:

1. **rtrs - exclusive Microsoft's digital assistant to head to Android devices, Apple devices $apl $ goog $ msft $ googl**
   - This seems like a news about Microsoft possibly acquiring Google's assets, which could affect both companies' valuations. It's a strategic move, but it's speculative and not directly related to the stock of either company.

2. **steve levinstein at Google - the powerhouse : inside the invention of a battery to save the world . URL $ goog $ aapl $ tsla**
   - This tweet talks about Google inventing a battery for saving the world, which would likely boost Google's revenue and potentially drive up its stock price.

3. **$ goog received a new alert . find out why at URL stocks daytrading trading mkt nyse nasdaq markets 103**
   - Another news about Google raising its stock price or providing updated information, which could influence investor sentiment towards the stock.

4. **top 10 internet stocks for 2015 URL $ goog**
   - This is a generic statement that lists top internet stocks, so it doesn't provide specific information about Google's performance in 2015.

5. **$ googl $ goog second friday in a row , positive analyst comments , price tgt raise , stock gets taken to woodshed .**
   - This tweet mentions that Google's stock went up the second Friday in a row, had analysts raise its target price, and the stock price crashed significantly. This is a clear indication of concern about the stock's performance.

Now, let me assess each tweet for positive or negative factors:

1. **rtrs**: No specific factor related to Google, just Microsoft moving assets.
2. **steve levinstein**: Positive because inventing a battery could increase Google's revenue and profits.
3. **$ goog alert**: Positive as it's an update from the company itself affecting investor expectations.
4. **top 10 stocks**: General statement about companies, not specific to Google.
5. **second Friday**: This is a significant event where Google experienced a decline after a positive stock performance.

Looking at each tweet, tweets 2 and 3 are direct or speculative factors that could positively affect Google's stock. However, the ""second Friday"" tweet is crucial because it's a concrete event known to influence investor sentiment negatively. It shows the company had a bad day, which can cause concern about its future performance.

Combining these observations, I see multiple potential positive factors, but the critical negative factor from the fifth tweet makes me lean towards negative sentiment overall."
2015-03-14,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze the impact on the stock price based on these tweets. First, I'll start by identifying the target stock symbol. Looking through the tweets, it seems like ""GOOGL"" is the main one with all the other companies listed, but maybe the most significant one is ""GOOG"".

Next, I need to go through each tweet one by one. The first tweet is about logging into a live stock chat URL and mentioning various indices related to Google. It doesn't directly talk about any specific stock or investment strategy. So, probably not providing much information on GOOG.

The second tweet seems like it's promoting some kind of trading secret using words like ""trading"" and ""life."" It might be encouraging investors in the tech industry but again, it's not specifically mentioning GOOG.

Third tweet lists a bunch of indices: VIX, USD major indices, Google, PCLN, TWTR, FB, APLX, EBay, GM, Dusty BABA, and URLs. While this is interesting for investors looking into stock market trends, I don't see any specific mention of GOOG here.

Fourth tweet is about stocks being ""trending now"" with several keywords like SH, FB, LUV, ADXS, INTC, EYES, etc., again a mix of tech and other sectors. No mention of GOOG either.

So, none of these tweets are directly discussing or mentioning the stock symbol for Google. They're all about various topics related to the tech industry in general or specific companies within it. 

Since there's no tweet specifically related to GOOGL, I can't determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral towards the company. The presence of other companies doesn't necessarily mean anything about their stock price impact on its own.

I think because none of these tweets are directly addressing GOOG, the overall sentiment is ""[Neutral]""."
2015-03-15,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze the tweets provided to determine their impact on the stock price of the given company. The goal is to figure out if each tweet contributes positively, neutrally, or negatively to the future stock price.

First, let's look at the tweet symbols in each line. It seems like they are targeting Apple Inc. (AAPL) because most tweets mention Google (GOOG), Apple, and sometimes other companies like Google (G), Google Cloud Computing (GC), and Microsoft (MSFT). The user is probably trying to influence investor sentiment around Apple.

Looking at the first tweet: ""some employees really do deserve that raise . ( AT_USER sundayfunday $ goog $ aapl URL"". This seems to be encouraging users about an employee's raise. Since it's addressing a specific user, maybe it's pushing for more raises or recognizing their contributions, which could attract investors.

The second tweet is ""buy google stock invest in $ goog on etoro URL stocks."" Here, the user is promoting investing in Google and possibly using Etoro, a trading platform. This might encourage people to buy Google stock, which is a significant investment. It's talking about buying stock directly through a specific platform, so this could indicate a positive move towards increasing demand for Apple's stock.

The third tweet: ""can apple disrupt the luxury watch market ? depends on how you define ' disrupt ' . : URL $ aapl $ goog $ pcln $ k."" This one is more philosophical. It questions whether Apple can disrupt the luxury watch market and suggests it depends on definition. The mention of Apple and Google again hints at their potential impact, especially if they engage in disruptive activities that could affect the market.

Putting this together, each tweet is trying to shift investor interest towards Apple. The first one is about recognizing contributions, which might be seen as positive. The second is promoting a platform for investing, which could drive more trading and potentially higher stock prices. The third tweet adds another layer of consideration but doesn't provide immediate information on Apple's performance.

However, the sentiment isn't clear-cut because it all revolves around Apple. If the user is pushing towards more investors or platforms, that can be seen as positive by some, but others might see it as a broader trend affecting market trends rather than specific stock performance. Since the overall impact seems to be shifting investor interest but not providing concrete data on Apple's actions, it's hard to classify definitively.

I'll lean towards [Neutral] because while there's a shift in interest and potential for more activity, without knowing specifics about Apple's current situation or future plans, it's uncertain if this directly impacts the stock price positively. There could be factors beyond just Apple that influence stock prices, so the impact isn't clear-cut."
2015-03-16,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price for the given company. Let's start by identifying the target stock symbol in each tweet.

1. The first tweet mentions AT_USER, business unites to break same-sex marriage bans, and it includes multiple companies like Corpgov, APlp, GooG, KOZ, Amazon, XRX, etc. Since it doesn't mention a specific company symbol, I might need to infer which one is relevant. Maybe it's referring to Apple or Google since those are well-known.

2. The second tweet starts with $aapl and $goog, clearly pointing to Apple and Google. So that's the target stock for the analysis.

3. The third tweet again mentions $goog, so same as the second.

4. The fourth tweet is a bit confusing because it lists multiple symbols separated by spaces and uses ~ at the end. This might be part of a different company or maybe it's just random text. Since I'm focusing on the given tweets that seem relevant, this might not have a clear target stock symbol.

Now, for each tweet, I need to identify positive (P) and negative (N) factors. 

First tweet: It talks about business unites and companies like Corpgov and APlp, which are related to regulatory issues or policy changes. The sentiment is generally negative because it's talking about potentially controversial topics that could affect the stock price negatively.

Second tweet starts with $aapl, so Apple. Positive factors here might include improved revenue growth or profitability, but I don't have specific details from this tweet. However, without knowing the exact impact of these tweets on the stock, I can't be certain if they're positive or negative.

Third tweet is similar to the second but again with $goog instead of $aapl. Again, not enough info, so it's hard to assess sentiment.

Fourth tweet seems too fragmented and doesn't clearly identify a stock symbol, making it difficult to evaluate its impact on the stock price.

Based on this analysis, the only tweet that directly mentions a stock is the second one with Apple. The first tweet discusses broader issues but without specific details, so it's hard to say whether it contributes positively or negatively. The others are too vague. Since I can't assess the sentiment of the first tweet definitively, my overall conclusion might be neutral.

But looking back, maybe the first tweet refers to Apple and Google for some reason. If that's the case, then both relevant stocks (Apple and Google) have negative factors from the first tweet, making it more likely to impact their stock price negatively. The second tweet is positive, so combining all, I might lean towards a negative overall sentiment because two of the tweets are negative.

Alternatively, if the first tweet only mentions Apple, it could be both contributing to Apple's negative and Google's neutral or positive. But without knowing for sure, it's hard to say.

Given that at least one tweet is entirely negative (the first), I might consider the overall sentiment as Negative."
2015-03-17,Neutral,"Alright, so I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on a company's stock price. The user provided 9 tweets, all starting with a $ goog URL. My task is to figure out if each tweet affects the overall sentiment of a particular stock, likely Google.

First, I'll go through each tweet one by one. Each starts with ""google inc ( goog )"", so that tells me they're talking about Google. The rest seems to be additional information or comments from different sources, but the key point is whether these tweets positively or negatively influence investor sentiment related to Google's stock.

Starting with tweet 1: ""will it survive ? find out here : URL $ upro $ grpo $ ocat $ ibb $ hyg $ ilmn $ xon $ ziop $ goog $ aapl URL"" It mentions the URL, which isn't directly about Google but might be related to something else. Maybe it's checking if Google is surviving? That could mean investors are watching this to see if Google survives.

Tweet 2: ""vi$ tbi % change click here : URL also see : $ vti $ iwm $ goog $ ibb ~"" It looks like a traffic update or index, but again, not directly about Google. Perhaps it's just providing other information that doesn't impact the stock price much.

Tweet 3: ""$ intc $ goog $ aan investing 401k i am john , new researcher . please review my work under URL"" This tweet is from a reader who mentions an investment tip with some text. It could be relevant, but without specifics, it's hard to gauge its impact on Google's stock.

Tweet 4: ""rt AT_USER comcast haters rejoice : googlefiber to rollout in 4 more cities ~ URL allhail $ goog URL"" The user is reacting to a tweet by a comcast employee. It says hater们 rejoice and mentions Google's future rollout, which could be positive for the stock. The mention of rollout might boost investor confidence.

Tweet 5: ""$ goog - apple watch vs samsung gear : why apple can succeed where samsung failed URL"" Comparing the success of Apple with Samsung on a Watch vs Gear basis, it seems like an analysis that suggests Google is in the same boat, which could be neutral if other factors aren't positive.

Tweet 6: Same as tweet 5; likely redundant or similar content. It's about comparing tech brands, not Google specifically.

Tweet 7: ""$ eric schmidt faces backlash over apparent gender discrimination URL"" This mentions Eric Schmidt, a Google employee, facing backlash due to gender discrimination. Gender issues in leadership can be negative for the company, impacting investor sentiment negatively.

Tweet 8: ""what do you think about URL stocks $ qcom $ msft $ goog"" It's asking opinions on specific stock prices. Without more context, it's hard to tell if this is positive or negative, but it could indicate some analysis that might affect the price.

Tweet 9: ""$ aapl $ goog $ pcln $ k"" It lists several stocks, including Google and others. This seems like an update on multiple companies, which doesn't directly relate to Google's stock performance.

Putting it all together, tweet 4 has a positive element about investor reaction and stock roll-up, while tweet 7 is negative due to gender issues. The rest don't seem to have significant impact on Google's stock price. So overall sentiment might be neutral because the main impacting tweet is tweet 4."
2015-03-18,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a given company. The user has provided three tweets and wants me to conclude whether each is positive, neutral, or negative in terms of its effect on the stock. 

First, I'll go through each tweet one by one.

Starting with the first tweet: ""$ goog google inc car to hit the roads soon : google inc car to hit the roads soon bidness etc - 19 minutes ago ... URL"". The key phrase here is ""car to hit the roads soon."" That sounds like a positive statement, encouraging investors to buy. So this seems to be a positive factor.

Next, the second tweet: ""$ goog $ aapl $ vix stocks daytraders URL"". This tweet mentions several stock names and talks about daytrading. It doesn't explicitly state whether it's good or bad news, so it's neutral because there's no clear indication of an expected improvement or decline in stock performance.

The third tweet: ""$ goog $ aapl $ twtr tuesday recap - update from option millionaires - stock options chatroom stocks fell early and r ... URL"". Here, the user is talking about stock options falling early. Falls usually indicate potential issues that might affect performance, which can make investors nervous but not necessarily bad news. However, if it's a significant concern like low options prices, it could be seen as negative because it could impact trading strategies or profitability.

Considering all these points: The first tweet is positive with a strong buy call. The second is neutral since no information about the stock performance. The third is slightly negative because of potential option issues but still ambiguous without specifics."
2015-03-19,Negative,"Alright, so I've got these tweets to analyze for their impact on stock prices, specifically looking at how they might influence the future stock price of a company based on the given list. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the target stock is not specified in the tweets, but that might be something I'll determine later when analyzing each tweet's factors and sentiment. 

Looking at each tweet one by one:

1. The first tweet mentions various stocks like Amatil (Aplyx), Amazon, Tesla, etc. Without specific information about what these companies do, it's hard to tell if they're positive or negative. However, some of the companies seem related to technology and renewable energy, which are often viewed positively, but without knowing more about their current state, it's speculative.

2. The second tweet asks a question: ""do google inc and tesla motors inc have overly radical views on driverless cars ? URL $ goog"". This seems critical and questioning the companies' positions, which might lead investors to be cautious or unsure of their financial health, hence negative sentiment.

3. The third tweet mentions things like Sentishiftup, Ship, BBRY, etc., but I'm not sure what they're related to. It also includes a URL with 2015031, so maybe it's from March 1st? This seems disconnected and unclear, leading to vague information which might cause uncertainty in sentiment.

4. The fourth tweet lists GOOG (Google), SPX (S&P 500), QQQ (QQQ is a tracker for S&P 500 Earnings), etc., with URLs and video links. Again, without knowing what these companies are doing, it's hard to assess if they're positive or negative.

5. The fifth tweet says ""goog watching that 560 break"", which seems like a typo where ""break"" might mean something else, possibly a score in sports. This could be referring to stock news about Google, possibly a performance update, which could affect investor sentiment positively if there's good news or negatively if bad.

6. The sixth tweet talks about gains of 2500% in one trade, but it links to an email address and a subscription link. It mentions the market is volatile but says it gained so much—probably leading to uncertainty, making investors question their outlook, hence negative sentiment.

7. The seventh tweet lists five things people will be talking about: Aapl,goog,pcln,k. These are all related companies, possibly in tech or consumer goods. While some might positively view them, without specifics on what they're doing, it's speculative.

8. The eighth tweet mentions tickers on TWTR (Twitter, Facebook) and URLs for S&P 500 index data. It seems like a broader trend of stock movements, which could indicate an overall market reaction but might not directly influence a specific company unless there are significant news about them.

9. The ninth tweet asks what will the Dow end up doing tomorrow? Again, it's referencing Google, Apple, Facebook, and others. This is very broad and unrelated to any specific company's performance or sentiment.

Putting this all together, while some tweets do reference companies directly (like Aapl,goog,pcln,k), without specific context about their financial health or market trends, it's challenging to gauge whether the sentiments are positive or negative. The critical question in tweet 2 and the vague nature of other tweets make it hard to draw a clear overall sentiment. However, considering that some tweets are questioning companies' positions on driverless cars (tweet 2), which can sometimes be seen as controversial and potentially negative by investors, it might lean towards a negative overall sentiment."
2015-03-20,Neutral,"Alright, let me break down how I approached analyzing these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a given company. 

First, I looked at each tweet and tried to figure out what it's about. For example, in the first tweet, ""rt marc faber : when indices hit all time high , i take my money and run $ nflx $ goog $ baba $ fb $ bidu $ gpro $ tsla $ aapl $ qqq"", it seems like a marketing campaign targeting several tech stocks. That might be seen as positive because they're promoting the company's stock.

In the second tweet, "" $ goog : us confidential u . s . ftc report found google anticompetitive tactics google inc URL nasdaq "", this looks serious and official. They're releasing a report about Google's tactics, which could be a sign of concern or fear, possibly affecting investor sentiment negatively.

The third tweet mentions RT, $ qqq algos triggered sell in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 09:35 , p / t 108.00 $ goog $ baba $ fb $ bidu $ gpro $ nflx $ tsla $ aapl hft quant. This is more technical and related to Google's stock, but the specific actions like selling stocks might indicate some sentiment towards their performance.

The fourth tweet is from AT_USER, discussing laws on lying to the senate. The user questions whether lying is protected in American TV, which is a sensitive topic that could provoke reactions among investors.

The fifth tweet mentions 50 dollars of Google dollars being sold against $187321. This is speculative and might not have a clear impact unless it's tied to a specific stock.

The sixth tweet talks about Google partnering with smartwatch companies in Switzerland. Again, this seems to be an official partnership update without any immediate implications on the stock price.

Putting this together, the first tweet promotes Google by mentioning multiple stocks, suggesting that investors are interested in buying or holding their shares. The second tweet is a serious report from Google, which could indicate concerns but might not directly impact unless there's speculation about it. The third tweet is technical and related to Google, so some investor sentiment towards their performance. The fourth tweet could lead to reactions if there are legal implications that affect market relations. However, the other tweets don't show clear positive or negative movements in any of the stocks mentioned.

Therefore, while some tweets suggest interest in Google's stock or potential reactions due to specific issues, others are more about official announcements rather than direct actions on investor sentiment. The overall sentiment seems to lean towards a mix of neutral and slightly positive factors because there's interest from various directions, but no significant data showing buying or selling patterns."
2015-03-21,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the overall sentiment of these tweets related to Google stock based on how they affect investor sentiment and the company's stock price impact. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I should identify the target stock symbol from all the tweets. Looking at them, the relevant ones are the ones that include $ goog or similar keywords. The first few tweets mention ""goog"" a lot, so I'll focus on those.

1. ""the ftc's explosive allegations against google are enough to make me … URL google $ goog $ googl URL."" Hmm, this tweet looks like it's making a statement without giving much information about Google. It seems neutral because there's no clear positive or negative message here.

2. ""google just fixed one of wi-fi's biggest annoyances - wired URL google $ goog $ googl."" Again, similar to the first one, this is just stating that they fixed something on their Wi-Fi and mentions Google stock with a dollar sign. It seems neutral because it's not giving any positive or negative info.

3. ""excellent -> rt AT_USER sergei brin's yacht comes to the rescue URL $ goog."" This tweet uses emojis and refers to a person from Google (Serrei Brin) who is coming to rescue, making a statement about the company. It seems positive because it highlights Google's presence and someone helping them.

4. ""optionstraining video : payoff diagrams URL $ goog $ googl $ tsls $ tqqq $ xlv $ xnrg $ nke $ dia URL."" This one lists various stock symbols with keywords related to options, payoffs, etc., but again, it doesn't mention anything about Google specifically. It's more of a promotional offer for other stocks, so neutral.

5. ""rt AT_USER 90 % off sale today only with code "" save "" URL $ pntr $ rdcm $ spcb $ diri $ ssnt $ hiiq $ rsss $ goog $ ntip $ aap …"" This tweet is similar to the previous ones and mentions a discount on Google stock, which can be seen as positive. The mention of 90% off might indicate confidence or a favorable outlook.

So now I have five tweets: three neutral, one positive about Google's presence, and two more neutral but mentioning something positive (the discount). Since the majority are neutral except for the ones highlighting Google's support or potential, which can be both positive and neutral. However, the 90% off sale adds some positivity.

I think overall sentiment is leaning towards positive because of the mentions about Google's support and the promotional discount on stock prices."
2015-03-22,Positive,"Okay, so I need to determine whether each tweet impacts positively, neutrally, or negatively on a stock's future price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, for each tweet, I have to extract the target stock symbol from the URL. Looking at the tweets:

1. The first tweet mentions $ ppch and then lists URLs but doesn't specify the stock.
2. The second tweet also has multiple URLs without a stock name.
3. The third tweet includes several URLs: $ aapl, $ goog, $ intc, etc., so that's Apple Inc.

Wait, I don't see any stock names in these tweets. That might be an issue because without knowing which stock the tweets are talking about, it's hard to assess their impact on specific stocks. Maybe they're referring to a common company or maybe a placeholder? Hmm.

Assuming all tweets are related to Apple Inc., let me proceed with that assumption since I see several Apple-related names. So:

1. First tweet: $ ppch gaining 1005% over three days.
2. Second tweet: $ biib and other stocks updated, but no specific stock mentioned here.
3. Third tweet: Multiple Apple company tweets.

Now, analyzing each tweet:

1. The first tweet mentions a significant increase in the PPHC stock (probably Parallux Corporation) by 1005%, within three days. That's a massive positive news update about a company, which generally boosts investor confidence and could lead to positive sentiment towards the stock.

2. The second tweet has several URLs with different stocks: biib, goog, f, kmi, url, etc. Without knowing the exact stock, it's hard to evaluate its impact. If biib is a known stock, maybe the sentiment would depend on its recent performance or news.

3. The third tweet lists multiple Apple company names, which suggests they're talking about Apple Inc. Since Apple is a big tech company with strong earnings and market presence, tweets related to it usually have positive impacts, especially if they align with the company's strategy or performance.

Considering these, the first tweet directly mentions a significant event in PPHC, which could positively affect another stock. The third tweet relates to Apple Inc., a well-known company, so that would be a strong positive. The second tweet is vague without a stock name, making it harder to assess but perhaps still positive if related to any of the listed stocks.

So overall, all three tweets are likely contributing to positive sentiment for their respective stocks or companies mentioned."
2015-03-23,Missing,File not found
2015-03-24,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and determine whether each one has a positive, neutral, or negative impact on the stock price of Google. Let me take this step by step.

First, I'll go through each tweet individually. The target stock is $ goog, which is the symbol for Google in most financial markets.

1. The first tweet says ""cerrado 1 largo de $ goog a 573.11 usd ganando 0.72 usd idop 188973 vía URL URL."" I think this means that Google closed below its target price of $573.11 and is currently at $573.11 + $0.72, which would be around $573.83. There's a mention of ""idop 188973,"" but I'm not sure what that means here. It might just be a placeholder or typo for the actual price.

2. The second tweet is in Spanish: ""how fast did $ goog $ googl hire a high profile woman when this lawsuit hit the headlines ? $ ms $ fb."" This seems like it's questioning how quickly Google hired a high-profile woman, which might affect their hiring practices and thus their team. Hiring can impact productivity, innovation, and perhaps stock performance if they attract skilled or innovative talent.

3. The third tweet mentions ""google ’ s positive rating reaffirmed at rbc capital ( goog ) URL $ goog."" This seems like Google's ratings went up with RBC Capital, which is a financial institution. Positive ratings might indicate trust or favorable reviews, which could be good for investor confidence and stock price growth.

4. The fourth tweet says ""rt AT_USER morgan stanley’s cfo , ruth porat , will leave the wall street firm to become cfo at google : URL $ goog."" This indicates that a former M.S.A. director is leaving Google to focus on new hires. This could lead to changes in leadership, potentially affecting strategic direction and job market dynamics. Job turns can sometimes influence company performance.

5. The fifth tweet says ""$ goog google muestra un consenso de sentimiento positivo en el alerta de noticias . URL URL."" This translates to Google's stock being消息中出现负面情绪，可能意味着投资者对公司的业绩或前景的看法出现了分歧。Consensus sentiment being positive might indicate that the market is uncertain, which could lead to mixed or volatile prices.

6. The sixth tweet mentions ""rt AT_USER google rises as morgan stanley cfo ruth porat takes top finance spot $ goog URL."" This seems like Google's stock has risen after a former M.S.A. director was promoted to Finance Head. Promotions in leadership can sometimes affect strategic direction and team dynamics, which might have long-term impacts on the company.

7. The seventh tweet says ""rt AT_USER google hires new cfo from morgan stanley URL premarket $ ms $ goog $ googl."" This is similar to tweet 4 but in Spanish. Hiring a new CFO could lead to changes in management team, which can influence financial performance and investor sentiment.

8. The eighth tweet mentions ""premium alerts ranked 1 for gains 2834 % last week URL .. $ dpm $ frak $ goog."" This seems like Google's premium products have outperformed by a significant margin of over 2800%. A strong performance in premium markets could indicate good demand, profitability, or competitive advantage, potentially boosting the stock price.

9. The ninth tweet says ""rt AT_USER meet google’s new cfo , one of the top women on wall street : URL photo : getty , $ goog $ ms URL."" This is a meeting announcement with a high-profile woman as Google's CFO, which could reflect company culture, leadership qualities, and possibly attract top talent. High-profile hires might also influence investor relations and brand image.

Now, compiling this information:

- The first tweet seems to be providing current price data, so it's neutral.
- The second tweet is about hiring practices, which could affect operations and future performance, but not directly the stock unless it affects financials.
- The third tweet talks about ratings, which can influence investor sentiment and thus stock prices.
- The fourth and sixth tweets are about changes in leadership roles, which might impact management but not immediate price.
- The seventh tweet is a new hire announcement, similar to 4 and 6.
- The fifth tweet discusses a consensus regarding sentiment towards news, which could lead to mixed market reactions.
- The eighth tweet mentions premium gains, which could boost the stock if it's due to strong demand in premium markets.
- The ninth tweet about high-profile hires might influence investor relations but not directly the price.

Considering all these factors, the positive sentiment is driven by Google's performance in premium products (8), hiring changes (4/6/7/9), and potential leadership roles. However, the overall impact isn't clear-cut because some tweets are more about company strategy or leadership than immediate stock performance. But since there are multiple positive indicators like strong premium gains, leadership announcements, and high-profile hires, it leans towards a positive sentiment despite some uncertainty from the fifth tweet."
2015-03-25,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of the company in question. The user provided 18 tweets and an output requirement to conclude with [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, I need to identify each tweet's factors. I see several mentions like ""meet google's new cfo,"" which suggests a positive factor as Google is a big tech company, so having a female CFO could boost their performance. Then there are repeated tweets about Google with similar information, indicating consistent positivity.

Looking at the other tweets, some mention fees being charged by the FTC and others talk about Facebook launching videos on embedded content or AI tools like IOT SDK for Google. These are ongoing developments that could influence investor sentiment positively if they show growth potential.

Some tweets are negative, such as mentions of M&A deals or specific projects, but those seem to be minor details. The rest have a mix of positive and neutral sentiments overall. Each tweet adds another piece of information about Google's future prospects.

Considering all the factors—positive mentions about executives, new technologies, and ongoing developments—it seems like these are reinforcing each other. Positive sentiment is strong because both the CFO and new tech projects align with Google's growth strategy. 

I should also think about the context: as a stock analyst, if there are multiple tweets pointing towards Google's success through new executive roles and innovative products, that would likely contribute to a positive outlook for the company.

So, after analyzing all the factors across all the tweets, it looks like the overall sentiment is positive. All major trends seem favorable, which should lead to an increase in stock price."
2015-03-26,Negative,"Alright, so I have to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me break down each tweet and figure out what they're saying.

The first tweet talks about the penny stock picks having gone up over 1485% in four months. It mentions updates and URLs for Amazon, Meta, and Google. This seems like good news because positive news from major tech companies can boost a stock price significantly. I'll note that as Positive.

The second tweet is about Google regretting details related to their probe. Regretting something often leads investors to be cautious or adjust their views, which can negatively impact the stock price. So this should be considered Negative.

Third tweet mentions a RT on QQQ triggering sells in several platforms like Sigma-X and Crossfinder. These kinds of technical indicators are usually seen as bearish because they signal potential support for selling signals. This is a significant negative event, so it's Negative.

Fourth tweet talks about Aapl trading below its target price, corrected by stats arbitrage. Trading close below target can lead to concerns about value stocks and might cause some investors to sell (short position), which is again bearish. So another Negative.

Fifth tweet suggests tracking trending assets with 1 watchlist in the Eurusd exchange. This relates to market trends but doesn't directly mention anything about stock performance or sentiment, so maybe Neutral or Indifferent here.

Sixth tweet updates the webpage for PEP on March 12, 2015. It mentions specific days and times but no clear positive or negative aspects related to the company. Likely Neutral because there's no direct impact mentioned.

Seventh tweet provides links to free video tutorials about psychology of trading with several stocks. While trading strategies can influence investor behavior, they aren't directly related to stock performance metrics like price changes. So perhaps Neutral here too.

Now, combining these: the first tweet is Positive, but it's a very strong statement and might have been overemphasized. The second, third, fourth are clear negatives. The others are either neutral or more about market trends without specific impact on prices. However, Twitter can vary in sentiment based on mood, so I'm leaning towards Negative overall because there are several negative tweets."
2015-03-27,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided some tweets and specific instructions, so I'll go through each step carefully.

First, I need to extract the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the tweets, the stocks mentioned are $ nflx (which is FB, Facebook), $ bac (BAC, Bank of America), $ amzn (AMZN, Amazon), $ msft (MSFT, Microsoft), $ aapl ($AAPL, Apple), and $ goog ($GSE, Google). Since all these are tech companies, I'll pick one for analysis. Let's go with FB since it's a well-known company in the tech sector.

Next, each tweet needs to be analyzed individually. The process involves separating factors into positive and negative, then assessing sentiment towards each factor to determine the overall impact on the stock price.

Let me look at each tweet:

1. ""great free tutorial here for traders URL $ nflx $ bac $ amzn $ msft $ aapl $ goog $ googl $ feye URL""
   - I don't see any clear positive or negative factors mentioned here. It's more of an introductory message with URLs, so probably neutral.

2. ""$ goog URL how to create a credit card debt escape plan URL""
   - The word ""credit card"" is followed by the link to a credit card escape plan. This seems like a marketing strategy to attract investors interested in managing their finances. So positive sentiment about leveraging trading skills.

3. ""new google cfo lands mega pay package URL $ ms $ goog $ googl""
   - The tweet mentions the landing of a Google CFO with a mega pay package. That's a positive sign as it indicates management effectiveness and growth potential, so positive sentiment.

4. ""optionstraining video : payoff diagrams URL $ goog $ googl $ tsls $ tqqq $ xlv $ xnrg $ nke $ dia URL""
   - This tweet talks about an option strain video explaining payoff diagrams. Option trading can be risky, but if it's explained clearly, it might attract investors looking to learn more. However, there are some stocks mentioned like TSLA (TECH), TXV (TRADERS VISION), XLR (EXPLORER), XNRG (XNGR), NKE (NEE), and DA (DA). The mention of a YouTube video on financial concepts could be seen as an educational tool, so positive sentiment.

5. ""$ goog active , relative volume : 4.6 , 1h , 9:00 am , nasdaq $ ndx $ spy""
   - The word ""active"" is used, suggesting the stock is performing well. Relative volume and time frames (nasdaq and spy) indicate increasing interest, which is positive news.
   
6. ""google inc . ( nasdaq : goog ) on watch URL $ goog""
   - This tweet highlights Google's continued presence in the market with an eye on growth. It suggests investor confidence, so positive sentiment.

Now, combining these analyses:
- The overall impact seems positive due to positive factors like management, education resources, and increasing activity."
2015-03-28,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price for a given company. The user provided three tweets and wants me to assess each based on positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

First, let's look at tweet 1: ""logging in now to live stock chat URL $ goog $ aapl $ fb $ ebay options stocks daytrading URL"". It seems like they're providing URLs for multiple stocks. No obvious positive or negative here; it's more about listing assets. So I'll mark this as [Neutral].

Next, tweet 2: ""URL <-- this ebook can take your stock trading to the next level ! awesome advice ! $ mbly $ aapl $ jcp $ tasr $ goog"". It mentions an ebook that provides strategies and strategies for trading stocks like goog, aapl, etc. This seems like positive information because it's offering useful content related to trading. So I'll mark this as [Positive].

Lastly, tweet 3: ""team up ! volvo says its open to $ goog , $ aapl partnerships . URL"". It talks about Volco partnering with others for goog and aapl stocks. Again, this is providing information on potential partnerships or collaborations in the tech sector, which can positively influence investor sentiment by indicating growth opportunities. So I'll classify this as [Positive].

Now, combining these three tweets: The first doesn't add anything positive or negative. The second provides positive advice and info, and the third also talks about partnerships that could be beneficial. Overall, there's a mix of positive information but no significant negative content. Therefore, the overall sentiment is positive."
2015-03-29,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze the given tweets for their impact on the stock price of an assumed company. The user provided three tweets and wants a summary conclusion. 

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at each tweet:

1. It mentions an ebook about stock trading strategies.
2. It discusses why $FB is hammering $GOOGL for Android ads on an Android phone.
3. It talks about NiftyCNX analysis and stocks like CNX, Awa, and TWTR.

Since the target stock isn't specified in any of these tweets, I'm a bit confused. Maybe each tweet refers to different companies? Let me check again:

1. The first tweet mentions $MBLY which could be a company, maybe Microsoft?
2. The second one is about FB (Facebook), as it's the subject and also mentioned ""ad cpcs"" which might relate to Facebook ads.
3. The third tweet discusses CNX, which I know is an index, but not a stock.

Wait, maybe each tweet refers to different stocks? For example:

-Tweet 1: Microsoft
-Tweet 2: Facebook
-Tweet 3: CNX

But the user didn't specify if it's about one company or multiple. Since all tweets are separate, I need to consider them as individual statements.

Now, for each tweet, I'll identify Positive and Negative factors:

1. Tweet 1 mentions an ebook that talks about stock trading strategies. This could be a positive factor like educational content or insights.
2. Tweet 2 discusses Facebook ads on an Android phone. This is negative because it suggests Facebook is gaining traction via ads, which might be seen as bad for others who prefer free platforms but not necessarily good for everyone.
3.Tweet 3 talks about stock market analysis (CNX), but since CNX isn't a stock, maybe it's unrelated or just an index.

Next, assess the sentiment of each tweet. Positive tweets encourage trading strategies, while negative ones point towards Facebook ads being bad.

However, without knowing which stock the user is referring to and how these tweets affect that specific stock, I can only make educated guesses based on what's in there. For example:

- If it's about Microsoft (Tweet 1), a positive tweet could positively influence investor sentiment.
- If it's about Facebook (Tweet 2), negative because ads are bad for others.

Without knowing the target stock and its relation to these tweets, I can't determine if the overall impact is positive or negative. So maybe I should state that without more context it's hard to conclude.

Alternatively, perhaps each tweet is about different companies, but since all are given without a specific target, my analysis might be incomplete. I'll proceed by noting the potential factors and their implications for each possible stock mentioned."
2015-03-30,Negative,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on a given company's stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the tweets provided:

1. The first tweet mentions ""AT_USER scalpel ! google moves into robotics surgery URL robotics healthcare investing $ jnj$..."" So it seems like the company is referred to as AT_USER.
2. The second tweet has ""$ goog : us at google, the science of working better google inc URL nasdaq"" This clearly refers to Google Inc.
3. The third tweet lists several stocks: $ tlt $ tna $ qqq $ spy $ gpro $ goog $ aapl URL. These are TLT, TNA, QQQ, SPY, GPRO,goog, and APLX. TLT is known for its dividend-yielding properties.
4. The fourth tweet lists more companies: $ eqix $ amzn $ msft $ aapl $ fb $ dlr $ dft $ goog … URL. This includes Equinex, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, DLR, DFT, and Google.
5. The fifth tweet says ""$ goog - key senator to take closer look at ftc-google meetings URL"" So focusing on Google's Future Technology Congress (FTC).
6. The sixth tweet has ""$ goog $ pcln $ twtr $ fb $ aapl $ ebay $ gm $ dust $ baba URL URL"" referring to Alphabet Inc., PCE, Twtr, FB, APLX, ebay, GM, and DBA.
7. The seventh tweet mentions: ""learn stock technical analysis and charting . URL $ aapl $ goog $ jrjc $ live $ intc $ twtr"" focusing on Apple Inc. and Google.
8. The eighth tweet says ""$ goog will google inc . pair android wear with apple inc . & 39 ; s iphones ? URL"". This seems like an investment idea, specifically pairing Android Wearable devices with Apple iPhones.

Now, the user wants me to analyze each tweet's impact on a stock symbol. However, looking at all these tweets, I don't have information about which company I'm tracking or its performance relative to it. Each tweet is talking about different companies and their related topics without any mention of stock data or specific news affecting a particular stock.

Since the target stock isn't identified, I can't analyze the sentiment based on the provided tweets alone. Without knowing what the stock symbol is or if there's any company-wide information from these tweets, it's impossible to determine whether they are positive, neutral, or negative regarding that stock.

So, as a result, I need to conclude that I cannot provide an accurate overall sentiment without more context—specifically, identifying which stock and understanding how the provided tweets affect its performance."
2015-03-31,Negative,"Okay, I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a given company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'm looking at the target stock symbol that's mentioned in the tweets. The first tweet mentions ""pcln"" which stands for Phenomenon Capitalization, so I think the stock could be Phenomenon Capitalization. 

Now, let's look at each relevant tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet talks about some technical terms like sentiquant and mentions dates, times, URLs. It doesn't seem to provide any direct information about the stock, just some unrelated content. So probably no impact from this tweet.

2. The second tweet says that Google Inc should fear Facebook Inc with dollar signs for multiple companies. This seems like a warning about increased competition between tech giants. But I'm not sure how much that affects individual stocks—maybe the overall market is up, but each company's performance could be influenced by others. Hmm, not sure if this is positive or negative.

3. The third tweet also mentions sentiquant and dates again. Similar to the first one; no direct information on the stock. So probably nothing here either.

4. The fourth tweet discusses AT_USER getting some internet-related news before Google Fiber reaches areas. This could be seen as a competitor's move, possibly reducing competition. But how significant is this? It might influence investor sentiment negatively if competitors are being told not to compete as hard as they used to be.

5. The fifth tweet lists various tech companies like Amzn, Baba, Bidu, etc., all related to Google. This seems like a list of unrelated information. Nothing specific about any stock here.

Putting it all together: Only the fourth tweet provides some info, but I don't have enough context to determine if that's positive or negative for Phenomenon Capitalization. The other tweets don't directly relate to the stock price."
2015-04-01,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company based on the given analysis guidelines.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. It seems like some tweets mention ""goog,"" so I think ""GOOG"" is the likely target stock.

Next, for each tweet, I'll separate them into positive and negative factors. Positive factors might include technical improvements, increased market share, or successful product launches, while negative factors could be regulatory changes, reduced competition, or declining interest in certain services like domain registration.

Looking at the tweets:

1. The first tweet is about GOOG moving into $ goog after projects were killed, possibly spun-off or licensed.
2. The second mentions that mobile projects get two years to prove themselves at Google with a URL launch.
3. Third tweet talks about Google launching new Chromebooks andsticks.
4. Fourth tweet offers trading info for users without needing a login.
5. Fifth tweet notes that Android is adding to the mobile market share in March as iOS recedes.
6. Sixth tweet mentions PCLN gaining some good news about all green days, intending to relax until Friday.
7. Tweet 7 discusses Google's R&D efforts and their URL.

Now, for each positive factor: The launch of new products (3), offering trading info (4), market expansion (5), competitive advantage (7).

Negative factors: Loss of interest in domain registrar business (1), potential dilution from a spun-off or license (1). Maybe regulatory issues with visa demands affecting opportunities.

The overall sentiment is the sum of positive and negative. Positive tweets like 3, 4, 5 contribute positively. Negative ones like 1 and 7 are mixed but leaning towards potential dilution. However, other factors like mobile expansion in 5 might indicate growth potential despite dilution.

Considering all this, it's a mix of possible dilution from spun-offs or licensing issues. The positive tweets point to new opportunities, but negative factors reduce confidence. There's some uncertainty about Google's long-term strategy due to domain registrar changes and competitive challenges.

I think the overall sentiment is Neutral because while there are signs of growth potential, concerns remain about dilution, regulatory risks, and competitive challenges. Investors might be cautious without clear direction."
2015-04-02,Negative,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about $ goog and see what they say about its stock price impact. So, first, I need to look at each tweet individually and see if there's any positive or negative information.

Starting with the first tweet: ""$ goog - eu lays grounds for antitrust charges against google URL."" Hmm, it says Google is laying groundwork for antitrust charges against Eu. That sounds like a serious news event because antitrust laws are crucial for protecting competition. If that happens, investors probably expect some impact on the stock price, maybe a positive one if they expect Google to face consequences.

The second tweet: ""$ goog URL samsung galaxy conquers android : what happened to the competition ? URL."" This one is more about Samsung conquering Android, which affects Samsung's market share and possibly their profits. That could be seen as a negative factor because it might reduce competition and therefore lower prices for consumers, which can hurt profits.

The third tweet: ""rt $ qqq algos triggered buy in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 08:43 , p / t 105.70 $ goog $ baba $ bidu $ gpro $ nflx $ ts … URL."" I'm a bit confused here. It mentions triggering buys on several companies and includes some stock symbols like QQQ, BABA, etc., which are unrelated to Google. The price movements go from p/t 105.70 to another price range. Maybe this is about Google's stock? If someone thinks buying other stocks could positively affect their own stock, that might be a bullish sign.

The fourth tweet: ""eu lays grounds for antitrust charges against google $ goog URL."" Similar to the first tweet, it's talking about antitrust charges. This reinforces the negative sentiment again because it's another potential impact on Google's stock price.

Lastly, the fifth tweet: ""$ goog - facebook inc . takes two more steps toward becoming youtube URL."" This is also about antitrust-like developments targeting Facebook, which could affect their operations and possibly their own stock performance if they face similar consequences.

Putting this all together. The first tweet is definitely negative because it's a serious legal event. The second tweet is also negative due to decreased competition. The third tweet seems related but has some unrelated stuff, so maybe that's neutral or slight negative. Then, the fourth and fifth tweets are like the first two but from Facebook, which might be less impactful than from other companies.

So overall, considering the main points of antitrust charges affecting both Google and possibly Facebook, there is a significant push towards negative sentiment for $ goog."
2015-04-03,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on stock prices for the given company. I'm not an expert in stock market analysis, but I'll do my best with the information provided.

First, looking at the target stock symbol from the tweet, it seems like ""goog"" is listed as a possible symbol. That makes sense because Google is a big tech company and often mentioned in finance contexts.

Now, let's go through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet says, ""$ 10 things in tech you need to know today $ goog $ gddy $ fb $ aapl URL bpulse tech"". So they're talking about important tech topics. I'm not sure what ""gddy"" stands for; maybe it's a typo? But the key points are tech trends and Google-related terms. Maybe this is positive because it's giving investors valuable information, which can influence their decisions to buy or sell.

2. The second tweet mentions ""URL <-- this ebook can take your stock trading to the next level ! awesome advice ! $ mbly $ aapl $ jcp $ tasr $ goog"". It seems like there's some content (ebook) being recommended. That could be positive because it might attract attention and influence investor sentiment towards the stock.

3. The third tweet is critical: ""actualizé google now y tengo un fondo blanco * horrible * . parece que $ goog nos quiere dejar ciegos . sale novalauncher"". Here, ""actualizé"" means to update or change something, which might imply Google's company needs attention. The mention of a bad feelings from some people is negative, and they're selling a product related to Google. This sounds like it could be negative because the investors are worried about things going wrong with their investments in Google.

4. The fourth tweet is ""rt AT_USER why 3dprinting stocks are ripe for m & a deals URL via AT_USER $ ssys $ ddd $ xone $ vjet $ onvo $ amzn $ goog $ msf …"". It's talking about M&A deals, which are deals between companies merging or acquiring each other. If there are lots of M&A deals happening around the time the tweet was made (2023), that could create a favorable environment for tech stocks because investors might be encouraged to buy higher-priced stocks when they're more likely to go public or be acquired.

Now, combining all these thoughts: The first tweet provides general tech info, which is positive. The second adds an interesting recommendation, so it's also positive. The third seems negative because of investor frustration and potential product issues with Google. The fourth mentions M&A deals, which can be a good signal for future growth.

However, the third tweet about Google having bad feelings could weigh in negatively. While the others are positive or neutral, the critical nature makes this tweet significant enough to have a negative impact on sentiment. But some people might still think it's not so bad because M&A deals are generally seen as good opportunities, especially for tech companies. 

Overall, it seems like there's a mix of positives and negatives. If I had to pick one overall, the third tweet is probably the most impactful and likely negative because it presents an unfavorable situation with possible issues."
2015-04-04,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for a given company. The user provided three tweets and wants me to conclude with ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"". 

First, looking at the target stock symbol in each tweet. It seems they're all related to tech companies since 'aapl', 'goog', 'msft' are stock symbols. But I don't know which one exactly.

Now, for each tweet:

1. The first tweet mentions true balls and multiple companies like $ aapl, $ goog, etc., but the sentiment isn't clear. It talks about the penny stock moving 801% in 6 weeks. That's a strong positive move, so maybe this tweet is positive.

2. The second tweet says ""penny stock pick on $ thcz ran up 801 % in 6 weeks ! big news : URL $ dpm $ frak $ goog"". It mentions an increase but doesn't specify the stock or exact company. This could be positive or neutral because it's just stating a fact without context.

3. The third tweet is about $ goog - Facebook might be a TV networks' biggest competitor. That's negative news for Google, so this one should be negative.

Putting it all together: two positive tweets and one negative. Since there's a mix of positive and negative, but mostly the negative tweet heavily influences sentiment. However, each tweet could have varying impacts depending on context. Maybe overall, the negative tweet is dominant, making the overall impact negative."
2015-04-05,Positive,"Alright, I need to determine how these tweets impact the stock price for a company. Let me break it down step by step.

First, each tweet has multiple factors. I should separate positive and negative ones. Positive factors might indicate growth potential or good news. Negative factors could be bad investment decisions or warnings about the company's performance.

Looking at tweet 1: It mentions various stocks but doesn't provide specific info on how they'll perform. So, it's neutral because there's no clear data to suggest a positive or negative outcome yet.

Tweet 2 talks about making money in trading and mentions Google and PCLN. The mention of making $600,00 is a strong positive signal for the stock price. But I should look at other factors too. It doesn't specify if it's beneficial or not, but the potential for gains makes me lean towards positive.

Tweet 3 provides information on options trading and mentions companies like Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, etc. While it's useful, it doesn't provide specific reasons or evidence of how these stocks will perform. So, I think it's neutral because it's offering value but not directly telling us if the stock is going up.

Tweet 4 talks about trading stocks and mentions Google and Apple with buy/sell signals for Monday. This could be a positive sign for Monday, but again, without specifics on how well that day will perform, it's uncertain. So, I'm leaning towards neutral here because there's some potential, but not enough info to confirm.

Tweet 5 gives advice about an ebook and mentions Google and JCP. It's encouraging and could boost the stock price positively. But like other tweets, it doesn't provide any concrete data or predictions, so it seems neutral.

In summary, tweet 1 is neutral because it's too vague. Tweets 2 and 4 have strong positive points about potential gains, while 3 is neutral with value info without specifics. So overall, the sentiment leans towards positive."
2015-04-06,Negative,"Okay, I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine if they'll impact the stock price of a given company. Let's break down each tweet.

First tweet: It mentions ACT as an active user on BOCHE, which is a stock. The words ""actives"" might indicate investor interest, but without specific details about actions like buying or selling, it's hard to tell if this has a positive or negative impact yet.

Second tweet talks about TWTR and GOOG being together, with the word + ""yorum"" meaning ""like."" Maybe this is about user engagement on social media. It could be positive as it reflects community building, but doesn't directly relate to stock performance.

Third tweet mentions TURKEY maintaining a block on YouTube over hostage crisis content and restoring access to Twitter. This seems like a negative sentiment because of the hostage crisis, which can disrupt operations or markets. The mention of restoring access might imply some investor concern about security, so this could be negative.

Fourth tweet says GOOG received an alert, likely causing a market reaction. Alerts from financial services companies often trigger investor reactions, so this is positive as it could lead to increased trading activity and stock price movements.

Fifth tweet suggests GOOG users circumvent government's restriction on Twitter in TURKEY by using internet access elsewhere. More privacy can sometimes boost stock prices because it might attract more investors or encourage competition. So this is a bit of both, but leaning positive due to potential new opportunities.

Sixth tweet mentions DMHI for long-term potential and talks about breaking out in the market. While this sounds positive with a clear outlook, it's speculative without concrete information on GOOG's performance. It might signal optimism but isn't definitive.

Seventh and eighth tweets mention Apple Maps integrating hotel reviews fromTripAdvisor. This could improve user experience by adding useful content to their navigation app. Positive because more features can attract users, leading to potential higher stock prices.

Now, summarizing each tweet's impact: The third tweet is definitely negative due to the hostage crisis. Fourth and fifth are positive as they trigger market reactions. Sixth is speculative but somewhat positive. Seventh/eighth are positive due to new features.

Considering all these factors, I think there might be a mix of positive and negative sentiments, but overall, the most significant negative point is the third tweet about Twitter access in Turkey facing a crisis. This could negatively impact GOOG's stock price because it affects their operations. However, the other tweets suggest potential positives from new features and user engagement."
2015-04-07,Neutral,"Alright, let me figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of the target company, which is Google.

First, I'll look at each tweet individually. I need to identify whether they're positive, negative, or neutral in sentiment towards Google. 

Starting with tweet 1: It asks about cashback profitability for credit card companies. That seems like a business-related question, not directly about the stock. So probably neutral.

Tweet 2 is quite long and mentions various stocks and factors, but it's more of a detailed analysis than a direct recommendation or critique. I don't see any positive or negative aspects here.

Tweet 3 talks about sentiment being -2 with a tweet featured on parse. This suggests some opinion but not clear about stock performance.

Tweet 4 is about pricing tiers for AT&T and T-Mobile, which are companies, not Google. So probably neutral.

 Tweet 5 discusses morning trends between Unilever and Edison International, no mention of Google, so likely neutral.

Tweet 6 from Google against an app it hates, with a percentage of people loving the app. While mentions of Google, but this tweet is more of a negative statement about their product.

Tweet 7 talks about market news on $GPT gains. Again, not directly related to Google, so neutral.

Tweet 8 discusses penny stocks and their performance over four months. This might indicate growth potential or issues with pricing, which could be positive or negative depending on the context. But since it's just a general statement, it's hard to judge.

Tweet 9 asks about voting power in $GPT. Not directly related to Google, so neutral.

Tweet 10 repeats tweet 9 without an answer. So probably neutral.

Tweet 11 is a market sentiment analysis for spy, Aapl, FB, etc., not Google-related.

Tweet 12 asks if AMX devices should expand into Chromebooks. This seems like a strategic question but doesn't provide specific information about the stock performance.

Lastly, tweet 13 mentions that $Thcz is one of the best penny stocks with gains over two months, which could be positive news for some companies, including Google. But it's not directly related to their stock price.

Putting this all together, most tweets are neutral regarding Google. Only a few discuss general market trends or negative statements about their products. So overall sentiment seems neutral."
2015-04-08,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this analysis. So, I need to determine whether these tweets will have a positive, neutral, or negative impact on the stock price of the target company. The user provided seven tweets and asked for an overall sentiment conclusion.

First, looking at each tweet individually might not be feasible because they are all in different languages and vary in content. But since the first tweet is in Arabic, I can start with that. It mentions $ sqm $ slw expecting to match growth history with $ fb $ goog $ cmcsa, which seems like a forward-looking announcement about potential investments or partnerships. That's generally positive because it shows intentionality.

The second tweet talks about $ finw gaining 438% in two days and is linked to penny stocks, blog updates. Penny stocks are often seen as undervalued, so this could be a signal of strong fundamentals. Positive sentiment likely here too.

Third tweet mentions $ goog, $ fb, $ yhoo selling石油 price targeting 1500% on Observe options, claiming they're close to getting it there in two days. High oil prices can affect the stock, especially if related companies like Google or Facebook are involved in oil production or consumption. This could be a short-term concern but might still have some positive impact if other factors balance out.

Fourth tweet is about waiting for Defender's Stargate milestone, with a user saying they're working on it and mention Google Maps Pacman. The user seems engaged, which suggests that the stock is being watched closely. However, engagement doesn't always mean positive stock movement; it could depend on broader market conditions or specific events.

Fifth tweet mentions Nasdaq 100 rolling out exits for $ goog short and covering a gain of 5% in two days. Short-term trading activity can indicate confidence in the stock's future performance but may also lead to price reactions based on news about other factors affecting Google.

Sixth tweet says Apple is a major snub boosting Google's revenue by billions, which could mean that while Apple's performance is negative for Google, it's not a huge factor. This might provide some support as an offsetting positive sentiment from the media coverage.

Seventh tweet talks about tickers trending on Twitter in last hour with $ goog $ twtr $ ndx. Twitter trends often reflect investor sentiment and market news, so this could show interest or expectations, but it's less direct and maybe more speculative.

Putting it all together, each tweet seems to have some positive elements, like forward-looking statements, potential investments, strong fundamentals, and engagement. However, they also include negative aspects such as high oil prices or short-term trading activity that might drive price movements. But overall, the presence of multiple positive signals suggests a generally positive impact."
2015-04-09,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets about a company's stock price impact and determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol from the first tweet: alibaba.com. So the focus is on Alibaba, which makes mobile ecommerce and search via user URLs like AT_USER $ baba $ bidu $ goog $ aapl $ amzn $ ebay URL. That's pretty specific, so each tweet is targeting this company.

The second tweet mentions viacom's biggest problem costing them 750 million dollars in revenue. Viacom is known for their content consumption business, which aligns with Alibaba's mobile commerce and search efforts. This negative news suggests a potential decline in the stock because revenue losses can hurt investors. So this tweet has a Negative factor.

Third tweet talks about RT $ qqq trading at 10 billion points below f/v. That seems like significant price movement, but I'm not sure how that affects the overall sentiment of the company's stock. Maybe it's just a minor correction? Not sure yet, maybe it's a micro event and could be seen as neutral.

Fourth tweet discusses M&G payments helping Facebook and other payments from Visa & MA with investor sentiment boosting them, while also benefiting JPM and Aapl. This is positive because the company is expanding into new revenue streams and has strong financial performance. So this tweet adds to the Positive sentiment towards the stock.

Fifth tweet mentions investors updating their opinions on April 9th about ERSX, which seems unrelated to Alibaba. It doesn't impact the stock price much, so probably just a minor update without significant news.

Now, combining all these factors: there's a big revenue loss from Viacom (Negative), significant price movements but maybe not affecting the company directly (Neutral?), and positive cash flows and expansion (Positive). The biggest negative factor is 750 million in revenue, which could be a major pull down. I'm leaning towards overall Negative because of that large loss, even though there are positive developments elsewhere."
2015-04-10,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about $ goog and how they might impact stock prices for In tune inc. 

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Both seem to mention ""invo,"" so I think that's the symbol. So it's probably In tune Inc.

Next, for each tweet, I'll break them down into Positive and Negative factors. For the first tweet: ""inuvo up 140 % + , what now ? ! whats next ? ! URL $ goog $ googl $ inuv $ yhoo."" It seems like it's talking about $ goog and $ inuv. So, positive factors could be things like $ goog being strong (like a rising stock) or $ inuv (maybe some product launch). The negative part might be the confusing URL with lots of money symbols—could imply uncertainty or lack of clarity.

The second tweet: ""$ goog - intel and google sticks unlikely to revolutionize computing URL."" This one is negative. It mentions that investing in Intel or Google won't change computing, which could impact their company's performance. So that seems like a strong negative factor for $ goog.

Now, assessing sentiment. The first tweet has conflicting factors—some positive, some negative. But the user is confused and is looking forward. Maybe they're unsure about where to go next, so there's uncertainty.

The second tweet is more definitive—it states that investing in Intel or Google won't revolutionize computing. That seems pretty strong negative because it's making a clear statement about future trends. People are probably seeing this as a hint that $ goog might not be affected much.

Combining both tweets: The user has doubts and uncertainty (from the first tweet) but then clearly states that investing in those companies won't help with computing. This is pretty discouraging.

Overall, there's some ambiguity from the first tweet but strong negative factors highlighted by the second one. Maybe people are unsure about $ goog now but feel it might be safe because of this clear message. Or perhaps they're concerned about other areas that might impact $ goog. 

Wait, hold on—both tweets mention $ goog. So maybe all their attention is tied to $ goog? That could affect investor sentiment more. If the user is confused and looking ahead, but the underlying message from the second tweet is strong negative for $ goog, overall sentiment might lean Negative because despite some uncertainty, clear evidence is given that $ goog isn't likely affected.

I think I should consider if all tweets are about $ goog. The first one seems to mention $ goog, but in a confused way with lots of symbols. Maybe it's also related to $ inuv or something else. But the second tweet clearly refers to $ goog. So perhaps both tweets are pointing towards $ goog, making the sentiment more Negative because of the clear statement.

So overall sentiment would be Negative since there's strong negative factors and some uncertainty from a positive point."
2015-04-11,Neutral,"Alright, let me break down how I approached this problem step by step.

First, I identified the target stock from each tweet. It seems like all tweets are related to the Google stock symbol ($ goog ), so that's straightforward.

Next, for each tweet, I separated Positive and Negative factors. However, looking at the provided tweets, none of them explicitly mention any positive or negative factors directly. Some have URLs indicating technical terms or company mentions, but nothing stands out as definitely positive or negative in terms of stock performance.

Then, I evaluated how each tweet might influence investor sentiment. All tweets are about Google's stock and its competitors. They all seem to present information that could be seen as supportive of the stock, maybe even encouraging investors to stay focused on the company without implying any particular outcome beyond that support.

I considered the possibility of technical issues with the links or URLs, which might suggest something is wrong, but since the tweets are more about discussing the stock and its competitors rather than predicting their performance, I don't think those issues directly affect the stock's future price.

After analyzing each tweet without any clear positive or negative indicators, I concluded that there's no strong evidence suggesting a positive, neutral, or negative trend in these tweets. They all seem to present a general optimism about Google and its competitors."
2015-04-12,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the tweets:

1. The first tweet mentions ""this millionaire maker for traders shares his secrets."" The word ""traders"" might indicate that it's related to tech or finance companies, possibly Apple (AAPL) since Apple is a major tech company.

2. The second tweet refers to $ goog, which is Google's stock price.

3. The third tweet mentions technical analysis and charting for stocks like ABL, APL, JNJ, INTC, and TWTR. These are all financials but not directly related to the first two tweets.

4. The fourth tweet talks about penny stocks on $ thcz, which doesn't ring a bell with the other topics mentioned in the tweets.

Now, I'll separate each tweet into positive and negative factors.

1. ""this millionaire maker for traders shares his secrets"" could be positive because it's intriguing and shows the author has some knowledge or interest in trading. So this is a Positive factor.

2. ""$ goog"" is Google, a well-known company with significant market presence. The tweet says the stock price gained over 800%, which is a strong positive indicator of success. So this is a Positive factor.

3. ""rt AT_USER learn stock technical analysis and charting."" Technical analysis has a positive connotation because it's educational and could help investors make informed decisions, leading to better stock performance. This is a Positive factor.

4. The mention of penny stocks on $ thcz doesn't seem relevant. Penny stocks are typically those trading for just a few dollars, but the tweet doesn't specify what company or what happened with the stock. There's no clear positive or negative implication here. It could be considered Neutral because it's unclear how this relates to the other topics discussed.

Next, I'll assess the sentiment of each tweet individually:

1. ""this millionaire maker for traders shares his secrets"" — Positive because the content is intriguing and shows value.
2. ""$ goog"" – Google is a well-known tech company with a strong market presence, so a 800% gain is very positive.
3. ""learn technical analysis and charting."" Technical analysis is valuable knowledge for investors, which can enhance performance, hence Positive.
4. The tweet about penny stocks on $ thcz doesn't provide any information relevant to the previous topics discussed, making it Neutral.

Now, combining these factors, the tweet about penny stocks seems like a negative because it's unrelated to the other discussions and could have little impact on the overall stock price. However, I need to consider if there are any hidden implications. Since there's no mention of any benefits or negatives related to those topics, it's probably neutral.

Wait, but I think the initial assessment was correct. The tweet about penny stocks is neutral because there's no positive information provided that could suggest improvement or decline. It’s just a statement without context."
2015-04-13,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out the stock market impact based on these tweets about Apple's future. First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking through the tweets, it seems like ""AAPL"" is consistently mentioned in some of them.

Now, for each tweet that mentions ""AAPL,"" I should analyze the factors and sentiment. The first 10 tweets are all about predictions that Apple will gain one $ on Google's stock value this year. These tweets are repeated ten times, so that suggests a lot of investor interest or confidence in Apple's future performance.

The next set of tweets starts with ""rt AT_USER"" followed by phrases like ""option millionaires: jimmybob : $ scty announcements..."" and then the prediction about Nest Labs partnering with Google. So, these are predictions from individual users, possibly analysts or investors, that mention a potential partnership between Nest Labs and Google.

Looking at the first 10 tweets related to Google, they all state that Apple will gain one dollar on Google's stock value this year. This indicates strong optimism about Apple's growth potential relative to Google. Investors are likely eager to see how Apple's products or services compete with Google's in the future.

Then there are some other tweets starting with ""rt AT_USER"" but these seem more varied and don't directly relate to Google. For example, some mention JimmyBob or option millionaires, which might be different people or unrelated companies. The main focus is on Apple gaining value on Google.

There's also a tweet that starts with ""option millionaires: jimmybob : $ scty announcements..."" but that seems like it could relate to Nest Labs and their partnership with Google, similar to the earlier predictions.

Considering all this, the main drivers here are positive sentiment from analysts predicting Apple gains one dollar on Google. These sentiments are likely reflected in investor confidence and stock prices. Even though some tweets mention other companies or unrelated topics (like JimmyBob), they seem out of context for the main focus on Apple's performance against Google.

Therefore, despite there being other factors mentioned elsewhere, the primary sentiment is positive from Apple's potential future gains relative to Google."
2015-04-14,Neutral,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price of a company. The user wants me to analyze each tweet and determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative in impact on the stock. Let me go through each one step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at tweet 1: ""want to make $600,000 in one year trading ? check out how this guy did it ! $ goog $ pcln $ vtae"". It seems like they're talking about making money in trading. The key word here is 'making money,' so I think the stock in question might begoog.

Next, for tweet 2: "" $ bac financials updated tuesday , april 14 , 2015 07:11 : 18 am $ goog $ xle $ jnj $ adus URL"". This mentions financials and updates on April 14th. 'Financials' is a general term, so it's ambiguous who the company is here. It could be any company listed on the stock market.

Tweet 3: ""google's slow-motion strangulation URL $ goog google $ googl"". The mention of Google sounds familiar. Maybe this tweet is about Google's stock? Or perhaps it's a typo or irrelevant information.

Tweet 4: ""$ goog - 3 reasons google inc . shouldn't acquire twitter inc . URL"". Here, the user lists reasons why they don't want to acquire Twitter Inc., which is a competitor of Google. This could indicate their position on acquiring competitors and might have some impact on stock prices if it's seen as good for diversification or strategic reasons.

Tweet 5: ""$ goog - 3 reasons google inc . fears URL inc . URL"". Similar structure, listing reasons why they're worried about acquiring Twitter Inc. Again, this seems like internal info rather than external news that could affect the stock directly.

Now, tweet 6 is a list of major indices and URLs: "" $ vix $ usd major indices $ goog $ pcln $ twtr $ fb $ aapl $ ebay $ gm $ dust $ baba URL URL"". This looks like an update or announcement about some major financial indices. Major indices can influence stock prices because they're part of the broader market, but without knowing which company is being referred to here, it's hard to say.

To assess impact on the stock price, I need to see if these tweets provide any news related to the target company, which from tweet 1 seems to be goog. If the other tweets are about general topics or unrelated companies, they might not directly affect goog's stock unless the indices mentioned change significantly.

Looking at each tweet: 
- Tweets that specifically mention goog will likely influence the stock positively if they provide good news.
- External news like financial updates (tweets 2 and 6) can have a significant impact depending on what it is about.
- Internal discussions or reasons to avoid acquiring competitors (tweets 4 and 5) don't directly affect the stock unless there's speculation about their valuation.

Since I don't know which company the user refers to, but based on tweet 1, goog seems relevant. However, tweets 2 and 6 are more general financial news which might not specifically target goog. The others are internal info which is less likely to influence the stock price unless there's speculation about their performance.

I'm leaning towards a neutral or slightly positive sentiment because while there's some general info affecting different sectors, it's probably overshadowed by the specific tweet from Google that could have positive implications. But considering the other tweets don't directly relate to goog, maybe the overall impact is minimal.

But wait, if these are all from the same user, perhaps they're suggesting that this is a good sign for goog, so even though it's general, it might be seen as positive. So I should lean towards neutral because while there are some relevant points, the tweets aren't specific to goog."
2015-04-15,Neutral,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a given company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. It seems like some tweets mention things like ""thcz"" or ""trz"", which I recognize as abbreviations for ""Tata Computers Limited"". So, the target stock is Tata Computers Limited (TCL).

Now, for each tweet, I'll separate them into positive and negative factors based on what's mentioned. Then I'll assess the sentiment and combine it all to get an overall sentiment.

1. The first tweet says something about the Dow closing down tomorrow, listing URLs. It seems neutral because it's providing info rather than making a prediction.
2. Second tweet talks about Facebook (FA) and Google (GOOG), mentioning health, email marketing. While positive points are made, there are also negative elements like Facebook's financial issues, so sentiment is mixed but leaning towards negative.
3. Third tweet is about Google (GURL) talking to family about money and aging. This seems neutral since it's speculative.
4. Fourth tweet mentions a stock pick from ThC that went up 494% based on initial release. The factors here include positive aspects like customer reviews, but the sentiment isn't clear yet.
5. Fifth tweet offers a free video tutorial for trading. It might make people feel safer and more confident, which could be positive.
6. Sixth tweet is about Google filing antitrust charges against another company. This is definitely negative because it affects Google's reputation.
7. Seventh tweet talks about the Fed meeting with Edgemoor, discussing Google and Johnson Controls. Negative factors like economic issues.
8. Eighth tweet from a user mentions a bearish ""shark"" pattern in the stock, indicating potential for loss. That's a strong negative.
9. Ninth tweet offers free video tutorials on several stocks. Positive sentiment for trading advice.
10. Tenth tweet says Google will use advertisers' emails to target ads. This could be positive for users but might also depend on competitors.
11. Eleventh tweet talks about members picking up their penny stocks, which went up 1600% in four months. Positive action leading to gains.
12. Twelfth tweet breaks about Europe accusing Google of antitrust violations. More negative info than positive.
13. Thirteenth tweet is a repeat of the same as number twelve.
14. Fourteenth tweet talks about live stock chat with several stocks. Neutral information without a clear direction.
15. Fifteenth tweet offers a penny alert on NVIDIA (NVDA) and Google, suggesting gains. This has both positive and negative elements depending on NVIDIA's performance.
16. Sixteenth tweet mentions another bank (BBB) that saw similar stock growth as TCL. Positive point but not directly about the stock.
17. Seventeenth tweet introduces another player (IBM), which is a tech company, suggesting potential gains or losses.

Now, I need to sum up these factors. There are both positive and negative tweets contributing to the overall sentiment. Some tweets like the ones from Google using advertisers and NVIDIA's stock being mentioned can have mixed effects. The overall sentiment seems to be a mix of positive actions and some negative ones about competitors and regulations. However, the positive action on NVIDIA is significant enough that it might outweigh the negatives.

So, I think the overall sentiment should be neutral because there are conflicting factors, but leaning towards positive due to the significant stock picks and trading advice."
2015-04-16,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the company. So, I'm given eight tweets about $ goog and some other stocks, and I need to analyze them to decide if it's positive, neutral, or negative for $ goog.

First, looking at tweet 1: It says AT_USER $ goog can put you out of business by dropping you 3 spots in search. That seems pretty serious, like a warning or a cautionary statement. People are warning others that the stock might drop a lot, so this probably has some negative impact on the overall market.

Tweet 2 is a retweet of tweet 1, and it mentions jawbone putting a mobile payments band into an up4 fitness band URL. I don't have much context about jawbone or that specific product right now, but this seems like it's providing information or maybe just adding more details without strong sentiment. So maybe not too significant.

Tweet 3 says $ goog big data is looming as the next battle in Europe. This sounds like a cautionary note about something critical—big data being important in Europe. It could affect the stock, but I'm not sure how urgent it seems. Maybe neutral because unless more information comes out, it's speculative.

Tweet 4 mentions that europe has antitrust chief making a case for Google charging. Antitrust deals can sometimes set price wars or protect competition, which might impact the company's revenue and stock value. So this could add some negative sentiment, but I'm not certain if it's strong enough to outweigh tweet 1.

Tweet 5 talks about learning technical analysis and charting with specific URLs. This seems like a practical tip for someone looking to analyze stocks. It's more of a guide or instruction rather than a warning, so maybe it doesn't have a significant impact on the stock price.

Tweet 6 is another retweet but suggests stopping Twitter to use the new $ twtr homepage and going to duckduckgo instead of $ goog. This seems like a personal statement from someone advising others to avoid $ goog. It could be seen as a cautionary tip, so this might have some negative impact on the stock.

Tweet 7 mentions paying higher spreads for tech giants due to market uncertainty. Tech companies often have stable growth and investors prefer safer options, but if there's uncertainty or competition from others, that could affect their performance. This is another warning note, likely contributing to a negative sentiment.

Tweet 8 talks about comparing market capitalization of $ aapl and $ goog with $ googl, which is a fintech company. Market capitalization is the total value of stock held by investors. If fintech companies are in the news or have positive developments, that could influence investor confidence. However, without knowing if these stocks are up or down, it's hard to say. Maybe a neutral response.

Putting this all together: Tweets 1 and 6 are more about serious warnings with potential drops or negative advice. Tweet 7 is also a warning but about spreads, which might not have the same immediate impact. The rest seem less impactful. So overall, considering the most urgent warnings from tweets 1 and 7, it's likely negative."
2015-04-17,Positive,"Alright, so I need to analyze these tweets about Google's stock and determine whether they're positive, neutral, or negative in impact on the stock price. Let me start by breaking down each tweet one by one.

First, looking at tweet 1: ""google embraces ' mobile-friendly ’ sites in yet another search shake-up URL tech $ goog $ googl."" Hmm, this seems like Google is focusing more on mobile-friendly sites as part of their search shake-up. I know that Google has always been a leader in mobile, but this specifically mentions the emphasis on improving the responsiveness and accessibility of their sites. This could potentially attract more users, which might improve revenue. So, positive factors here.

Next, tweet 2: ""$ goog reverse c & h."" Reverse C and H? Wait, I'm not sure what that means. The symbols are lowercase, so maybe ""reverse C & H"" refers to a stock ticker or something else. If it's about the company's management or financials, but without more context, it's hard to say. It could be positive if it's good news, but since I don't have specifics, it's ambiguous.

Tweet 3: ""rt AT_USER free video tutorial psychology of trading URL $ tlt $ tna $ qqq $ spy $ gpro $ goog $ aapl URL."" This one is about a free video tutorial on the psychology of trading. While this could influence investor sentiment positively by providing educational content, it's also related to Google. If the tutorials are helpful and relevant, they might increase stock price. But if the user is promoting something that's not positive, it could be conflicting.

Tweet 4: ""rt AT_USER $ goog online stock traders get their trading information here - no login required - URL."" Traders can access info without a login. This would mean more people are accessing Google for trading purposes. Without more details on the content or benefits, it's hard to assess the impact directly. It might be neutral since it's just about providing information.

Tweet 5: ""rt AT_USER $ goog $ aapl $ twtr shorter and sweeter - update from option millionaires - stock options chatroom earlier this week ... http …"" This tweet is updating on stock options, mentioning something related to millionaires and chatrooms. It seems like an update that might be positive if it's about improving trading strategies or products. But without specifics on how Google has performed based on this, I can't say for sure.

Tweet 6: ""rt AT_USER what is at the heart of the eu's antitrust complaint against google ? search bias . URL $ goog."" This one is asking about an antitrust complaint regarding Google and search bias. Antitrust deals with competition, so if Google faced such a complaint, it could lead to legal actions, which might affect their stock price negatively. However, without knowing how this relates to the user's trading strategies or products, it's speculative.

Now, summarizing each tweet:

1. Positive: Focusing on mobile sites.
2. Ambiguous: Not much info.
3. Neutral: Educational video but related to Google.
4. Neutral: Trading information without login.
5. Positive: Update on stock options.
6. Neutral: Antitrust complaint.

Since some tweets are ambiguous and others are positive, the overall sentiment is a mix of positive elements like mobile sites and stock options updates, with some less certain or negative aspects. However, if I prioritize the most impactful positive points (tweets 1 and 5), they lean towards a positive trend. The other tweets have mixed signals.

In the end, it's hard to say for sure because there are both supportive and conflicting factors. But given that Google is a major player and has been in the mobile space, I might lean slightly positive overall."
2015-04-18,Negative,"Okay, so I have to analyze these tweets and figure out if they're positive, neutral, or negative for a stock's future price. Let me start by understanding what each tweet is saying.

The first tweet says $ goog URL is brazil's ' lava jato ' money hiding in Miami. Hmm, that sounds like Google's URL might be a red flag or maybe some kind of joke. I'm not sure if this affects the company or not. It seems a bit odd and possibly speculative, but it could be seen as manipulating their stock price.

The second tweet lists several stocks: google, aapl, fb, ebay options, daytrading. This looks like a list of stocks to buy, so it's positive because they're promoting Google and other tech companies that might increase the overall market.

Third tweet is from investors selling shares after an insider sold on Google, $ goog URL. This clearly shows strong negative sentiment towards Google's stock due to insider trading. Investors are worried about earnings or future performance, which could lead to a decline in stock price.

Fourth tweet gives some percentage changes for several stocks over the last ytd: Amzn up 21%, Apx up 13%, FB up 3.54%, QQQ up 2.67%, CS Co down 0.36%, Intc and Inc down 10.53%. This is a mix of positive and negative changes, but the overall trend seems mixed. While some stocks are doing well, others like CS Co and Inc are dropping significantly. This could indicate uncertainty about future performance or economic factors.

Now, putting it all together: The first tweet's speculative nature might either enhance or reduce the stock's value, depending on the context. The second is promoting the company, which should be positive. The third shows strong negative sentiment from investors. The fourth has mixed trends but some up, some down.

So overall, combining positive (promoting Google) with negative factors like insider selling and fluctuating performance could lead to a mixed effect. However, since investors are selling shares, it's clear that the market is bearish. But whether this outweighs the positive tweets about other companies isn't clear yet. It might be too early to tell, but there's some risk involved."
2015-04-19,Neutral,"Alright, I need to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of ""GOOG"". Let's start by analyzing each tweet one by one.

First tweet: It mentions that GOOG is spending more on advanced robotics and Uber. This could indicate growth in investments or technology-focused companies, which might positively affect the stock. So, I'll mark this as positive.

Second tweet talks about investing in smartwatches with a URL. Smartwatches are an booming industry, so suggesting it's one of the best stocks for smartwatches sounds promising. Definitely positive sentiment here.

Third tweet mentions that妈妈 Jones proved once and for all that minimum wage destroys jobs. Minimum wage is a significant economic issue that can hurt companies. This tweet is pointing out a negative impact on GOOG by emphasizing job losses, which could hurt profits. So this tweet contributes to a negative sentiment towards GOOG.

Now, combining these factors: two tweets are positive (investing in smartwatches and growth in robotics), but one tweet is negative (minimum wage affecting jobs). It's hard to say for sure because while some positive points might have mitigated the negatives, there are still significant concerns about employment. The overall impact seems mixed, so I'll consider it neutral."
2015-04-20,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. The target stock symbol isn't given, but looking at the tweets, it seems like they all mention ""goog."" That makes me think the target stock is Google.

Let me go through each tweet one by one and analyze their factors and sentiment.

1. **First tweet**: It mentions that true balls are giving $ on multiple stocks: aapl, goog, intc, etc., until expiration 04/17/2015. This seems like positive because it's providing value to investors. So this is definitely a positive factor.

2. **Second tweet**: ""rt AT_USER google may let advertisers use customer emails..."" This sounds like it could have a positive impact if Google's emails are valuable, which might help them target ads better. That would boost investor sentiment positively.

3. **Third tweet**: Talks about option expiration and open interest. High open interest usually means more volume and less trading activity, which can be seen as negative because it might indicate uncertainty or lack of confidence among investors. So this is a negative factor.

4. **Fourth tweet**: Earnings calendar from multiple companies like mlnx, cmg, cree, etc. If Google's earnings report is good, that could boost their stock price. However, without knowing the specific company (like Alphabet Inc.), it's hard to say if it's positive or not. But generally, good earnings reports are positive.

5. **Fifth tweet**: Asking for 10 things in tech you need to know today. This seems like a helpful and informative tweet that could attract more attention from investors. It might increase interest, which is positive for the stock price.

6. **Sixth tweet**: Suggesting Bing could be a real challenger to Google Inc. If there's any risk involved, it could affect investor sentiment. However, if the suggestion is based on some underlying reason, like potential competition, it might not have a strong impact.

7. **Seventh tweet**: ""Sell Google under siege"" via AT_USER, suggesting they are competing or in a tight spot. This can be seen as negative because selling stocks during a tough time usually hurts their stock price.

Now, compiling the factors and sentiment:

- Positive factors: 1st tweet (value to investors), second tweet (advertiser emails), fourth tweet (good earnings), fifth tweet (attracting info). So four positives.
- Negative factors: third tweet (high open interest), sixth tweet (potential challenge), seventh tweet (negative competition).

Out of seven tweets, the majority are positive. The negative factors don't outnumber the positives enough to make it neutral or negative overall.

So combining these, the stock sentiment is likely Positive because there's a strong push towards buying due to good news and helpful information."
2015-04-21,Neutral,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user provided some tweets and asked me to analyze their impact on the stock price of a company. They want the conclusion in one line with ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"".

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at the tweets, the first tweet mentions ""goog"" so I'm assuming it's Apple Inc., AAPL.

Next, for each tweet, I have to identify positive and negative factors. 

Looking at tweet 1: It says ""reverse en 1 corto de $ goog a 535.61 usd perdiendo -0.11 usd idop 208334 vía AT_USER URL"". The mention of losing USD is likely an indicator of concern or a significant event, which could be negative.

Tweet 2 starts with ""most active nasdaq-traded stocks : URL $ aapl $ goog $ pcln $ k"". This doesn't specify any positive or negative, so it's neutral.

Tweet 3 mentions that Google is changing how search works on their phone. This usually relates to the company itself, suggesting an update or new feature which can be positive if it enhances user experience and potentially leads to higher stock price, but I'm not sure about the impact yet.

Tweet 4 talks about a penny stock alert for $ oslh gaining 97% in 3 days. A penny stock is usually a company listed at $1, and an alert suggests good news or earnings, which would likely be positive.

Tweet 5 says ""$ goog active , relative volume : 2.28 , 1h , 2:00 pm , nasdaq $ spy $ ndx"". The mention of volume can indicate trading interest, but without context on price movement, it's hard to tell if it's positive or negative.

Tweet 6 mentions settling antitrust complaints for Google, which could be a major event that might negatively affect the stock price as competitors get attention.

Now, putting this together. There are multiple tweets suggesting changes (tweet 3) and news related to stock performance (tweets 4, 5, 6). While tweet 4 is positive, the others involve concerns about trading activity, volume, and significant events that could affect the stock price negatively. It's a mix of mixed signals.

I think overall sentiment might be a mix but leaning towards positive because Apple's upcoming changes in search could have benefits. However, the negative mentions like losing USD or antitrust issues add some uncertainty. But I'm not sure if those are enough to outweigh the positive factors."
2015-04-22,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about Google and their impact on the stock price. So, I see there are 14 tweets here. Each tweet is a separate event that could influence investor sentiment.

Starting with the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER google is set to unveil its new u . s . wireless service as early as wednesday URL $ goog URL."" That sounds like Google is planning something and will launch by Wednesday. I'm not sure what they're launching, but it's an important announcement. If Google is making a move in the wireless sector, that could be positive because it might open up new markets or services.

The second tweet repeats the same thing as the first one. It seems redundant, so probably just confirming the same information. Doesn't add much new.

Third tweet: ""$ goog $ googl $ s $ tmus : hi fi : google , sprint and t-mobile partner to launch wireless service : URL."" Again, Google is launching a partnership with Sprint and T Mobile. That's another opportunity for the stock to rise as it could bring in more customers or markets. The mention of hi-fi services suggests a mobile-centric approach, which might be attractive.

Fourth tweet: ""google is changing its search algorithm to favor sites that look good on smartphones rt AT_USER URL $ goog mobile."" This is about improving their search results based on smartphone-friendly content. That's a strategic change that could benefit both Google and the users, potentially boosting sales and increasing user engagement on their site.

Fifth tweet: ""toptickertweets $ spy $ aapl $ vltc $ fb $ enzn $ tsla $ mcd $ uso $ goog $ cmg sentiquant 2015042 2 16:00 : 13:746"" This is looking at some financials. They mention Google's stock, Apple, Vltc, FB, Enzn, TSLA, MCD, UO, and SPY. It seems like they're analyzing the performance of these stocks in relation to Google. If others are performing well relative to Google, it might indicate undervaluation or market analysis, which could affect investor sentiment.

Sixth tweet: ""rt AT_USER what to watch for in google's earnings - marketwatch URL google $ goog $ googl URL."" This is a call to action encouraging investors to check Google's earnings. It's a standard follow-up when a company does its financials, as it can show confidence and provide market updates which might influence their sentiment towards the stock.

Seventh tweet: ""rt AT_USER AT_USER $ goog google launches fi mobile service - $ 20 / month for voice / text , $ 10 per gb URL"" Here, they're giving details about the new mobile service. If it's a profitable product or adding value to their users, especially on a budget, this could be a strong point in favor of Google's stock.

Eighth tweet: ""cerrado 3 largos de $ goog a 538.13 usd ganando 0.24 usd idop 209903 vía AT_USER URL"" The closing price is mentioned, along with gains. This seems more like technical analysis or market trend indicators, which can influence stock prices based on expected future performance.

Ninth tweet: ""rt AT_USER google is set to unveil its new u . s . wireless service as early as wednesday URL $ goog URL"" Similar to the first two tweets. Confirming another big announcement about Google's wireless launch. This could open up new business opportunities or markets, which would be a positive signal.

Tenth tweet: ""rt AT_USER facebook's video views are exploding $ fb $ goog URL"" Facebook is increasing their video views through Google. As a competitor in the internet space, this could attract more users and increase revenue for both companies. This could lead to an increase in Google's stock price as it gains market share.

Eleventh tweet: ""businessinsider : facebook's video views are exploding $ fb $ goog URL"" Similar to the tenth one. Another tweet from a business insider highlighting Facebook's growth via Google. It's likely providing context or analysis on this growing trend, which might influence investor sentiment towards both companies.

Twelfth tweet: ""facebook's video views are exploding $ fb $ goog URL ( via twitter URL via b … URL"" Again, repeating the information from the eleventh. Not adding much new, just another confirmation.

Thirteenth tweet: ""google inc ( goog ) android smart screen lock new update adds geofence feature URL $ goog"" Google is updating its Android devices with a new feature related to geolocation. While this might be more technical and less directly related to the stock, it could improve user experience for their users, which can boost sales and indirectly affect the stock price.

Fourteenth tweet: ""rt AT_USER eye of the tiger , baby ! $ goog $ pcln $ twtr $ fb $ aapl $ ebay $ gm $ dust $ baba URL URL"" This is an enthusiastic tweet with mentions of multiple companies. It's more promotional and could indicate positive news about Google, which might boost its stock price.

Now, putting it all together. The tweets are all around Google's announcements or market analysis related to Google. They mention partnerships (like Sprint and T Mobile), a search algorithm change, earnings reports, new mobile services, Facebook growth, Android updates, and even some promotional tweets with multiple companies. All these factors point towards Google being in good financial shape and having strategic business opportunities that could benefit their customers.

Looking at the other companies mentioned—Sprint, T Mobile, Vltc (which is a telecommunications company), FB (Facebook), Enzn (not sure about this one), TSLA (Tesla), MCD (Microsoft), UO (Univarco), SPY (S&P 500 ETF). These are all established companies, and their performance could influence Google's stock price through market analysis or competitive positioning. Additionally, the fact that Google is launching new wireless services early suggests they might be expanding their offerings in a target market, which can drive demand.

Overall, the tweets seem to indicate strong positive sentiment from multiple angles—Google's strategic moves, market trends, and promotional activities—all of which should contribute positively to the stock price."
2015-04-23,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out how to determine if a given tweet is likely to impact the stock price positively, neutrally, or negatively for an company based on the provided information. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the task says that the user has already extracted the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet: ""your first ' green ' trade for thursday , april 23 : URL $ aapl $ goog $ pcln $ k"". Hmm, this one seems to be trading on Twitter. It mentions something about an 'Appl' stock because of the dollar symbol in their names. So I think the target stock is probably Apple Inc. (AAPL) since it's commonly known and has positive brand recognition.

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate Positive and Negative factors. But wait, this first tweet doesn't have any tweets listed, just one full sentence without numbers or specific keywords. So maybe I'm missing some information here. The other tweets are supposed to be analyzed individually, but the user didn't provide them. That's a problem because without each tweet, it's hard to assess all factors.

Wait, perhaps the original task was different. Maybe the tweet is part of a list of multiple tweets, and each one has its own content. But in this case, only one full tweet is provided. So maybe I should just use that as a single factor? Or does each relevant tweet have something else?

I'm confused because without multiple tweets, it's impossible to assess all the factors. Maybe the user missed providing them or didn't format it correctly.

But assuming that the first tweet is the only one given, perhaps I can consider it as the sole relevant tweet for this analysis? Or maybe there are several tweets, each with their own facts and sentiments. Without seeing each tweet, it's challenging to make a comprehensive assessment.

Wait, but in the provided context, there are multiple tweets listed. Let me check again: The user has given a list of tweets that all mention trading or stock symbols. Each tweet is separated by periods and includes stock names like ""aapl"", ""goog"", etc. So maybe each of these is a separate relevant tweet that I need to analyze.

So, in this case, the first tweet seems to be about trading on Apple, but without any information on factors (positive or negative), it's hard to assess its impact. The same goes for all the others.

But since only one full tweet is provided, maybe the user meant to include multiple tweets and didn't format them correctly. Alternatively, perhaps each line in the list of tweets needs to be analyzed separately.

Assuming that, I would need to go through each tweet individually. For each, identify positive factors like technical indicators or analyst ratings, negative factors like earnings, revenue growth, or competitive positioning. Then assess the overall sentiment based on how these factors stack up across all tweets.

However, since only one full line is provided, perhaps it's intended to be one relevant tweet for this analysis. But without more information about factors or emotions conveyed in that single tweet, it's impossible to determine its impact on stock price.

Wait, maybe the first tweet is just a placeholder and doesn't contain any positive or negative sentiments or specific factors. It might be a general trading mention without any additional context. In that case, it wouldn't provide enough information for a stock analysis.

In conclusion, since only one full tweet is provided without further details on factors or sentiment, it's challenging to determine the stock's impact. I would need more information about each relevant tweet in this list to perform an accurate assessment."
2015-04-24,Positive,"Okay, let's try to figure out how to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. So, first, I need to look at each tweet one by one and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral. Then, I'll assess how each tweet affects investor sentiment and overall market outlook.

Starting with tweet 1: ""$ goog active , relative volume : 3.83 , 1h , 5:00 pm , nasdaq $ spy $ ndx"". It mentions that $ goog is active, has high relative volume, and the time frame is next trading hour on Nasdaq. That seems like positive information because it's showing ongoing interest in Google, which might lead to more market activity.

Tweet 2: ""our winning penny stock picks gained over 3115 % in the past 6 months ! huge news : URL $ erbb $ bbda $ goog"". This tweet talks about significant gains from a stock and has a URL. It mentions that it's huge news, so I think this is positive because it highlights major developments, which would likely boost investor confidence.

Tweet 3: ""$ goog - URL lifts the nasdaq , after having smashed it URL"". This suggests that Google's price has caused the Nasdaq to rally. That seems like a strong positive indicator for the stock price since a substantial company often drives market indices up.

Tweet 4 and 5 mention AT_USER flirtying with large amounts of Google, with revenue losses attributed to a strong dollar. It's possible these tweets are related to stock performance but not directly about Google itself. The mention of the dollar losing ground could negatively impact the stock if the company is affected by currency fluctuations.

Tweet 6 repeats tweet 5's points without any additional information, so it's likely redundant and probably just repeating the same info from before.

Tweet 7: ""$ goog $ googl $ gild $ mcd all up , posted before market open URL"". This seems like a mix of stock names that are rising. If these companies are doing well and being mentioned in positive tweets about Google, it could be a good sign for their stock price.

Tweet 8: ""grubber $ goog : grubhub delivering solid growth ( grub ): URL"". It mentions grubber's products providing solid growth. This could indicate a positive market trend or good news from a specific sector related to Google products.

Tweets 9-10 talk about NASDAQ surpassing pre-bubble highs, with AT_USER interacting with large amounts of Google. These seem like positive trends that would benefit the stock if they lead to more activity in the tech sector.

Tweet 11 mentions midday stocks and talks about top stories on the market, including a few companies. The mention could indicate increased interest in tech stocks as more people are active.

Now, putting this all together: tweets 1, 2, 3, 7, 9-10 seem to provide positive information about Google's performance or related sectors that might positively impact the stock. However, some tweets like 4 and 5 mention AT_USER flirtying with Google but don't directly talk about Google itself, which could make it unclear if they're affecting the stock price negatively.

Given all this, the overall sentiment is likely positive because there's a lot of information suggesting that Google is doing well or related companies are benefiting. The positive tweets from different angles contribute to a favorable outlook."
2015-04-25,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on a company's stock price. The user has given me 17 tweets, and from the output example, they only selected tweet number 4 for analysis. Let me see what that is.

First, looking at tweet number 4: ""rt AT_USER teambillionaire calling all traders $ mnkd $ mat $ uup $ trn $ vale $ logi $ gwph $ aavl $ fb $ twtr $ goog $ aapl to join us & …"". The word ""teambillionaire"" is used, which I'm assuming refers to Amazon or something else in the billion-dollar range. 

Looking at other tweets: tweets 1-3 are all repeated similarly, talking about the same topic. Then tweet 4 is an additional statement by AT_USER, emphasizing the importance of joining the team. Tweets 5-7 repeat these actions.

So, this seems to be a call to action or informational tweet. These types of tweets often carry positive sentiment because they're informing investors about something important and encouraging them to take certain actions, which can positively influence stock prices by signaling confidence in the company's future performance.

However, sometimes repeated statements can have varying effects depending on context. If it's just a call to action without mentioning anything negative or providing details that could contradict, it might be considered positive because it shows commitment and support from the community. 

I should consider if there are any negative factors here. There's no mention of reduced earnings, increased competition, or other red flags. It's all about team announcements, which can sometimes be seen as a sign of stability or future plans for the company.

Therefore, putting it together, these tweets likely have a positive impact on the stock price because they're promoting an action (joining the group) and are informative enough to suggest that the management is focused positively on the company's future."
2015-04-26,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided a list of tweets about Google and some other companies like Apple and Yelp. They want an analysis of these tweets to determine the likely impact on the stock price of one of them. 

First, I need to understand what each tweet is saying. Most of them seem to be questioning or discussing how Google's search algorithms are changing, which could affect their services. For example, some tweets mention new tech companies and their subscriber numbers, which might indicate changes in their user base. However, others like the first few tweets talk about comparing ""too superficial a comparison"" without providing specific details on what regulators are doing.

I should break down each tweet into its factors—Positive and Negative. But since many tweets are speculative or don't provide clear sentiment, it's hard to assess the exact impact. The majority of the tweets are about search engine changes and subscriber numbers, which are related but not necessarily indicative of a significant stock move. 

Given that most tweets don't specify how these changes would affect the target company's stock price, I can only speculate based on trends. For instance, if there were posts about increased competition or new services, it might imply broader market movements rather than direct company performance. However, without concrete information, it's challenging to determine the impact accurately.

Since the user is asking for a single line conclusion at the end, I should stick to what I can infer from the tweets provided. They don't mention anything specific about Google or its stock price changes, just the trend in their search algorithm updates and subscriber numbers. This lack of direct information makes it difficult to assign a definite sentiment like Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

I need to decide how to handle this. If I have to make an assumption based on the trend, maybe leaning towards a Neutral stance because each tweet is pointing toward ongoing changes rather than any specific positive or negative impact. However, that might be too cautious since some tweets are about new tech companies with potential effects on their services.

Alternatively, if I consider that more users are looking for better services due to search algorithm changes, it could imply a shift in the company's market position, which might lead to increased demand and thus a Positive impact. But without knowing how much of a shift that would be or other factors influencing the stock price, it's risky.

Given the uncertainty, perhaps the safest approach is to conclude Neutral because there's no clear indication of positive or negative sentiment from the provided tweets. It’s safer not to take a stance based on incomplete information."
2015-04-27,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether these tweets will have a positive, neutral, or negative impact on the stock price of a company based on the given information. Let's start by analyzing each tweet one by one.

First, looking at the target stock symbol from the first tweet: $ goog, which is Alphabet Inc., known for Facebook and Google.

1. The first tweet says ""find active and helpful professional daytraders stock traders here URL $ goog $ aapl $ qqq URL."" I don't see any positive or negative info about Alphabet here, it's more general with URLs. So maybe this isn't impacting much yet.

2. Second tweet is about Facebook (FB) and WhatsApp (VIB). It mentions tracking earthquake survivors in Nepal. That could be relevant because tech companies often contribute to humanitarian efforts. But I'm not sure if that will directly affect Alphabet's stock, more of a side effect or unrelated news.

3. Third tweet also mentions Facebook and WhatsApp, similar to the previous one. The focus here is on how communications are hit by earthquake survivors. Again, this seems related but not directly about Alphabet. It might be a side note.

4. Fourth tweet talks about updating apps for earthquake victims, mentioning FB again. While it's tech-related, it's focused on helping others rather than the company itself. So probably no big impact here either.

5. Fifth tweet is about Alphabet using "" AT_USER stars ring the closing bell !"" Maybe that's some kind of countdown or countdown timer? Not sure how relevant this is to Alphabet's stock price unless they're running a promotional campaign, but it doesn't seem specific enough.

6. Sixth tweet mentions Google's wireless service (Wi-Fi). It says $ goog and no other companies are mentioned. This could be about new Wi-Fi products, which might not directly relate to Alphabet's earnings or performance. Not a clear indicator of stock impact.

7. Seventh tweet says ""vente stop de 15 acciones à 551 en $ goog vía AT_USER."" This translates to selling 15 shares at $551 each on VIB. That seems like a short sale, which would decrease the company's cash reserves but might not impact the stock price directly unless there are upcoming news.

8. Eighth tweet is about tech giants helping track survivors again. Similar to others before, this is more about external aid than Alphabet itself. No direct connection to their stock.

9. Ninth tweet discusses a patent purchase promotion and experimental marketing for outbidding patent trolls on Alphabet's platform. This seems like promotional activity or new products but doesn't provide any specific information about the company's financial performance or earnings.

10. Tenth tweet is comparing revenue growth between Facebook and Google. It mentions ""revenue growth comparisons"" which could indicate market competition or product line expansion. But unless there are specific metrics on Alphabet's stock, it might not directly affect their price movement.

11. Last tweet says closing two large trades for Alphabet at $555.84 with a gain of 0.3 USD, involving VIB. It's similar to other countdown tweets but again, no direct impact on the company's performance unless these transactions relate to revenue or stock buybacks.

After going through all the tweets, I don't see any that directly mention Alphabet Inc.'s performance, earnings, news related to their operations, or specific financial metrics. Most are about tech companies in unrelated sectors or promotional activities. So overall, none of these tweets seem to provide positive or negative information that would likely affect Alphabet's stock price."
2015-04-28,Positive,"Okay, so I have to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided 11 tweets, each suggesting something about Google or other companies. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions that platinum members saw a stock alert gain over 3100% in six months. That sounds like a huge positive. I think this could mean the stock is undervalued, so it's probably a positive sign.

2. The second tweet talks about a device that can read your mind and links to a Google app for wearables competition. This seems more like an innovation or a special feature rather than a negative impact on the stock price itself. Maybe just interesting but not directly affecting the stock.

3. The third tweet is from WMT, discussing recent news about Google on April 28th at 3:11 AM. It's speculation, but it might be talking about news that could influence investor sentiment or stock performance. I'm not sure yet.

4. Tweet number four links to TNA stock and mentions another stock market idea. This seems unrelated to Google, so probably doesn't affect the overall stock price negatively.

5. The fifth tweet talks about opening 4 large $ goog shares for USD at 555.14 with a volume of 216,217. That's a specific action related to Google, but without knowing if it's positive or negative info is hard to tell.

6. Tweet six also mentions Google and says it's still the best in class. This seems like an affirmation that the company is leading in its field, which could be positive for investor confidence.

7. Tweet seven mentions a VP of a client services firm at Facebook and Twitter. It's about the company's operations but not directly impacting Google's stock price unless mentioned otherwise.

8. Tweet eight talks about Google wanting to share more cloud numbers from fortune. Cloud sharing is important in tech, so maybe it could impact future performance positively by providing better infrastructure or user experience.

9. Tweet nine says that Google admits mistakes with its news outlets as they announce new developments. If there are errors, investors might be cautious, but if corrected, it's positive. The wording suggests they were aware of the issues before, which is good for their reputation.

10. Tweet ten mentions a 'one-sided' deal for Google's Twitter stock over the first 12 months. This seems like a strategic move, possibly to acquire competitors or expand into new markets. A one-sided deal could be both positive and negative if it leads to integration or not.

11. Tweet eleven discusses a mobilegddon that could alienate nearly half of Google's top sites. This is about user dissatisfaction with the product, which might decrease brand awareness and sales, leading to potential negative impact on the stock price.

Putting this all together, the tweets mostly seem positive in nature—mentioning gains, successful projects, or strategic moves—and some are speculative or less clear. However, there's uncertainty around tweet 10 because it doesn't specify if it's good or bad for Google. Also, tweet eleven is pretty negative about user dissatisfaction. So overall, the stock sentiment seems mixed but leaning positive. I'm leaning towards a Positive overall."
2015-04-29,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on stock price for the given company. The user wants the conclusion in just ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"". 

First, I need to extract the target stock from the tweets. Looking at tweet 1: ""now happening $ goog (with youtube)"" and ""squandered great op take…"". The key mentions are ""goog"", so maybe the stock is Google?

Next, for each tweet, I'll separate the factors into positive and negative. 

Tweet 1 talks about Google spending time with YouTube and wasting money on something else. That's a bit vague but could be considered neutral because it doesn't explicitly state if it's good or bad.

Tweet 2 mentions Google Glass V2 needing $ goog URL. It seems like an announcement, which is generally positive for investors as it's expanding into new tech. So this tweet is Positive.

Tweet 3 says that LG Electronics' Q1 net profit dropped by 58.5%. That's a significant drop in earnings, which would likely be Negative because it could indicate financial strain or instability.

Now, summarizing each tweet: 
- Tweet 1: Neutral
- Tweet 2: Positive
- Tweet 3: Negative

I need to assess how these factors collectively impact the stock. The positive tweet about Glass V2 is good news for investors, while the negative profit drop suggests potential issues that could affect future performance.

Considering both positive and negative factors, it's a mix rather than one or the other. However, given that Google Glass is a significant product, even a slight dip in earnings might be enough to impact the stock positively. But I'm not sure if this alone can outweigh other factors like YouTube spending.

I think the overall sentiment is leaning towards Neutral because while positive tweets add some good news, negative ones take away some value. It's a balanced view that could lead to uncertainty but perhaps for now it's neutral."
2015-04-30,Positive,"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company based on their analysis.

First, I see that each tweet is about the $ Google (GOOGL) stock. My goal is to determine if it's going up, staying around, or down. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions sprint and boingo hooking up for a Wi-Fi network to promote their network. It talks about promoting their network to millions of travelers. I'm not immediately sure how this affects Google's stock price. Promoting a product might be seen as a positive sign, but without knowing the company's specific performance or context, it's hard to say.

2. The second tweet is very short with some URL links and mentions several stock symbols: $ Dow tomorrow, $ Aapl, $ FB, $ ebay options stocks daytrading, $ options. It also includes some technical terms like 'daytrading' and options stocks. There are some confusing symbols here that I'm not entirely sure about. This tweet seems more about the broader market or possible stock movements rather than directly affecting Google's performance.

3. The third tweet talks about thinking about the value in $ Google, $googl$, $apl$, $amzn$. It discusses cloud values and compares CRM to a $74 figure. Again, without knowing the company's financials or other metrics related to Google, it's hard to assess the impact on their stock price.

4. The fourth tweet starts with ""abriendo 3 largos de $ goog a 537.43 usd"" which translates to opening 3 large shares of $ Google at $537.43 USD each. This is clearly an action by Google buying shares, which would likely increase their stock price. The fact that they also mention specific prices and IDs suggests it's about purchasing stock.

5. The fifth tweet says ""Google inc . yells 'fee-fi-foe-fum ' and URL inc . 's announces earnings."" This is interesting because it seems like Google is making fun of itself and then announcing an earnings report. Earnings reports are usually a positive sign, especially if they're good news for the company.

Now, combining these thoughts: The fourth tweet shows Google buying shares at specific prices, which directly impacts their stock price. The fifth tweet gives a bit more context about Google's performance, mentioning earnings which is often a strong indicator of future profitability and stock price movement.

So, putting it all together, there are clear positive actions related to Google's stock. They're buying shares and potentially announcing good earnings. This suggests that the overall sentiment towards Google's stock should be positive."
2015-05-01,Negative,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a given company. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

Starting with the first tweet: ""will it survive ? find out here : URL $ upro $ grpo $ ocat $ ibb $ hyg $ ilmn $ xon $ ziop $ goog $ aapl URL"". Hmm, this looks like a typo or maybe some code formatting. It mentions a URL for a stock called something with upr and gro groups. I'm not sure what the stock is yet, but it seems like the tweet isn't providing any direct information about the company's performance.

The second tweet: ""can yahoo's new search deal withMicrosoft help to control its spiraling tac ? $ goog google $ googl $ msft $ yhoo"". This one mentions ""search deal"" and ""control spiraling tac."" I'm not sure what ""tac"" stands for in this context. If it means something related to the company's strategy or target, it could be signaling a potential issue or change in strategy that might affect their stock price.

Third tweet: ""great trades , bulls be careful . $ googl $ goog $ amzn $ fb $ gpro $ slv $ ibm $ gs $ aapl $ cat $ bidu $ nflx $ ba $ dia $ qqq $ spy URL"". This one has some tech-related words like amZN, FB, GPRO, etc. It seems to be talking about the stock market in general and perhaps advising caution for bulls (market followers) due to potential issues.

Fourth tweet: "" $ goog google inc messenger app lets you text back from the notifications tray : google inc messenger app lets ..."". This is a message from a search engine suggesting that they have a messenger app where users can send messages. It might indicate an update or feature change, but I'm not sure how this affects the stock price.

Fifth tweet: ""rt $ fb algos triggered sell in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 08:56 . p / t 77.00 $ goog $ twtr $ bidu $ gpro $ nflx $ tsla $ aapl $ qqq hft quant"". This seems to mention Facebook's algos causing selling pressure on several stocks, including FB (which is Alphabet Inc., a tech giant). It could be suggesting that there might be negative news affecting these companies.

Sixth tweet: ""rt $ fb algos broke 78.80 level in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @11:20 p/t 77.00 $ goog $ twtr $ bidu $ gpro $ nflx $ tsla $ aapl $ qqq hft quant"". Similar to the previous tweet, but with a different time frame and stock levels. It might be indicating that Facebook's price has dipped below a certain level on several stocks.

Seventh tweet: ""the case that apple is worth at least $200 per share URL $ googl $ msft $ goog $ aapl"". This seems like an offer or hint about the value of Apple stock, but I'm not sure if it's positive or negative. It could mean that investors are excited about Apple's potential value or might be concerned about its actual performance.

Eighth tweet: ""rt AT_USER can yahoo's new search deal withMicrosoft help to control its spiraling tac ? URL $ goog google $ googl …"". Similar to the second tweet, this mentions a search deal potentially affecting Microsoft's strategy. It could indicate a potential change in the company's approach or target, which might impact their stock.

Putting it all together, some tweets are about Facebook (FB) and Apple (AAPL), suggesting potential changes in their valuations. Others mention other stocks like Google and Microsoft, which are more general. The lack of specific information about each stock's performance makes it hard to assess the overall sentiment definitively. However, the presence of ""spiraling tac"" indicates a possible issue or change in strategy that could affect market sentiment. 

But since I don't have the exact details of each company's current financial health, like revenue growth, earnings reports, or other metrics, it's challenging to classify each tweet as positive, neutral, or negative. Without this context, the impact on the stock price is uncertain."
2015-05-02,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out how these tweets are impacting the stock price of a company. Let me start by going through each tweet one by one.

First tweet: ""platinum members saw our stock alerts gain 3100 % in 6 months ! subscribe here : URL $ erbb $ bbda $ goog"". Hmm, they're talking about gains and mentions Apple's stock (GOOGL). That sounds positive because a big increase could boost the price.

Second tweet: ""rt AT_USER even before apple watch snafu , tattoo removal business was up 440 % : URL $ aapl $ goog $ pcln $ k"". This one is also talking about gains. Even though there's a mention of an Apple Watch issue, they're focusing on the tattoo removal company (CLN) going up. That might be a bit more about a specific sector or a smaller company.

Third tweet: ""baidu : rain rain go away URL $ baba $ goog $ qihu $ sohu $ bidu"". This is making some meta comments with words like ""rain"" and ""go away."" I'm not sure what this implies. It could be a bit of filler or maybe related to stock performance, but it's hard to tell without more context.

Fourth tweet: ""AT_USER $ twtr will not have been sold to $ goog or $ fb ."" They're saying that the Apple Watch (TWTR) won't be sold to Google or Facebook. This seems like a negative statement because if a company isn't sold off, it could indicate financial instability, which might lead to lower stock prices.

Fifth tweet: ""rt AT_USER spreadsheet of the day : the latest apple price targets : URL $ aapl $ goog $ pcln $ k"". Again, this is talking about gains with Apple's stock. The mention of targeting prices suggests they're concerned about reaching certain levels, which could be positive for investors who are looking to reach cap tables.

Sixth tweet: ""rising dollar is tech stocks ' new asian contagion : URL $ aapl $ goog $ pcln $ k"". The US Dollar is rising in Asia? That sounds concerning. If the US Dollar strengthens, especially in Asia, it can impact global markets and could affect tech stock prices negatively because higher exchange rates might make exports or costs more expensive.

Seventh tweet: ""why it goes against as soon as trade executed ? wharmonics forex stocks futures spy $ spy eurusd $ eurusd goog $ goog usdtry $ usdtry"". This seems like a meta comment questioning the trend once trade is done. It's unclear what they're referring to, but something about the market going against expectations with terms like ""wharmonics"" and ""forex stocks futures spy."" Not sure how this relates to stock performance, so it's hard to assess.

Now, summarizing each tweet:

1. Positive
2. Positive (specifically on a tech company)
3. Maybe positive or neutral
4. Negative because selling off TwTR is concerning for the company's future
5. Positive due to concerns about currency strengthening
6. Negative because rising US Dollar in Asia could hurt tech stocks
7. Not very informative, hard to say

Overall sentiment seems mixed. Some tweets are definitely positive (1-2-5), a few negative (4 and 6). The third tweet is unclear, so maybe neutral. Therefore, the overall sentiment is a mix of positive and negative factors."
2015-05-03,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the likely impact on the future stock price based on these tweets about different companies.

First, looking at each tweet:

1. The first tweet mentions several stocks like $goog, $pcln, and others but doesn't provide any specific information. It's more about general trends. I'm not sure what those tweets are suggesting; maybe they're positive or negative based on the names, but without context it's hard to tell.

2. The second tweet says Apple will dominate by 2020. That sounds very positive because Apple is a major player in tech, so if this is true, it could indicate strong growth and potential for upward movement.

3. The third tweet mentions Google dropping by -3% and advises people about their featured tweet on the market. This seems like a technical analysis warning, which suggests caution or reassurance based on recent performance, which might indicate negative sentiment because of the drop.

4. The fourth tweet talks about technical analysis and charting for AAPL (Apple's stock). Similar to the third tweet, this is about giving advice on analyzing stocks, which can be positive if it's seen as a helpful tip.

5. The fifth tweet mentions something related to IPhi corp and its recent performance in trends. This could be positive or negative depending on how their latest activity affects investor sentiment.

Now, considering each tweet individually:

- The first tweet is vague.
- The second tweet suggests a strong future direction for Apple.
- The third tweet points out a drop in Google's stock but doesn't state the reason. It might imply a cautious approach if it's a recent trend.
- The fourth tweet gives advice on technical analysis, which can be seen as helpful and could lead to positive actions from investors.
- The fifth tweet is about IPhi's trends, which again isn't providing a clear direction.

Putting this together: Apple's dominance by 2020 sounds very positive. Google might cause some concern if it drops, but the other tweets provide context or advice on how to invest in tech stocks. So overall, with Apple looking promising and others being analyzed, there seems to be a mix of positive and negative factors, but the dominant perspective suggests upward potential."
2015-05-04,Negative,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of Microsoft. Let me go through each tweet one by one and see what they're saying.

First tweet: It mentions ""worst sentiment for sp1500 stocks at midday"". That sounds pretty negative. Midday is late afternoon, which might be a good time to sell if you're selling stocks then because prices are usually higher around noon or later in the day. But I'm not sure how much that affects overall sentiment.

Second tweet: It talks about sergey Brin co-founder selling $18,056 worth of Google stock and mentions it's an insider trading transaction. That sounds like a significant sell-off because it's about a company that's already well-known, especially with the Google stock mentioned. Insider trading usually indicates investor sentiment is down or negative.

Third tweet: It links Blta, Baltia Airlines, Inc., to $ goog, $ orcl, $ bib, etc. This seems like a link to a blog post from Blta or something related. I don't have specific information on what that's about, but since it's linking a company to Google stock, it might suggest a strategic decision by Blta regarding Google.

Fourth tweet: Discusses a pharmaceuticals stock and mentions ""click here"" for more info. It talks about applying Android software in Microsoft apps. That sounds like a positive sign because having mobile apps can be beneficial and often leads to growth. So that's probably good news.

Fifth tweet: Talks about M&A (mergers and acquisitions) strategies from Google, particularly their approach to acquisitions involving Google's approach. This could indicate a strategic decision by Google regarding its acquisitions, which might influence investor sentiment if it affects competitors or company performance.

Sixth tweet: Discusses Google automating time management in their apps with $ goog URL. That sounds like a strategic move that could improve efficiency and productivity, which is a positive sign for the company's growth and stock price.

Seventh tweet: Links Rad Rite Aid Corp., last price to $ goog, $ jnpr, $ amlp, etc. It mentions NASDAQ stocks, but without specific information on what it's about, it's hard to say. Maybe it's another link or analysis related to Google?

Eighth tweet: Suggests Microsoft will release announcements about their own products like Bing and Azure in two weeks. That seems positive because it's a long-term strategic decision for the company, which is often seen as good news by investors. It can boost stock price due to future growth.

Ninth tweet: Discusses a Google webinar on earnings breakdown, part 1. The earnings call could indicate financial performance and be a positive sign if the company is expected to perform well. This might give investors confidence in their stock.

Now, let me summarize each tweet's impact:

1. Negative (worst sentiment)
2. Strong negative due to insider trading
3. Linking to Google stock, which may affect Blta's strategy
4. Positive because of Android integration and potential growth
5. Strategic move by Google, possibly affecting their performance
6. Positive automating time management, enhancing productivity
7. Linking to Google stock; might be a strategic decision
8. Long-term positive for future products like Bing and Azure
9. Positive earnings call could indicate good financial health

Looking at these, the main positive factors are 4, 6, 8, and 9. 2 is definitely negative. 7 seems like it's part of a link to Google stock, which might not have direct information, but if Blta is buying into Google for strategic reasons, that could influence sentiment. The negatives are mainly tweet 1.

So overall, the positive tweets outweigh the negative ones. Additionally, the strategic moves in tweets 5, 7, and 9 could indirectly affect sentiment by influencing companies that might be affected by Google's actions."
2015-05-05,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for a given company. The user provided a list of eight tweets and specified how to assess each one.

First, I'll identify the target stock in each tweet. It seems like several tweets mention $ goog, which is Google's symbol. So I'll focus on Google.

Now, looking at each tweet:

1. ""platinum subscribers saw our stock picks gain over 1400 % in 2 months ! subscribe here : URL $ amzn $ mcox $ goog"". The user mentions Google's stock gains, so positive.

2. ""$ goog $ aapl $ goog $ mck"" is about Google's stock performance. Positive because of the ""_gain"" mentioned.

3. ""today ’ t promised to anyone - update from option millionaires..."" Also discusses Google and positive action, so positive.

4. ""-1.997 % "". The tweet mentions a slight drop in Google's stock price. That would be neutral because it's a small negative impact.

5. ""$ goog $ aapl $ goog $ mtw $ cat $ x $ c $ csco $ t $ se $ wu $ mu $ wba URL"". Positive since it lists multiple companies but the tweet isn't about Google specifically, so maybe slight positive. Or perhaps neutral because not all tweets are directly related.

6. ""daily funding report $ goog training"". This seems to be a news article, so positive if it's good or negative if bad. But without context, it's unclear; might be considered neutral.

7. ""- retailmenot reports slide in first quarter profit - 2nd update URL"". Negative because of decreasing profits, which lowers investor confidence, making the stock price more likely to fall. So negative sentiment here.

8. ""- aapl $ goog $ twtr may 5th , 2015 watch list - update from option millionaires ..."". This mentions Google's performance on a specific date, so positive because it shows a recent event affecting the stock.

Now, summarizing each tweet:

1. Positive
2. Positive
3. Positive
4. Neutral (small drop)
5. Not directly about Google, but multiple companies involved – might be neutral.
6. Not sure, could be neutral or slightly negative but no clear info – perhaps neutral.
7. Negative
8. Positive

Adding up the sentiment: mostly positive tweets are 1,2,3,8, and a mix of neutral and one negative (4). The overall sentiment is a mix of positive and some negative factors. Since it's mixed, the impact might be neutral because there aren't clear positives outweighing negatives or vice versa.

Wait, let me check again:

- Tweets 1,2,3: Positive
- Tweet 4: Neutral
- Tweet 5: Not directly Google, but maybe still considered positive if it's a general update about tech companies. But I'm not sure.
- Tweet 6: Unclear, so could be neutral.
- Tweet7: Negative
- Tweet8: Positive

So tweets 1,2,3,8 are positive; 4 and 5 (if 5 is positive) would make it mostly positive. But if tweet 5 isn't about Google, maybe tweet 5 is not directly relevant, making it neutral or slight negative.

I think overall, the impact might be a mix of positive and slightly negative, but leaning towards a neutral sentiment because there are mixed reactions without strong positive indicators dominating."
2015-05-06,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I should extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the tweets:

1. The first one is ""goog google inc . - class c shares click here -> URL trending $ goog $ mvtg $ slb $ dia goog stocks stockmarket."" So, the stock is Google (GOOG).

2. The second tweet mentions AT_USER and talks about automating time management. That doesn't seem directly related to a stock symbol.

3. Third tweet has some company names like $ dal $ dg $ goog $ googl $ aapl $ gm $ f $ slv $ dust. This looks like it's targeting Google again, so GOOG.

4. The fourth tweet mentions FNMA and other companies about trading ideas. Doesn't look related to a stock symbol.

5. Fifth tweet talks about penny stocks closing up, mentioning GPCH. No stock here.

6. Sixth tweet is about IBM (IBM) and Google (GOOG). This could be related because it's about their performance.

7. Seventh tweet links to real-time company contracts from AT_USER, not a stock symbol.

8. Eighth tweet says Google is bigger on mobile than desktop in 10 countries, which might affect the overall market but doesn't directly point to another stock.

Now, focusing on GOOG because it's clearly the target stock across multiple tweets.

Analyzing each relevant tweet:

1. ""class c shares"" mentions class C shares, so positive about their performance.
2. ""automated time management in its apps"" doesn't affect GOOG directly.
3. ""original agreements and executive updates from AT_USER"" again no direct impact on GOOG.
4. No mention of GOOG here.
5. Discussing penny stocks but not GOOG.
6. Talks about stock trading ideas, so positive sentiment.

The main positive factors are the increase in GPCH (maybe another stock) and trading ideas around GOOG. However, since it's about Google's performance, especially its tech sector which is generally strong, this could indicate a positive sentiment.

Additionally, the fact that AT_USER mentions company contracts from Google adds to the confidence in their future performance."
2015-05-07,Neutral,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for the given company. The user has provided 9 tweets, each focusing on different stocks or aspects related to Google. My task is to assess each tweet's sentiment towards determining the overall effect.

Starting with tweet 1: It mentions learning technical analysis and charting, which are important for investors but might not have a direct positive or negative impact unless they're referring to a specific stock. Since it's about multiple stocks, it's more of an informational tweet rather than a sentiment one, so maybe a [Neutral] for the stock.

Tweet 2 is about AT_USER asking why $ goog just bought linked in. This seems like a follow-up question or a query, which isn't expressing any strong positive or negative opinion. So, probably [Neutral].

Tweet 3 lists several stocks and links to trading platforms. The user is asking for your own trading path, so again, this is more about seeking advice rather than influencing stock prices directly. [Neutral] makes sense here.

Tweet 4 refers to a YouTube video on women's business in bubbles by Yellen. This seems like an informative tweet promoting content but not expressing sentiment towards the stock. So another [Neutral].

Tweet 5 asks why $ goog is higher than $ msft and suggests using live stock prices via sheets or Excel, which are tools for analysis rather than expressing opinion. [Neutral] fits.

Tweet 6 talks about supertrades buying a freakin house, which sounds like a joke, not related to the stock. Probably [Neutral].

Tweet 7 discusses Tesla's price relative to Google and mentions stat arb corrections in trading. It's an informative tweet but doesn't indicate sentiment towards the stock. So [Neutral].

Finally, tweet 8 links to trends for American Airlines Group and mentions trade ideas. Again, not a direct statement about the stock, so [Neutral].

Putting it all together, none of these tweets express any clear positive or negative sentiment towards any specific stock. They're more about information or commentary rather than influencing investor decisions. Therefore, the overall impact is Neutral."
2015-05-08,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of Google. So, I've got six tweets here, and each seems to be focusing on different aspects related to Google's performance. 

Starting with tweet 1, it says ""google inc. ( $ goog ) looking hot ! currently priced at 536.67 . URL"". This one looks like an upbeat message, mentioning that Google is doing well. It sounds positive because it's talking about the company's health and its current valuation. So, this tweet seems to be a positive sentiment.

Next up, tweet 2: ""goog gopro , inc . yield click here -> URL trending $ goog $ leg.to $ infn $ uvxy goog finance stock"". This one talks about the stock trends but doesn't give much detailed info. It's more of an announcement or report rather than something that directly affects investor sentiment. So, this tweet is probably neutral because it's not providing enough data to tip the balance.

Tweet 3: ""rt AT_USER here's what yelp ceo jeremy stoppelman said about google trying to buy … URL google $ goog $ googlel http ..."". This seems more speculative and promotional. It mentions a CEO talking about Google buying something, which could indicate potential growth or success. While it doesn't provide specific details on the stock price, the mention of a company that competes with Google suggests positive factors like product development or strategic moves. So, this tweet adds some positivity.

Then we have tweet 4: ""$ goog - how youtube found itself producing original content URL"". This one seems to be about YouTube's success in creating original content, which could indirectly impact Google's stock if they're related. But again, without specific company metrics or trends, it's hard to gauge a strong positive sentiment here.

Tweet 5 mentions ""optionstraining video : payoff diagrams URL $ goog $ googl $ tsls $ tqqq $ xlv $ xnrg $ nke $ dia"". This is talking about options trading and payoff diagrams. While this could be related to stock movements, it's more of a discussion on investment strategies or technical analysis rather than directly affecting the stock price. So, this tweet adds some positive information without a strong enough impact.

Finally, tweet 6: ""closed short $ goog may 530 puts AT_USER + 64 %"". This is about options trading again but specifically mentions puts with a strike price of May 530 and a gain percentage of +64%. Like the previous tweet, it's speculative and not providing concrete information. It might suggest potential profits but doesn't directly influence investor sentiment.

Now, putting this all together: The first tweet is clearly positive. The second is neutral. The third adds some positive thoughts on Google's competition. Tweets 4 and 5 are speculative and don't have strong enough impact to change the overall sentiment. Tweet 6 is also speculative but mentions a potential gain in options trading. So, considering all these tweets, while there are several positive elements, especially around Google's performance and its competitive environment, some tweets are speculative or more about different aspects of the stock rather than directly affecting its price.

But wait, tweet 5 specifically talks about payoff diagrams used by options traders. Payoff diagrams can affect stock prices as they represent potential gains based on underlying asset prices. So if Google is involved in these strategies, it might influence investor sentiment positively. However, since it's speculative and not concrete data, the impact isn't significant enough to change the overall conclusion.

Given that tweet 5 introduces a positive factor related to options trading which could have some effect, but all other tweets are either neutral or positive with less direct impact, I'm leaning towards an overall positive sentiment. The context suggests Google is doing well and has opportunities in various areas like product development, financial reporting, or speculative strategies."
2015-05-09,Positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out how these tweets are affecting the stock price of a company, and whether it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me start by understanding each tweet.

First, looking at tweet 1: It mentions several stocks like NFLX, BAC, AMZN, MSFT, APPL, GOOGL, GOOGL, FEY, URL. The words ""great free tutorial here for traders"" seem supportive and positive. These kinds of messages are generally good because they attract attention and encourage action. So that's a strong positive sign.

Next, tweet 2: It lists more stocks including TCL, TwTR, FB, APL, EBAY, GM, DIEST, BABA. The user is talking about the ""eye of the tiger"" which sounds like it might be a meme or meme-related content. However, the words are mostly neutral and can sometimes be misleading because they're not always clear what the speaker is referring to. While there's some uncertainty in sentiment, especially since some companies like APPL (Apple) are going through a tough period. Still, the overall impact isn't overwhelmingly positive.

Then, tweet 3: It lists NymX, Nymox, pharmaceutical companies, ex-divide dates, and trending. This seems to be more about trends or future announcements that might affect stock prices. The mention of GOOG (Google) suggests a possible shift in tech-related stocks. While this could have positive implications if Google is coming into the market, it's also uncertain because tech sectors are inherently volatile.

Finally, tweet 4: It mentions P.CH (""patrick pichette"") and the fact that Google Inc. has insider unloaded shares. Paternity jokes can sometimes be exaggerated or misleading but in this context, they might seem like a positive signal to investors who trade based on insider information. However, it's worth noting that stock trading is often speculative and subject to market reactions.

Putting all these together: Each tweet contributes a bit of positive news about Google-related companies and offers hints about future trends. But the impact isn't consistent because some tweets are more certain while others introduce uncertainty. Despite the mixed signals, I think there's an overall positive outlook, especially since they're pointing towards Google, which is already showing signs of improvement."
2015-05-10,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to figure out their impact on the stock price. The first tweet mentions an antitrust investigation into Beats Music and talks about revamping the music service. That sounds like it could be a major regulatory move, which might hurt company performance.

The second tweet updates the $vxx stock message board on May 9, 2015. I'm not exactly sure what vxx stands for, but maybe it's another stock index or something related to tech or music? If it's a market-moving event with positive info, that could boost investor confidence.

Looking at the factors: The first tweet is definitely negative because of antitrust issues and regulatory changes. The second tweet is on an important date, so its content is relevant and likely positive. Combining these two, the overall sentiment seems to be mixed but leans towards a positive note since it's related to a significant event."
2015-05-11,Positive,"Okay, let's try to figure out the likely impact of these tweets on the stock price of the companies mentioned. 

Starting with tweet 1: It says Google Play allows pre-registering for apps and games. That seems positive because it shows they're expanding their services, which is a good sign. So that's a Positive factor.

Tweet 2 mentions rdsh holdings as stocks in three different companies: $rdsh, $csco, $goog, etc. It talks about trends and finance, so I'm not sure how this affects their stock prices directly. Maybe they're investing or managing assets? But it doesn't clearly state a positive or negative impact yet.

Tweet 3 is about AT_USER $ goog ordering food for delivery from Google's results. This sounds like an exciting development in the tech sector, especially if they're expanding into logistics and e-commerce. That could boost stock prices, which would be Positive.

Tweet 4 mentions AT_USER $ goog and $ msft using automated solutions for bigdata and containers. If these firms are more efficient or scalable, it's likely good news. So another Positive factor.

Tweet 5 is a bit confusing with some typos like ""future"" instead of ""fcau."" It suggests that if a major tech firm takes on FCAU, both Google and Apple might be interested in reshaping the sector. This seems positive because it indicates potential growth areas, which could attract investors and boost stock prices.

Finally, tweet 6 is about Microsoft's 13% celebration being premature, mentioning other companies like AWA and others. I'm not sure what this means for Microsoft's stock but perhaps it's more of a commentary or an event that might lead to something, so maybe Neutral or Positive? It could indicate optimism or a shift in perspective.

Now, putting it all together: Tweets 1, 3, 4, and 5 are positive because they expand services or show potential for growth. Tweet 6 is a bit ambiguous but possibly indicates a more stable outlook due to investors' concern about the timeline of things changing.

So overall sentiment seems Positive because there's optimism from various developments."
2015-05-12,Negative,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on TSLA's stock price. Let me go through each tweet one by one and see what they're saying.

First tweet: It mentions a lawsuit filed against Amazon for making hard to borrow $TSLA stock for short selling. That sounds like bad news because if there are legal issues, investors might be worried about getting access to the stock, which usually benefits them financially. So that's probably negative.

Second tweet: It looks like someone is logging into a live stock chat URL and mentions options stocks and daytrading. Not too specific about the sentiment here; it's more of a setup for other information or updates. I don't think this has a strong impact on TSLA, so maybe nothing.

Third tweet: The user says they executed a buy order at $55 for Google stock, ending at around $530.14 in 2015. This is about trading activity, which can sometimes be a sign that there's potential demand, but it's not clear if it directly affects TSLA. Plus, it seems like an unusual action from someone named ""Ejutado,"" which might just be a typo or placeholder. So, maybe neutral.

Fourth tweet: The user shares news about TSLA stock gaining 77.77% from last week's low. That sounds positive because a 70+ percentage increase is significant and usually indicates that the stock is doing well. It could be a signal of strong earnings or other positive developments, which would likely boost the stock price.

Fifth tweet: This one talks about learning technical analysis and charting for TSLA. Technical analysis provides information, but it's more about strategies than predicting stock prices directly. So, maybe not the most direct impact.

Sixth tweet: The user is listing stocks to buy now—like PTBI, VGGL, Kerx, etc.—but nothing specific about TSLA. It seems like they're just sharing a list of opportunities, which might help, but I don't think it's directly affecting TSLA yet.

Seventh tweet: This mentions nugtxion gold miners with a 3x share news and links to trending Google stock. It sounds like technical analysis or news about the company's performance, possibly related to trends in the stock price. If there are positive news about Google's performance, it could influence TSLA if they're correlated.

Eighth tweet: The user is placing alerts on picking stocks based on cash and mentions a review service. This seems more like a business strategy or marketing tool rather than directly affecting stock prices. So, maybe minimal impact.

Ninth tweet: There's a reference to Google's top minds deciding what to forget, which might indicate uncertainty about future events. Could this affect investor sentiment? It could be positive if it means there are concerns or risks, but I'm not sure how significant that is.

Tenth tweet: Another review about picking stocks with $CBI, MA, V, ICPT, DECK, and GOOG. Similar to the eighth tweet, this seems like a marketing strategy rather than directly impacting TSLA's price.

Putting it all together, the main positive signals are the lawsuit (which could be negative), but some tweets talk about gains (positive). The third tweet was speculative trading, which might not have a big impact. The fourth tweet is an increase in stock value, so that's a strong positive. The seventh tweet mentions trends or news on Google, which might influence TSLA if they're related.

So overall, there are mixed signals—some positive, some negative, and some speculative trading. But the most significant factor is the 77% increase, which seems like a clear upward trend. However, since there's also a lawsuit that could negatively impact the stock price, it's hard to say if the overall sentiment is positive or not. Maybe neutral because while the stock did gain a lot, there are underlying issues that might make investors cautious."
2015-05-13,Neutral,"Alright, so I need to analyze these tweets and determine if they affect the stock price of a company in one of three ways: positive, neutral, or negative. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

Starting with the first tweet, it mentions making $94,000 in one trade and talks about the stock symbols involved—AMZN, MCOX, GOOG. There's no direct mention of a prediction or concern about the stock price here. So probably not positive or negative from this point.

The second tweet speculates that Google is going to drop some percentage on rumors about its battery hiring lawsuit. This seems like a negative outlook but it's speculative. It doesn't provide concrete information or expert opinions, so I'll consider this as neutral for now.

Third tweet is an RT handle mentioning the same speculative rumor about Google losing value due to rumors. Similar to the second one, just rehashing the same news. Again, too vague without specifics, so maybe still in the gray area of not providing enough info.

Fourth tweet talks about AT_USER (I assume they mean the user) speculating that Google's app will launch an apple watch. No mention of stock prices or market performance; just a prediction and a link. Doesn't affect the stock price directly.

Fifth tweet is also RT, talking about different stocks like $DAL, $DG, etc., all related to GOOG. It mentions something about dividends but doesn't specify the outcome. So probably not positive or negative impact on the stock price.

Sixth tweet mentions that Apple's A123 is close to settling a battery hiring lawsuit. This seems like an internal company matter with no direct connection to the stock price of any particular company. Not providing information, so it might be considered neutral because it's speculative and without concrete data.

Seventh tweet ends with ""since your tweet was sent, GOOG has dropped 2.015%."" Here we have a specific number given about a stock, GOOG (Google). The drop of 2.015% is a significant change in price movement. Typically, such drops can be seen as positive because it shows the stock might be undervalued or could be overvalued depending on context. But since it's based on the user's tweet and there's no external data to back it up, it's hard to say definitively.

Putting this all together: The only significant change here is a drop in GOOG stock, but without more information about other factors like earnings, revenue, or news events, it's just one piece of data. It might indicate uncertainty or potential, which could be positive if investors are cautious, but since the user didn't provide context on why this drop happened or any other indicators, I'm leaning towards it being neutral because it doesn't have enough information to make a strong judgment."
2015-05-14,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze the given tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let's go through each tweet step by step.

First, identifying the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""dd dupont co . e . p . s . click here -> URL trending $ dd $ cat $ vltc $ goog dd stockmarket investing."" It doesn't seem to specify a particular stock symbol, which is confusing. The next few tweets mention different stocks but without a clear target, so I might need to make an assumption or maybe look for patterns across the tweets.

The second tweet: ""$ goog - investing in the online travel industry : does your portfolio need a getaway ? URL"" This one clearly mentions ""goog,"" which might be Google. The word ""investing"" suggests they're looking at financial investments, possibly related to stock prices. It seems like someone is concerned about their investment choices and maybe advising others.

The third tweet: ""AT_USER f ford motor co . stock forum click here -> URL trending $ f $ goog $ ge $ efa f invest stockmarket"" Again, mentions Ford, which is associated with the Ford Motor Company. The phrase ""investing stockmarket"" indicates that they're interested in stocks and possibly the market trends.

The fourth tweet: ""$ uup powershares db us dollar index bullish fund e . p . s . click here -> URL trending $ uup $ dba $ slw $ goog uup …"" UUP is a tech company known for their software solutions. The mention of ""dollar index bullish"" suggests they're looking at the stock performance relative to the US dollar.

The fifth tweet: ""$ stocks of the billionaires URL billgates warrenbuffett carlosslim $ msft $ baba $ amzn $ fb $ goog URL"" This one is more about Bill Gates, who was a tech figure, and mentions Warren Buffett. They're talking about investing in large companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook.

Now, considering the overall sentiment. The tweets are mostly discussing different sectors but seem to be addressing investment-related topics. There's a mix of positive and negative opinions—some like Google, Ford, UUP, Bill Gates, and Warren Buffett who have strong financial backgrounds and significant investments in tech stocks. These individuals often provide well-thought-out advice and tend to be more opinionated.

However, the company's stock price hasn't been provided or discussed here, so I can't directly assess it. But based on the context of investment advice from these figures, their influence might be considered positive if they're seen as credible and informed. However, since the impact isn't quantifiable, I should stick to the given options.

Since the sentiment is more about opinions and guidance rather than market data, perhaps leaning towards a positive overall sentiment because people who invest are generally supportive of positive trends."
2015-05-15,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a given company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol. From the tweets, it seems like "" goog "" is mentioned multiple times with terms like $ goog, $ amzn, etc., so the target stock must be Google, GOOGL. I should focus on that.

Now, processing each tweet:

1. The first tweet mentions all positive tweets about the stock, which are nearly 20% in value since its entry moments ago. So definitely positive.
2. Second tweet talks about logging into a live stock chat URL with google options stocks and daytrading. That's mostly negative because it suggests potential losses.
3. Third tweet is about Google's self-driving cars and listing the URL. Positive again because it's about a company's innovation or growth potential.
4. Fourth tweet repeats points from the second one, emphasizing positive growth with $ goog, etc.
5. Fifth tweet says that TSLA broke 246 in Sigma-X, crossfinder, ATS, LX, and mentions several companies, some of which are negative because they're being listed as stock symbols. So there's some mixed sentiment here since it's both positive (TSLA breaking) and negative (other companies).
6. Sixth tweet is similar to the second one, talking about potential losses due to a market correction.
7. Seventh tweet repeats the same as before, all positives.
8. Eighth tweet reiterates positive points again.
9. Ninth tweet discusses Tesla's stock price but doesn't mention Google specifically. The user is talking about TSLA in context of other companies, so maybe slightly negative because it might impact the overall market, even though it's a tech company.
10. Tenth tweet talks about TSLA breaking on sigma-x and mentions several stock symbols again. This seems like another mixed sentiment tweet.
11. Eleventh tweet from marc faber discusses the importance of the markets not correcting 30% yet before TSLA could rise. So it's a positive statement because it's talking about potential growth, even though 30% correction is a significant concern.
12. Twelfth tweet reiterates that Google's stock is rising nearly 20%. Positive again.
13. Thirteenth tweet says the same as twelfth, so more positives.
14. Fourteenth tweet logs into a live stock chat with Google options and daytrading. Again, negative because it suggests losses.
15. Fifteenth tweet mentions where Google's self-driving cars might appear next, listing other companies but not Google.

Now, analyzing sentiment per tweet:

- Positive tweets: 1,3,4,7,8,9,12,13,14
- Negative tweets: 2,5,6,10,11

Total of 9 positive and 5 negative. The overall sentiment seems to lean towards positive since the majority is positive. However, there are several negative tweets that could indicate concerns about market conditions or potential risks. But given that multiple positive factors are present, especially around Google's performance, it leans more towards a positive impact.

So I should conclude with [Positive]."
2015-05-16,Neutral,"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a given company and determine if it should be classified as positive, neutral, or negative.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking through them, I see that tweet 8 mentions ""goog"", which makes me think this refers to Google's stock.

Now, I'll go through each tweet one by one:

1. **Tweet 1**: It mentions logging into an option millionaires live chat and talks about stocks like $ goog, $ aapl, etc. Not much info on Google here.
2. **Tweet 2**: Talks about a penny stock gaining 70% over the past week and mentions other companies. No mention of Google.
3. **Tweet 3**: Lists several ETFs and talks about trends. Again, no specific info on Google.
4. **Tweet 4**: Discusses trading tips from an AT_USER user, mentioning google, pcln, twtr, fb, aapl, ebay, gm, dust, baba. Hmm, ""pcln"" is not a known stock symbol, so this might be a typo or irrelevant.
5. **Tweet 5**: Talks about the cat caterpillar idea and mentions trends with $ cat, goog, vxx, dia. Not Google-related.
6. **Tweet 6**: References rytf guggenheim s & p 500 etf. Not relevant unless this is a typo for guggenheim, but it's unclear without more context.
7. **Tweet 7**: Discusses Tesla and talks about trends with $ tsla, goog, evlv, xbi. No mention of Google.
8. **Tweet 8**: Talks about class C market cap for google. This seems directly related to Google.

So, the main points are tweets 4,5,6,7,8 mention various ETFs and trends but not the stock symbol ""goog"" except tweet 8 which does. However, tweet 4 has ""pcln"", which I'm unsure about. 

Looking at the rest, they're all discussing ETFs and market trends without specific information on Google. The only tweet that mentions Google is tweet 8, which says it's in class C, a market cap. This could indicate growth potential but doesn't provide concrete details.

Since none of the tweets mention Google beyond what's stated (though one has a typo), and given the context about market trends and trends being positive, I think this overall sentiment might be neutral because there's no direct information on the stock itself or significant news affecting it. The trend suggests growth but without specifics on how that affects the price."
2015-05-17,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price. So, I have seven tweets here, each related to different companies. My task is to assess each one individually based on factors like positive or negative aspects, sentiment from the tweet, and then see how that affects investor perception.

Starting with the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER bosocial : stocknugget : helpful video for stock options beginners ! ! URL $ goog $ aapl $ googl $ am … URL"". Hmm, this seems to be a link or a reference. It looks like they're mentioning something related to Google. The presence of 'goog' in the URL suggests it's about Google products or services. They also mention ""stocknugget"" which sounds helpful for learning about stock options, but I'm not sure if that directly relates to stock prices.

Next tweet: ""rt AT_USER google chromebooks made by xolo , nexian launched for rs 12999 - the … URL google $ goog $ googl URL"". This one is talking about a product launch. Google has been making educational products for a long time, so this could be positive. They're launching something that helps students learn, which might attract more investors who are interested in education and tech. But I'm not sure if it's a big push.

Third tweet: ""rt AT_USER the changing us technology sector $ ibm $ msft $ aapl $ goog URL URL"". This is about the overall tech industry. The mention of ""changing"" suggests that the sector is evolving, which could be both positive and negative depending on context. I'm not entirely sure how this affects individual stocks or the company itself.

Fourth tweet: ""rosnerstocks : csco cisco systems , inc . summary click here -> URL trending $ csco $ fri $ goog $ … URL"". This seems like a financial summary about a company. They've listed it as trending, which might imply that people are watching their stock price movements. I'm not sure if this is positive or negative because it's just a link and the content isn't specified.

Fifth tweet: ""rt AT_USER this new version of google's self-driving car will hit the streets of … URL google $ goog $ googl URL"". This is about a new product, a self-driving car. While Google has been investing in AI and technology, specifically cars, it's unclear if that directly affects their stock price unless there's positive news or earnings. I can't tell enough to say for sure.

Sixth tweet: ""klxi klx inc . ideas click here -> URL trending $ klxi $ goog $ syn $ acwi klxi invest share"". This is a company name and its link to Google, as 'goog' is in the URL. It's suggesting that people are investing in Klxi, which might be a positive sign if they're considering stock growth or if they think it could benefit from Google's products.

Seventh tweet: ""lulu lululemon athletica filings click here -> URL trending $ lulu $ aapl $ goog $ gbgm lulu invest finance"". This is another company name linked to Google. Lulu is a sports brand, but their link doesn't seem directly related unless it's a typo or misrepresentation.

Now, considering each tweet:

1. The first tweet links them to Google products but doesn't specify if they're good or bad. It might be neutral since it's just a reference without sentiment details.
2. The second tweet is about a product launch by Google, which could attract investors interested in tech and education. Positive.
3. The third tweet is about the tech sector. Without specifics, it's hard to say if positive or negative. Maybe mixed.
4. The fourth tweet links to a company but doesn't provide sentiment details.
5. The fifth tweet talks about a self-driving car, which could be seen as positive investment in AI and technology. Positive.
6. The sixth tweet mentions Klxi, which isn't directly linked to Google unless it's part of the tech sector. It's unclear.
7. The seventh tweet links to Lulu, a sports brand, not related to Google.

Looking at all tweets, the ones that talk about Google (tweets 2, 4, 5, 6) seem positive or mixed because they attract investors interested in tech and/or education. Tweets 1, 3, 7 don't provide enough info on their impact.

So overall sentiment seems positive since several tweets are pointing towards positive aspects like tech companies and educational products."
2015-05-18,Negative,"Alright, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a given company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I have to figure out what each tweet is about. The target stock isn't specified here, but looking at the tweets, they seem related to tech companies and financial indicators like market cap, stock prices, and specific symbols. 

Looking at tweet 1: ""clayton_dd : ibb biotech ishares market cap click here -> URL trending $ ibb $ goog $ dskx $ aria … URL"" Hmm, this seems to mention IBB and Googling. Maybe it's about tech trends or stock info. The words like ""trending"" might indicate a positive or neutral impact.

Tweet 2: ""the future is mobile ( and apps ) , except that it isn't URL $ fb $ twtr $ goog $ googl."" This is talking about mobile and apps, but the text cuts off after ""it isn't"". It seems like it's probably discussing something else related to tech trends or mobile trends.

Tweet 3: ""find active and helpful professional daytraders stock traders here URL $ goog $ aapl $ qqq URL"" Here, the tweet mentions Google and Apple. Professional traders are mentioned, which might suggest growth in the tech sector, possibly positive.

Tweet 4: ""arni arno therapeutics , inc . current price click here -> URL trending $ arni $ grub $ v $ goog arni invest …"" This one is about Anri and Grub, with a focus on stock prices. It looks like it's providing details about a company or their financials.

Tweet 5: ""goog google inc . - class c day high click here -> URL trending $ goog $ yelp $ mdt $ avxl goog invest invest"" This is more about Google's performance, specifically its stock price and some other metrics. High on the stock could indicate positive sentiment.

Tweet 6: ""pbr petroleo brasileiro ( petrobras ) p / e ratio click here -> URL trending $ pbr $ exel $ ugaz $ goog pbr stocks stock"" This tweet is about PBR Petroleo and their financials, specifically the PE ratio. A higher PE ratio could indicate concerns or potential issues.

Tweet 7: ""rt AT_USER google wants in as e-commerce continues to build $ goog URL URL"" It's talking about Google wanting to expand into e-commerce. Positive expansion in tech areas can boost the company's image and stock price.

Tweet 8: ""ihnewsdesk : goog google inc . - class a market cap click here -> URL trending $ goog $ xiv $ ttp … URL"" This is similar to tweet 2, about Google's market position or trends.

Tweet 9: ""de deere & co . ask click here -> URL trending $ de $ mdcn $ ziop $ goog de stock share"" It mentions Deere and their stock. If they are expanding into tech, it might be positive.

Tweet 10: ""bosocial : bossocial : bosocial : bossocial : chewytrader : stock on watch $ ubqu $ fb $ goog $ aapl and $ hjoe … URL"" This seems to list multiple companies, including Google. If many tech companies are mentioned on the platform where these tweets happen, it might indicate broader tech activity.

Putting it all together, several tweets focus on Google (GOOG) or other tech-related companies with mentions of market trends, stock prices, and expansion into new areas like e-commerce or technology itself. The positive aspects include comments about expanding into e-commerce, a strong Google stock price trend, and investment mentions which can sometimes indicate investor sentiment.

However, the fact that several tweets mention PBR and petroleo (Petroleum) could indicate concerns related to environmental issues or industry-specific news, which might be negative for a company. Plus, if multiple tech companies are being discussed in different tweets, it might lead to a broader tech sector outlook, which is typically positive but depends on the specifics.

In the end, while there's a lot of positive mentions about expansion and Google performance, the environmental concerns from PBR could have mixed effects. But overall, considering all these factors, I think the sentiment leans towards neutral because there are both positive and negative points contributing."
2015-05-19,Negative,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided two specific tweets and wants me to figure out if they'll be positive, neutral, or negative for the stock's future price.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""fls flowserve corp investor opinions click here -> URL trending $ fls $ goog $ rsp $ ibm fls stocks share"". The words ""trending,"" ""goog"", and "" rsp"" might indicate some positive trends related to Google. But the word ""fpls stock shares"" could be referring to something else, maybe from a different company. I'm not sure about the sentiment here—maybe it's a bit uncertain since it mentions stocks but without context on what's going on.

The second tweet is: ""apple shelved plans to introduce tv set more than a year ago - wsj : URL $ aapl $ goog $ pcln $ k"". This one seems negative. Apple introducing a TV set (which I think might be an issue with their product, maybe in the car or something) could have negative implications on their stock price. The mention of WSJ and other companies like CloudPoint (pcln) suggests they're part of a larger market.

Considering these, the first tweet is partially positive because it's linked to Google, but the second is definitely negative due to the product issue. So overall, I think there's some positive note from the stock mentioned but clearly a significant negative impact elsewhere. Maybe overall sentiment leans towards neutral? Or perhaps more negative given the strong mention of Google."
2015-05-20,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about the stock price impact on Google's future value. 

First, I need to extract the target stock from each tweet. I'll look for names like ""goog"" or other company names that are significant in financial discussions. 

Looking at the tweets:

1. The first tweet mentions ""carl icahn thinks apple is worth $240."" Apple isn't directly related to Google, but it's a well-known stock. 

2. The second tweet talks about relative volume on NASDAQ and SPDR S&P 500 Index ETF. Volume can indicate market sentiment, which might affect prices.

3. Tweet 3 discusses a thread from iyt regarding DJIA. Again, DJIA is an index, so it's not specific to Google, but it's related to the broader stock market.

4. Tweet 4 mentions enzn trading on NASDAQ. Not directly linked to Google either.

5. The last tweet talks about Microsoft making strides in cloud technology with Google. This seems like a positive angle because it shows potential growth or partnership.

Now, evaluating each tweet for factors and sentiment:

1. Apple: While not a direct factor, icahn's comment might influence investor expectations if it affects demand or earnings. However, since it's just ""apple"" without specifics, it's less clear.

2. Volume on NASDAQ: High volume often indicates strong market interest or news, which can boost prices but may also lead to overvaluation.

3. DJIA posts: Again, not a direct factor for Google. The thread might discuss the broader market, affecting stock price, but I'm not certain if it's positive or negative without more context.

4. enzn trading on NASDAQ: Trading activity could indicate investor sentiment, but specifics aren't given, making it hard to assess impact on stock.

5. Microsoft in cloud tech with Google: This seems like a strategic move showing potential future growth, which is positive for investors willing to pay for cloud services from Google.

Overall, while there's an implied connection through Microsoft and Google's partnership, the other tweets don't provide concrete information about Google's performance or fundamentals. Volume alone can indicate sentiment, but without context, it's hard to determine if the impact will be positive or negative. The main positive point is Microsoft's move, but that doesn't directly address Google's stock price."
2015-05-21,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and figure out how they impact the stock price of a company. The user provided some tweets with symbols like LRCX, SPY, QQQ, etc., so I'll focus on one specific company's tweets for this analysis.

Let me start by reading through each tweet carefully.

1. ""bosocial : bosocial : jotaibi 61 : $ lrcx put $ spy $ qqq $ aapl $ googl $ goog $ twtr $ fb $ baba $ pcln $ tsla $ bidu $ amzn $ msf … URL""
   - This seems like a link to other stocks, but I don't have the stock symbol here. Maybe it's about tech or something else.

2. ""$ goog - why URL inc isn't scared of google inc's "" buy "" button URL""
   - Here, ""Google Inc."" is mentioned, so maybe this is about Google. The tweet says they're not scared, which could mean investors are positive towards them.

3. ""google wants you to buy things straight from youtube videos $ goog URL""
   - Again, Google is mentioned here. It says they're buying directly from YouTube, which might imply good news or a strategic decision, possibly positive for the stock.

4. ""will $ goog lose ad revenue to the apps as the world continues it's shift toward mobile devices ? AT_USER research . URL""
   - This tweet suggests that Google's advertising revenue is going down because of apps moving towards mobile devices. If ad revenue drops, that could negatively impact their earnings, which might lead investors to be more cautious.

5. ""rt $ qqq algos triggered sell in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 15:50 , p / t 108.50 $ goog $ twtr $ bidu $ gpro $ nflx $ aapl $ fb $ tsla hft quant""
   - ""RT"" probably stands for RTX or RTX (the RTX token). The tweet mentions sell orders in various platforms like sigma-x and crossfinder, which could be about stock options or other derivatives. If these platforms are selling stocks, it might affect Google's price via option chains, but I'm not sure.

6. ""celg celgene corp . quotes click here -> URL trending $ celg $ blue $ bidu $ goog celg investing nasdaq""
   - This seems to be about Celgene. They mention their stock is trending and investing in the NASDAQ. If they're taking a positive action, maybe investors are positive.

7. ""AT_USER ( $ goog ): many users turn to youtube for explainer videos URL""
   - More Google mentions here. Users turning to YouTube for explainer videos could indicate improved user experience or content quality, which might be good news for Google's stock.

8. ""rt AT_USER $ baba , $ yhoo , $ amzn , $ goog risks for alibaba , yahoo and internet stocks ? bernstein just laid them … URL ~ …""
   - This tweet is about risks associated with certain stocks: Alibaba, YHOO, AMZN, GOOG. It seems like Bernstein is highlighting the risks for these companies. If there are risks involved, it might negatively impact Google's stock.

9. ""goog google inc . - class c tick click here -> URL trending $ goog $ bac $ tsl $ tsl goog stocks pennystocks""
   - Another Google tweet about their stock performance and a link to pennystocks. It's unclear what this is about, but maybe it's positive news related to Google.

10. ""AT_USER $ goog are google's golden days over as the world goes mobile ? URL""

These tweets seem to be mixed in terms of content. Many discuss Google (GOOG), YHOO, AMZN, and other tech companies. There's no single stock symbol provided here, which complicates things because I don't know what company we're looking at.

Looking for a pattern: Some tweets are positive about Google's actions or user behavior, like users turning to YouTube. Others discuss declines in ad revenue due to app shifts towards mobile devices. There's also mention ofCelgene and alibaba, which could relate to their sectors or strategies.

Without the specific stock, I can't know for sure how each tweet affects a particular company. If this is about Google Inc., then positive tweets about YouTube might be good, negative ones from ad revenue losses would matter. The Celgene tweet could be about another company entirely.

I think the best approach is to assume that these are all related to different companies or sectors but tied closely to Google, YHOO, AMZN, and others. Without more context, it's hard to give a precise sentiment for one specific stock. Maybe the user wants this in general terms rather than focusing on one company.

So, considering all the tweets, there's a mix of positive actions like YouTube support and negative ones about ad revenue and risks. This could lead to uncertainty about the overall impact, possibly neutral or mixed."
2015-05-22,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided specific tweets related to stocks like Apple (AAPL), Amazon, Google, etc., and they want me to assess each one as either positive, neutral, or negative.

First, let me go through each tweet step by step. I'll identify which stocks are mentioned because that's the target stock symbol. If a stock isn't listed in any of the tweets, it might be ignored for this analysis. 

Looking at the first tweet: ""toptickertweets $ aapl $ fb $ spy $ isr $ goog $ aveo $ baba $ pbmd $ twtr $ bbry sentiquant 2015052 2 09:25 : 04:653"". It mentions several stocks but doesn't specify which one. Similarly, the other tweets mention multiple companies each time.

The user also provided output requirements where I need to conclude with ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"" and use exactly those tags. Since some tweets are about multiple stocks (like tweet 2), I might have to choose which stock's sentiment is being expressed. But without knowing which stock the user is referring to, this can be tricky.

I think in such cases, the overall sentiment could be considered positive if there's a lack of negative news or mentions that indicate improvement for any of the stocks involved. However, since each tweet might target different stocks, it's impossible to know exactly which one's sentiment is being expressed. 

Therefore, I can't give a specific sentiment label for each stock based on this data alone because the information isn't tied to a single company. It seems like multiple companies are mentioned across various tweets, making it hard to determine the overall impact without more context.

But since the user asked me to conclude with one of those three labels and provided examples, I think in this case, there's no specific stock to evaluate unless I have to assume which stock is being referred to. Perhaps the tweet about Apple's new store data could indicate a positive outlook for their shares, so maybe Apple is considered here.

Alternatively, if all the tweets are promoting companies that the user is interested in (like certain stocks), but it's unclear without knowing the specific target. So, maybe I should assume the general market sentiment based on overall information.

Wait, looking again, some tweets mention positive changes like launch announcements or improving store data, which could be seen as positive for their respective stocks. But without knowing which company is being referred to in each tweet, it's impossible to assess each one individually.

So, I think the best approach is to inform that based on the provided information, the overall sentiment can't be determined because multiple stocks are mentioned across different tweets. However, if I had to choose a stock, say Apple (AAPL), which has many positive news points like earnings reports or product launches, it might have a positive impact.

But since each tweet is about different stocks, maybe the user expects me to select one and apply a label based on that. For example, if one tweet mentions Google's recent success with its new product, that could be positive for GOGGL (Google).

In conclusion, without knowing which stock the user is referring to in these tweets, I can't assign a specific sentiment label like [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. It might require more context or specifying which company to evaluate."
2015-05-23,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether these tweets are going to positively impact the stock price of a company based on the provided information.

Looking at the first tweet, it mentions $ goog over a 130% boost in prize money. That sounds like positive news because more money could encourage investors. But I also see other mentions of $ goog being used in URLs for investing and financial companies. This makes me question if all those are related to the stock or just examples.

The second tweet is all about bosocial, which doesn't seem directly tied to the stock mentioned. It's a bit confusing because it includes a lot of words but nothing clear about the company's stock performance.

Third tweet mentions $ ewy and several other stocks, so again, unclear unless there's more context on which stock we're talking about.

Fourth tweet brings up brwc, twtr, hyg, and goog. Brwc is mentioned in another tweet, but I don't know if that's the same company or not. The fact that goog is involved might indicate positive sentiment since it's a well-known company with a strong track record.

Fifth tweet talks about amzn, mcox, goog. AmZN is a big stock, and goog being mentioned here could be significant because it's a major player in the tech industry, so a 3300% increase over 7 months sounds huge for investors.

Sixth tweet mentions eltp and intc, which are pharmaceutical companies. While that might impact their specific stocks, I don't have direct information on how this would affect another company unless there's an overlap or context about the stock being discussed.

Seventh tweet is from rt user, mentioning ibm and goog. Ibm is a well-known technology company, so if they're investing in it based on the user's insights, that could be positive news.

Eighth tweet talks about making a portfolio of media companies, which again doesn't directly tie into the stock mentioned, unless there's an assumption that the same stocks are being discussed.

Putting this together, several tweets mention goog or other tech companies like amzn and ibm. Google has strong earnings reports historically, and these increases in their stock could be positive signs for investors. The user engagement mentions a rise in platinum members investing on $ thcz, which suggests active trading among readers. Additionally, mentions of other tech stocks as examples might indicate broader interest or trust in the company.

Therefore, considering the positive elements like increased prize money from goog, notable earnings growth, and mentions of media companies, it seems likely that these tweets are contributing to a positive sentiment towards the stock."
2015-05-24,Positive,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price. So, the user provided two tweets about penny stocks with some metrics mentioned, like 570% gain for Amazon and 3300% gain for another stock in a month.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. The first tweet mentions 'platinum members', but that might be referring to a specific group of users rather than an actual stock symbol. The second tweet has 'erbb' and 'bbda', which I'm not sure about those abbreviations. Maybe they're referring to specific stocks or something else.

Assuming that 'bbda' could stand for something, perhaps a stock like Apple (AAPL) or Microsoft (MSFT). Similarly, 'erbb' might be another stock. Without knowing the exact symbols, it's hard to pinpoint the stocks, but I can still analyze the overall sentiment based on the metrics given.

Amazon is known for its growth over time, especially since they've been expanding into new markets and tech sectors. A 570% gain seems quite significant and positive. That would probably push the stock price up, which is a good sign for investors looking for growth stocks.

The second tweet has a much higher gain of 3300%, which is a huge increase. I know Apple has been going strong, especially with their recent acquisitions and increasing dividends. An 85% increase in a month suggests massive growth potential, definitely positive.

Considering both tweets mention significant gains, the overall sentiment is likely positive for the stock price."
2015-05-25,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about Google's stock price impact. So, first, I need to go through each tweet and see what they're saying about Google.

Starting with the first tweet: ""morningstar gives aa credit rating to google $ goog url"". That sounds positive because it's giving a credit rating, which suggests good news for investors. Positive factors are here.

The second tweet is more general: ""track trending assets in 1 watchlist $ bse sensex $ twtr $ usdjpy $ goog url"". It mentions multiple stock prices but isn't specific about Google. The fact that they're tracking assets and giving Google a URL indicates they're checking the company, so positive for investors who care about their portfolio.

Third tweet: ""goog google inc . - class c day high URL $ goog $ iyr $ asgn $ bns.to goog finance tradeideasgpro gopro , inc . p / e …"". The ""class c day high"" part seems like an earnings announcement, which is a positive sign for investors. They're also mentioning technical indicators like payoff diagrams and P/E ratio, which are important to investors. So, this adds to the overall positive sentiment.

Fourth tweet: ""goog google inc . - class a change URL $ goog $ sina $ amat $ uso goog nasdaq tradeideasgoogl gopro , inc . prev close …"". Similar to the third tweet, it's another earnings announcement from Google. The ""class a"" might indicate that they're signaling improvements, which is positive for investors.

Fifth tweet: ""rt optionstraining video : payoff diagrams URL $ goog $ googl $ tsls $ tqqq $ xlv $ xnrg $ nke $ di … URL"". This one mentions options trading and payoff diagrams. The use of options and specific stocks like TSLA and QQQ could be a bit risky, but I don't see any explicit positive or negative news related to Google. It seems more about investor behavior than company performance.

Sixth tweet: ""free video tutorial psychology of trading URL $ tlt $ tna $ qqq $ spy $ gpro $ goog $ aapl URL"". Again, it's a tutorial on trading and mentions various stocks but doesn't provide direct information about Google. The mention of PSY and APL might be about market conditions or trends that aren't specific to the company.

Seventh tweet: ""ddd 3d systems corp . ask size URL $ ddd $ tck / b.to $ tlt $ goog ddd stockmarket invest"". This is about DDD, a different company. No information related to Google here, so this tweet isn't relevant to assessing Google's stock performance.

Eighth tweet: ""goog google inc . - class c quotes URL $ goog $ enb.to $ hnd.to $ hnd.to goog stock investing"". Another positive point about Google with the ""class c"" again, indicating they're signaling good news. The mention of ""stock investing"" might be encouraging potential investors to engage with Google.

Now, let's summarize the factors and sentiments. The first tweet is definitely positive for investors. The second mentions a portfolio check but doesn't specify Google. The third and fourth tweets are about earnings announcements, which are strong signals for stock prices. The fifth tweet is more speculative but could be seen as neutral because it's about trading strategies rather than company performance.

However, the last three tweets don't mention Google at all, so they might not have a significant impact on the stock price. So overall, there are four positive factors and one negative (the fifth tweet), which should result in a positive overall sentiment."
2015-05-26,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of Blum Bank of Montreal. 

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet, ""blcm bank of montreal investor opinions URL $ blcm $ abc $ goog $ nvet blcm pennystocks pennystocks,"" it seems like ""blcm"" might be the symbol for Blum Bank of Montreal. But I'm not entirely sure if that's accurate. Maybe there are multiple symbols or perhaps some typos in the text.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one and extract the relevant information. For example, the second tweet mentions a user saying Google will acquire Twitter on par with Paraguay, which could be interesting information but not directly related to Blum Bank's stock price.

I notice that many tweets discuss stock trading strategies or news about the company. These types of tweets often indicate investor sentiment towards the stock without providing direct financial data. However, they can show trends in the market and potential future actions by investors.

Some tweets have numbers indicating class C stocks with specific metrics, like market cap. While this provides information about the stock's performance relative to others, it doesn't impact the overall price unless the metrics are positive or negative indicators.

I should also consider any newsworthy events or news that might mention Blum Bank of Montreal. For instance, if a tweet mentions the company improving its financials or expanding into new markets, that could boost confidence and affect stock prices.

Looking at each tweet, I see mentions like ""Google will acquire Twitter on par with Paraguay,"" which seems unrelated unless it's a typo or misrepresentation. Similarly, other tweets mention Alibaba's comeback, solar tech news, finance-related stories, and other stocks but not specifically about Blum Bank of Montreal.

Considering all these factors—whether the information is positive, negative, or neutral—I realize that most tweets are supporting stock trading strategies rather than providing direct financial data. This suggests a more cautious outlook on the stock price, possibly leaning towards [Neutral] because the information isn't strong enough to significantly impact confidence."
2015-05-27,Negative,"Alright, let me figure out how to determine the overall impact on the stock price based on these tweets about Google. So, first, I need to identify each tweet and extract the target stock symbol. Looking at the list, it seems like the main stock mentioned is ""goog"". 

Now, for each tweet, I have to look into whether they're positive, negative, or neutral regarding Google. Let's go through them one by one.

1. The first tweet says: ""rt AT_USER the 10 most valuable brands in the world $ goog $ aapl $ msft $ ibm $ v $ t $ vzc $ ko $ mcd URL URL"". Hmm, it mentions various companies but doesn't specify Google's position relative to others. So maybe this is neutral.

2. The second tweet: ""bi_retailnews : the 10 most valuable brands in the world $ goog $ aapl $ msft $ ibm $ v $ t $ vzc $ ko $ mcd … URL"". Again, similar structure without mentioning Google's position.

3. Third tweet is similar to the first one but repeats URLs, so probably neutral again because it doesn't provide specific info about Google.

4. Fourth tweet: ""rt $ aapl $ amzn $ baba $ bidu $ celg $ cvx $ fb $ fslr $ gild $ gld $ gmcr $ goog $ googl $ gpro $ gs $ hpq $ iwm … URL"". Here, they mention goog and others but the focus is on GM's financials. If GM is doing well, that could be positive.

5. Fifth tweet: ""google inc android m stands for - URL $ goog URL"" – this seems to suggest negative news about Google's revenue or future prospects, which would likely impact the stock negatively.

6. Sixth tweet is a bit unclear: ""google inc android m stands for - URL $ goog URL"". Maybe it's similar to the fifth one, negative info on Google's future.

7. Seventh tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ vuzi buy . $ insy buy . kindfinance • • • stocks money trading $ fb $ twtr $ tsla $ gwph $ msft $ goog $ amzn $ baba $ fnma"". Here, there are mentions of other companies but no explicit mention of Google. Could be neutral.

8. Eighth tweet: ""goog - gm to offer android auto and apple carplay on chevrolets URL"" – talking about GM's products or GM's actions related to Chevolets, which is a car company. If GM is doing well, that could affect Google's stock positively if they're in the same industry.

9. Ninth tweet: ""rt AT_USER baba alibaba group holding ltd . stock message board URL $ baba $ goog $ dig $ fv baba stocks investing"" – mentions BABA and GOOG, which are related companies. This seems like a positive sign as related companies might indicate better economic conditions or investor sentiment.

10. Tenth tweet: ""find your own trading path . $ mat $ tsm $ iwm $ pfe $ goog $ aapl $ drc $ lvs $ cl $ wtw $ apc $ gdx URL URL"" – mentions GM and GOOG but doesn't specify Google's actions or sentiment.

11. Eleventh tweet: ""rt AT_USER rt rt rt rt google , yahoo have had talks to buy flipboard $ googl $ yhoo $ twtr $ goog URL … … … URL"" – talking about Google buying Flipboard, which is a technology stock. If the acquisition leads to better earnings or innovation, that could be positive.

12. Twelfth tweet: ""rt rt rt rt rt rt rt rt rt google , yahoo have had talks to buy flipboard $ googl $ yhoo $ twtr $ goog … … … URL"" – similar structure as the eleventh but again without Google's position in context.

13. Thirteenth tweet: ""$ goog - has google , inc solved its mobile advertising problem ? URL"" – here, there's a question about Google solving an issue. If this is done well and leads to improved revenue, it could be positive.

Now, compiling the sentiments from these tweets:

- Positive tweets: 4th, 8th, 9th, 11th
- Negative tweets: 5th, 6th (though they are similar)
- Neutral: 1st, 2nd, 3rd

But looking at each positive tweet, most of them talk about GM's financials and other related companies. If GM is performing well in these areas, it could positively impact Google's stock. The fourth tweet mentions GOOG Lumps, which I'm not sure about. The eighth tweet talks about GM as part of a deal, so that could be positive too.

However, the fifth and sixth tweets are all negative regarding Google's future prospects. That seems like a strong negative indicator.

So overall, there are both positive and negative tweets. Positive tweets might indicate a possible improvement or new opportunities in related companies, but the significant negative tweet about GM suggests Google is facing challenges that could negatively affect its stock price."
2015-05-28,Negative,"Alright, let's try to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the company in question. First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking through each tweet, it seems like all of them mention ""goog,"" so I think the target stock is Google.

Now, going through each tweet one by one:

1. The first tweet talks about Google revealing a new Android pay system and services.
2. The second mentions Facebook's (FB) changes in their percentage change.
3. This third tweet also discusses related services Google introduced.
4. Tweet 4 says that Google has been sanctioned by FIFA and President Volodymyr Ulyanov at the same time, which seems like a significant event affecting investor sentiment.
5. Tweet 5 mentions IBM's stock performance, which is in the tech sector but not directly Google.
6. Tweet 6 is about FCX's stock price change relative to Google.
7. Tweet 7 discusses Facebook hacking and tracking users, affecting another company.
8. Tweet 8 talks about CVC's (Cost Variance) stock on Wall Street.
9. Tweet 9 mentions the US DJIA index and relates to Google's stock.
10. Tweet 10 talks about a new post about Google's competition, perhaps with Rick Spector.
11. Tweet 11 discusses AT_USER's comment about Google introducing Android services again.
12. Tweet 12 is about CERN's stock changes relative to Google.
13. Tweet 13 just repeats $ goog, which I assume refers back to Google.
14. Tweet 14 talks about volatility in payoff diagrams for stock options related to Google and others.
15. Tweet 15 mentions TSLA (Tech Streetlight) partnership with Google, impacting another tech company but not Google itself.
16. Tweet 16 discusses IBM's stock again, as it was mentioned before.
17. Tweet 17 is a bit vague about the cable industry trying to stave off an inevitable situation.
18. Tweet 18 reports Google's stock performance with a small drop.

Now, analyzing each tweet: most of them are either positive or neutral in nature. Tweets like 3 and 9 talk about developments that could impact other companies but not Google directly. Tweet 4 mentions sanctions on FIFA and President Ulyanov, which is likely to affect investors negatively as it's a significant event impacting the game industry.

However, tweet 16 talks about IBM stock, which isn't related to Google. Similarly, tweets 5, 7, 9, etc., mention different companies but not Google. Only tweets 3 and 4 are about other areas, so they're more speculative in terms of affecting Google's stock. The most significant negative tweet is number 18 with a slight drop.

Considering all the positive and neutral tweets, especially number 18's minor loss, it leans towards a [Negative] sentiment overall."
2015-05-29,Positive,"Alright, I need to determine the likely impact on the stock price of the company based on these tweets. Let's take each tweet one by one and analyze their factors and sentiment.

1. **tweet 1**: ""look at this nke $ mine $ vpor $ goog $ erbb url"". Hmm, it mentions a URL without much information about the stock or any positive or negative claims.
2. **tweet 2**: ""jmei jumei international holding ltd . e . p . s . url $ jmei $ hal $ goog $ brcm jmei investing finance"". This one has some technical terms and mentions investors, but I can't extract the stock symbol or find anything positive or negative.
3. **tweet 3**: ""what google inc just announced is a bombshell that could radically change the ... $ goog url"". Here, it's clearly stating something significant about Google. A bombshell usually hints at potential changes, so this looks like a positive signal.
4. **tweet 4**: ""bidu baidu , inc . p / e ratio URL $ bidu $ hnr $ goog $ goog bidu pennystocks pennystocks"". This tweet mentions the P/E ratio and links to pennystocks, which might imply stock performance, but not sure if it's positive or negative.
5. **tweet 5**: ""cree cree , inc . chart URL $ Cree $ goog $_espr $ ddd Cree share tradeideas"". The mention of a chart could indicate investor interest or analysis, so it's likely positive.
6. **tweet 6**: ""the at_user gmail email service tops 900 million global users $ goog, $ aapl, $ yhoo url URL"". This is about the number of users on Google and other companies, but not directly related to any stock mentioned.
7. **tweet 7**: ""at_user $ goog your tweet has been featured on market parse , for iphone . url"" again, it's just stating a link without any positive or negative info.
8. **tweet 8**: ""rt at_user logging into option millionaires live chat now ! url $ goog $ aapl $ vix stocks daytraders url"". This seems like customer interaction, but no stock information, so not helpful for sentiment analysis.
9. **tweet 9**: ""rt at_user google dumps car new gtld domain , what does that tell you ? googlecar $ goog url icann google"". Another user-related tweet without any stock details or claims, so it's likely neutral or not providing sentiment data.
10. **tweet 10**: ""logging in now to live stock chat url $ goog $ aapl $ fb $ ebay options stocks daytrading url"". Again, user interaction without specific stock information.
11. **tweet 11**: ""rt at_user google's photos app offers free , unlimited cloud storage of photos and videos : url $ goog url"". A direct link to Google's product feature, which is positive as it might indicate support or interest in the company.
12. **tweet 12**: ""rt at_user google's photos app offers free , unlimited cloud storage of photos and videos : url $ goog url"" – same as tweet 11.

So, out of these, only tweets 3 and 11 are directly about Google stock or related products. Tweet 3 mentions a bombshell that could change things positively. Tweet 11 talks about the company's product offering, which is positive for investor sentiment. The rest don't provide enough information to assess sentiment.

Therefore, both positive factors point towards a possible increase in stock price. So overall, it's likely a Positive."
2015-05-30,Neutral,"Okay, let me try to figure out the impact of these tweets on GROPO's stock price. I need to analyze each tweet and see if they contribute positively, neutrally, or negatively.

First tweet: ""rt rt rt rt can gopro build an ecosystem as strong as apple ’ s ? - $ gpro $ goog $ googl $ amzn $ aapl $ bcs $ barc by mjon … URL"". Hmm, it's about building an ecosystem similar to Apple. I'm not sure what that means in terms of stock performance, but building something similar could be seen as a positive move for their tech-related products.

Second tweet: ""nbix neurocrine biosciences , inc . market cap URL $ nbix $ goog $ ng.to $ nmbl nbix tradeideas investing"". This one mentions neurocrine and their market cap. Neurocrine is a company I know is involved in biosecurity, which relates to tech. If it's a leading company, it might be seen as a positive sign for the tech sector overall, which could positively impact GROPO.

Third tweet: ""logging into option millionaires live chat now ! URL $ goog $ aapl $ vix stocks daytraders URL"". This is about trading options and stock selections. It doesn't directly mention any positive or negative company news, so maybe it's more of a neutral response to market movements rather than influencing the stock price.

Putting it all together, while the first tweet has a positive note about building an ecosystem related to Apple, which can indicate growth in tech companies, the second tweet talks about neurocrine, a tech-related company. The third is more speculative and not directly affecting GROPO's performance. So overall, there might be some positive sentiment, but it's not clear if it's strong enough for a clear conclusion."
2015-05-31,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided a set of tweets and asked for an analysis of their impact on the future stock price of a given company. They've specified that I need to identify the stock symbol from the tweets, analyze each tweet in terms of factors (positive or negative) and sentiment, then combine them into an overall sentiment.

First, I'll start by extracting the stock symbol from each tweet. Looking through the tweets, the first one mentions ""goog,"" which is a common abbreviation for Google. The other tweets also seem to be related to stock symbols like ""msft"" (MSFT), ""gsm,"" etc., but they're all about different companies or topics. This might make it tricky because some of these could refer to unrelated stocks.

Next, I need to break down each tweet into positive and negative factors. For example, tweet 1 mentions a sentiment score of 5, which is high, so that's a strong positive factor for Google. Similarly, other tweets can be labeled as positive or negative based on their content.

Then, I have to assess the sentiment of each tweet. Sentiment affects how investors view the stock, influencing market movements. For instance, if a tweet from an investee mentions a profit increase (positive), it could boost investor confidence. Conversely, negative tweets might suggest potential issues affecting the company's performance.

Combining all these elements will give me an overall sentiment for each tweet and then the overall impact on Google. I need to ensure that my analysis is comprehensive but clear, sticking strictly to the tags: Positive, Neutral, or Negative without any fluff.

Finally, I'll write a conclusion summarizing the overall sentiment based on the combined data from all tweets provided."
2015-06-01,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their likely impact on the stock price of a company. Let me start by identifying the target stock from each tweet.

Looking at the first tweet: ""fxi ishares ftse china 25 index fund bid size URL $ fxi $ goog $ uup $ axp fxi share share"". Hmm, this seems to be talking about an investment product called fxi ishares. The words mentioned are related to stocks and indices, but without specific context or a stock symbol, it's hard to pinpoint the company. Maybe I should check if ""fxi"" is a known stock or part of a larger company.

The second tweet: ""$ goog $ aapl $ twtr monday morning reads 6/1 / 15 - update from option millionaires - stock options chatroom welcome t ... URL"". This one seems to be discussing Google (GOOG) as well. The mention of ""millionaires"" and ""stock options chatroom"" suggests it's related to tech companies, specifically Apple or Microsoft.

Third tweet: ""dust velocityshares 3x inverse crude etn short sales URL $ dust $ admd $ goog $ ashr dust share pennystocks"". Again, this is talking about Dust (DUST) and VelocityShares. The terms like ""inverse crude"" and ""etn"" indicate it's related to energy or commodities.

Fourth tweet: ""rt AT_USER . AT_USER to announce $ 300m + data center expansion in douglas county URL $. goog tech jobs URL"". This seems to be announcing a major project, specifically expanding data centers in Douglas County. It mentions the company doing something significant, which could boost their earnings and stock price.

Fifth tweet: ""$ goog URL job seekers : what you can do if the hiring process seems to have stalled URL"". This is addressing potential issues with the hiring process at Google. If the process isn't working as expected, it might affect employees and possibly limit revenue, impacting the company's performance.

Sixth tweet: ""goog google inc . - class c filings URL $ goog $ aria $ dal $ mfc.to goog stock pennystocks"". Again, Google is mentioned with references to filings. This could indicate that Google has regulatory filings or news related to their operations.

Now, I need to assess each tweet for factors and sentiment. The first tweet mentions fxi shares, which might be part of a company, possibly related to tech or energy. The second tweet discusses Google stock. The third tweet talks about Dust, another possible tech company. Fourth and fifth tweets are announcements from Google, while the sixth is more about Google's filings.

Overall, several tweets are directly mentioning Google (GOOG) and other tech companies like Apple or others. Since they're making business-related announcements, especially around expansion projects, earnings, and company news, this could positively impact the stock price by increasing investor confidence in their future performance."
2015-06-02,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the future stock price of the company pennystocks. Let me break down each tweet step by step.

First, the target stock is ""pennystocks"". So I need to look for any mentions or references in the tweets that relate to this company.

Looking at tweet 1: It talks about ddd systems and mentions goog and snak. No direct mention of pennystocks here.

Tweet 2: Glw corning inc., which is a different company, not related to pennystocks either.

Tweet 3: Introduces a charting tool but again, nothing specific about pennystocks.

Tweet 4: Vlo valero energy corp. Another unrelated company. No pennystocks here.

Tweet 5: Talks about goog inc.'s i/o conference recap. That's about Google, not pennystocks.

Tweet 6: google google inc. - class c open. Again, focused on Google, not pennystocks.

Tweet 7: Regi guggenheim s & p 500 equal weight consumer staples etf yield URL. This discusses Guggenheim and something about P.S.P. stocks. It seems like it's a strategy or investment topic related to consumer staples, which could influence the stock market but not necessarily pennystocks.

Tweet 8: goog google inc. - class c dividend. Similar structure as tweet 6, focusing on Google dividends. No direct link to pennystocks either.

So, after analyzing all tweets, none of them mention or directly relate to pennystocks. The focus is more on other companies and related topics like the Guggenheim index, which might be a different sector or ETF. Therefore, it seems there's no clear positive, negative, or neutral impact on pennystocks based on these tweets.

I think the overall sentiment here is neutral because there's no indication of any positive or negative information affecting pennystocks."
2015-06-03,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me take each tweet one by one and analyze them step by step.

Starting with the first tweet: ""AT_USER your tweet about $ goog had a sentiment of 1 and was featured on market parse . URL"". Hmm, this looks like it's directing attention to another tweet or maybe adding more context. The word ""featured"" suggests that someone is highlighting it for further discussion, which could be positive as it might attract more views or engagement.

The second tweet: ""our stock alerts gained over 1300 % in less than 3 months ! see our new picks : URL $ dpm $ frak $ goog"". This seems like a positive statement. The user is saying their stock performance has improved significantly, which usually can boost investor confidence. They're giving updates on new stock picks and directing the reader to specific URLs.

The third tweet: ""it's time to get into this stock : URL $ goog $ aapl"". This looks like an invitation or a call to action. The word ""get"" might be indicating that someone is encouraging investors to take action, which can be seen as positive because it promotes further engagement and possibly more purchases.

The fourth tweet: ""our penny stock pick on $ thcz is up 570.77 % for platinum members ! big update : URL $ ibm $ goog $ aapl"". Similar to the second tweet, this seems positive. The user is highlighting a penny stock that's performing exceptionally well. It's likely boosting investor interest and giving more information about it.

Putting it all together, each tweet seems to be promoting the stock in some way—either by encouraging more attention via an invitation, providing detailed updates on performance, or just reinforcing the idea that there's good news coming. These signals are positive because they're directing people towards further discussion, which can increase trading activity and potentially drive the stock price up.

So, overall, these tweets seem to be signaling positive movements in the stock, either by promoting it directly or indirectly through other indicators."
2015-06-04,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this analysis. The user has provided five tweets and wants to determine their impact on the stock price of a given company. They also gave specific instructions on how to analyze each tweet: first by identifying the target stock symbol, then breaking down each tweet into positive and negative factors, assessing the sentiment, and finally summarizing the overall sentiment.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at them:

1. $ goog $ spy $ qqq $ ma $ tlt
2. optionstraining video : payoff diagrams URL $ goog $ googl $ tsls $ tqqq $ xlv $ xnrg $ nke $ dia URL
3. rt ewj japan ishares exchange URL $ ewj $ ewh $ goog $ hjoe ewj investing nasdaq URL
4. rt evening scans : $ dal $ dg $ goog $ googl $ aapl $ gm $ f $ slv $ dust URL URL URL
5. our penny stock alerts gained over 3400 % for subscribers in 7 months ! see our new picks : URL $ ibm $ goog $ aapl

It looks like the target stock is ""goog"" from tweet 1, since it's repeated in all tweets and appears to be related to Google (GOOG). The other tweets mention options or stocks like SPY, QQQ, MA, TLT, etc., which are different ETFs but might represent various assets. Tweets 2 and 3 talk about option strategies and payoff diagrams, which could relate to trading strategies but don't directly mention the stock.

Now, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors:

1. ""quick - update from option millionaires - stock options chatroom i've wrote many times ... URL"" – Positive (update, option writing) but no negative points.
2. ""optionstraining video : payoff diagrams URL $ goog $ googl $ tsls $ tqqq $ xlv $ xnrg $ nke $ dia URL"" – No positive or negative mentioned directly related to Google.
3. ""rt ewj japan ishares exchange URL $ ewj $ ewh $ goog $ hjoe ewj investing nasdaq URL"" – Positive (JPN, investing) and a bit of negative (equity).
4. ""rt evening scans : $ dal $ dg $ goog $ googl $ aapl $ gm $ f $ slv $ dust URL URL URL"" – Positive factors like APEX, GM, F, SLV.
5. ""our penny stock alerts gained over 3400 % for subscribers in 7 months ! see our new picks : URL $ ibm $ goog $ aapl"" – Positive (alerting subscribers) and mentions IBM and Apple.

Assessing sentiment from each tweet: Tweets 1 and 5 are positive, with some minor negatives. Tweets 2, 3, and 4 don't mention sentiment as they are more about options and payoff diagrams without explicit quotes or sentiments towards the stock.

Combining these factors, the overall sentiment is positive because tweet 5 strongly supports trading strategies and gains for subscribers, which can encourage buying the stock. Even though tweet 1 has a minor negative (option writing), it's not enough to outweigh the other positives."
2015-06-05,Missing,File not found
2015-06-06,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided four tweets related to Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock in each tweet. The most common stock mentioned is ""goog"", so I'm focusing on that. Now, for each tweet, I have to separate positive and negative factors.

Looking at tweet 1: It's promoting a YouTube video about stock options basics. Positive because it seems helpful and beneficial to investors.

Tweet 2 mentions Google's financial performance but doesn't specify an expected outcome, so it's neutral since we don't know if they're optimistic or pessimistic on their performance as of the time of the tweet.

Tweet 3 is encouraging others to learn about stock options. Positive again because offering educational content can attract investors seeking information.

Tweet 4 talks about a strategy and potential profits. Positive sentiment here as it indicates a plan is in place, which is generally good for investors.

Tweet 5 mentions a specific selling signal. This could be seen as negative if the seller thinks it's beneficial or if there's a sell offer, but since it's just stating a position without context, I might consider it neutral because it's more about strategy than predicting stock performance.

Tweets 6 and 7 discuss financials and investing opportunities. Positive sentiment for both since they're highlighting areas where investors could see gains.

Summarizing each tweet: Positive, Neutral, Positive, Negative, Neutral, Positive, Positive. Combining these seems to overall show a mix of positive and slightly negative sentiments. However, the negative tweet is just one out of seven, so it might be overshadowed by the others being more varied but mostly supportive."
2015-06-07,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how the given tweets are impacting the stock price of a company. The user has provided 10 tweets and needs my analysis.

First, let me identify the target stock from the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER true balls . $ aapl $ goog $ intc $ mtw $ cat $ x $ c $ csco $ t $ se $ wu $ mu $ wba URL URL"". It seems like the company is referred to as AT_USER because it includes both their name and ""true balls."" So, I'll focus on AT_USER.

Now, looking at each tweet one by one:

1. The first tweet mentions several stocks like Adepto, Apple, Google, etc., but there's no direct mention of AT_USER. It talks about the company being a ""true balls"" so maybe it's a startup or a younger firm. Since there's no specific information linking this to AT_USER, I might have to assume it's unrelated.

2. The second tweet mentions BOS SOCIAL taking on Google and Facebook. Again, not directly related to AT_USER.

3. Third tweet says the penny stock is up 166% from just 5 days ago. This suggests a significant increase in price. A 166% gain could indicate positive news, so I'll mark this as positive.

4. Fourth tweet talks about Google and GGL (which is G Gluon). No mention of AT_USER here either.

5. Fifth tweet mentionsgoog, SSO, PMCB, etc., again not related to AT_USER.

6. Sixth tweet introduces HQY, short sales, and mentions shares for H & R Block. Doesn't seem relevant to AT_USER.

7. Seventh tweet is a promotional video on options basics, mentioning G+, APEL, AMZN, FB, etc. Not directly about AT_USER or goog.

8. Eighth tweet has multiple companies listed, including DG, GOOG, APL, GM, F, SLV, DUS. Again, nothing to do with AT_USER or goog.

9. Ninth and tenth tweets are repeated mentions ofgoog being featured on market parse for iPhone. This is a standard SEO tactic, but doesn't provide specific information about the stock in question.

Putting it all together, except the first tweet which might be unrelated, there aren't any direct links to AT_USER's stock. The only significant tweet showing price increases is number three with a 166% jump, indicating a positive trend.

So, despite some tweets mentioning other companies or trends related to goog and its competitors, none are directly influencing AT_USER's stock. Therefore, the overall sentiment would be neutral because while there's some positive news about price movement, it's not from the company in question."
2015-06-08,Positive,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the overall impact on the stock price based on these tweets about Google. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. That's straightforward—just looking for something like ""goog"" or ""xlu"". So:

1. The first tweet mentions a chart of the day for Google.
2. The second tweet talks about $ goog having a sentiment of 2 and being featured on MarketParse.
3. The third tweet lists several sectors, including spdr (SPDR), xlu, fxc, etc., all related to utilities.
4. The fourth tweet mentions selling a signal at $533.33 on June 5th using Yamasuta's free algorithmic trading software for Google stock.
5. The fifth tweet talks about MSFT and other stocks being up or down by various amounts.
6. The sixth tweet starts with ""abriendo"" which means welcoming, opening a large number of $ goog dollars at 526.7 USD to 527.129, mentioning trading indicators like PT and SL.
7. The seventh tweet mentions closing the exchange where Google was and noting gains or losses.
8. The eighth tweet states that Google is class C dividend.
9. The ninth tweet says Google shares have risen by 0.23%.
10. The tenth tweet suggests NEX (which I believe is NASDAQ) for Google.
11. The eleventh tweet mentions Apple and Google highlighting a growing gap between them.
12. The twelfth tweet involves FB's fidelity stock.

Now, analyzing each factor:

1. The first tweet is about the chart, which doesn't directly impact sentiment but sets context.
2. The second tweet talks about sentiment being positive with a score of 2, and it's featured on MarketParse, which often reflects market trends.
3. The third tweet lists various sectors including utilities, which can affect investor sentiment as utilities are a concern in the tech sector.
4. The fourth tweet is a sell signal using a trading system for Google. This could indicate investor confidence or expectation of losing value, which might be negative for their stock price.
5. The fifth tweet discusses multiple stocks with up and down movements; without specific details on direction, it's hard to say, but the mention of MSFT could imply positive news about tech stocks in general.
6. The sixth tweet is welcoming and mentions opening a large volume at a slight increase, which might be seen as positive by some investors looking for trading opportunities.
7. The seventh tweet talks about closing an exchange with gains or losses; it doesn't specify the direction but suggests Google is doing well.
8. The eighth tweet states that Google is a class C dividend, which is good news for stock price.
9. The ninth tweet says shares have increased by 0.23%, indicating positive news about the company's performance.
10. The tenth tweet refers to NASDAQ, which is a major market index, but without details on what's happening there, it's ambiguous.
11. The eleventh tweet mentions Apple and Google highlighting a growing gap between them, which could mean that investors are watching how Apple might perform relative to Google, possibly affecting Google's stock price negatively if they expect Apple to outperform or vice versa.
12. The twelfth tweet involves FB's fidelity stock, but without details on the status or trading activity, it's unclear.

Combining all these factors:

- Sentiment points towards a positive market (as seen in the second and sixth tweets).
- Utilities sector being featured might lead to some negative sentiment due to its concern for tech companies.
- The fourth tweet suggests selling signals, which could indicate fear or uncertainty about the stock, contributing to negative sentiment.
- A slight increase in NASDAQ (tenth tweet) is positive but not significant enough on its own.
- Apple-Google gap (eleventh tweet) adds uncertainty and potential for negative news.

However, some factors like utilities, Apple-Google trade, and class C dividend are more direct, while others might be less clear. Overall, the positive sentiment from features in market parse and trading activities seems stronger than the other points.

But considering that all tweets contribute to a context of uncertainty or growth, especially with the Apple-Google gap which is significant, it's harder to say for sure if the overall sentiment is positive or negative. However, since most factors point towards positive events (utilities being featured, NASDAQ, class C dividend) and some indicate potential issues (selling signals), it leans more positive."
2015-06-09,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me start by identifying the target stock from each tweet. 

Looking at the first tweet: ""ziop ziopharm oncology , inc . bid URL $ ziop $ goog $ blta $ db ziop share finance."" Hmm, the stock symbol isn't clear here. Maybe it's related to biotrac or some other company? Not sure yet.

Next, "" $ goog : us google car collisions minor google inc URL sp500"" mentions Google and mentions car collisions, which could be a warning about market corrections due to safety concerns. That might affect investor sentiment negatively.

Then ""rt AT_USER why everyone suddenly thinks google will acquire twitter $ goog $ twtr URL."" This seems like a positive tweet encouraging investors to buy Google, possibly increasing demand for the stock. So that's a good sign.

Next tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ goog trimmed 252 puts at $ 5.16 from $ 2.30 / / / $ spy $ tsla $ aapl $ nflx $ fb"" talks about stock price changes, which would affect the price directly.

Another tweet mentions Tim Cook and Steve Ballmer, trying to determine if he's the new Steve Ballmer. That could be a reference to him possibly stepping down or changing roles, affecting investor sentiment based on media coverage.

Then "" $ aapl $ goog eta 2015-85 - nasdaq to introduce a new patent pending retail order process : news cat ... URL AT_USER."" This seems like another positive tweet about Google's future plans, potentially driving stock prices up.

The next tweet talks about trade strategies for the next company. If it's related to a product line expansion or market expansion, that could be positive for the stock.

Next: "" $ goog URL more bad news for obamacare : enrollees see little benefit from medicaid expansion."" This is a warning against healthcare costs, which would likely cause investors to sell their Google shares, leading to negative sentiment.

Then ""act actavis , inc . dividend"" suggests that the company might buy back shares or pay dividends. Dividends are a sign of positive financial performance and often increase stock prices. So this could be a boost.

The tweet about closing with the best jobs for women in 2015 is probably unrelated, so it doesn't impact the stock directly.

Lastly: "" $ baba nice closing . but not to break 88 $ $ spy $ qqq $ aapl $ googl $ goog $ twtr $ fb $ baba $ pcln $ tsla $ bidu $ amzn $ msft URL"" mentions BABA, which is a stocks company. If they're doing well or underperforming, that could affect the stock.

Putting it all together: The tweets include both positive and negative sentiments. Some are encouraging investors to buy Google, while others concern market safety issues and company performance. However, some tweets might have more weight if they come from more prominent figures like Tim Cook or BABA's recent news."
2015-06-10,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company based on the given information. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at each tweet individually might help me assess their individual factors and sentiment. Then, combining those will give me an overall picture.

Starting with the first tweet: ""vdsi vasco data security intl , inc . ask size URL $ vdsi $ goog $ tvix $ sgoc vdsi stock finance."" It seems like it's asking about the VSDI stock and mentioning competitors. Since there's no explicit positive or negative word, I'm not sure what sentiment this tweet has.

Second tweet: ""verizon : competition only likely to intensify URL $ cmcsa $ tmus $ dish $ goog $ s $ googl $ vz."" This one mentions Competition is likely to intensify and the company goes public. It seems like a positive sign because it's predicting an increase in competition, which could affect pricing.

Third tweet: ""goog digital report for jun 10th , 2015 $ goog URL."" It's about a Google Digital Report happening on June 10th, 2015. That sounds like an official news event, so that might be positive or neutral depending on the context.

Fourth tweet: ""AT_USER your tweet about $ goog had a sentiment of 4 and was featured on market parse . URL."" This one is a bit unclear. It mentions AT_USER's tweet scored sentiment 4 and was featured on the market parse. Sentiment scores typically range from -5 to +5, so 4 could mean very positive or just neutral. The mention of being featured suggests it's highly relevant.

Fifth tweet: ""$ goog $ spy $ qqq $ ma wednesday morning reads – 6/10 / 15 - update from option millionaires - stock options chatroom w ... URL."" This is a general statement about the Google stock and mentions other stocks. It doesn't specify sentiment, so it's hard to tell if this is positive or negative.

Sixth tweet: ""our stock pick on $ ppch has gained over 122 % in the past 2 weeks ! major news : URL $ amzn $ mcox $ goog."" This one talks about a major news related to Amazon and Meta, both of which are well-known tech companies. The stock picked up significantly, so this is likely positive.

Seventh tweet: ""$ cerrado 1 largo de $ goog a 537.77 usd ganando 9.97 usd idop 249868 vía AT_USER URL."" It mentions that the exchange rate of VSDI (which might be SPAC or Vasily offchain, but not sure) is increasing by 9.97 USD and there's a news update from somewhere. This could affect stock prices due to exchange rate fluctuations, which can impact trading, so it's probably neutral.

Now, let me analyze each tweet:

1. VSDI stock with competitors asked about size.
2. Competition expected to increase for VERizon.
3. Google Digital Report on June 10th, 2015.
4. AT_USER's tweet with a high sentiment score.
5. General stock update from other companies.
6. Significant gain in company stock over two weeks.
7. Exchange rate news affecting VSDI.

Positive factors seem to include VERizon's expected competition increase and the significant growth of ppch, which is good for their stock price. Negative factors are less obvious except maybe the Google Digital Report, but that's more about an event rather than sentiment. AT_USER's tweet isn't explicitly negative or positive, just scored 4.

Overall, there's a strong positive push from VERizon and the growth in ppch. The other tweets aren't enough to counterbalance these positives, so I think the overall impact is Positive."
2015-06-11,Positive,"Okay, I'm trying to analyze these tweets to figure out their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

Starting with tweet 1: It says our stock alert gained over 1300% in less than three months and lists some new picks. That's definitely positive, so that's an indication of strong momentum.

 Tweet 2 mentions cvs cvs health corp, but it's not clear what information it provides. I don't have enough details to assess its impact on the stock price.

Tweet 3 talks about tanh tantech holdings ltd and their investments in tech companies like Google and SPAC. This could be a positive indicator of technology sectors which often move up or down, so that might contribute positively.

Tweet 4 is about some profits and mentions multiple tech companies: ADP, A laps,goog, SpaceX, Internet, MSFT, O cado, DUC. These are all tech companies, so it's likely affecting the overall tech sector performance, which could be positive.

Tweet 5 is about tracking and curating tweets for multiple tickers, including Apple, Google, Microsoft, Twitter. This suggests broader market engagement or stock research, which might influence investor sentiment positively if these stocks are doing well.

 Tweet 6 reassesses Google's position regarding a target. If it's a reassessment moving towards the short-term target, that could indicate confidence in future growth, hence positive.

Tweet 7 mentions Apple studying Google. This could be an investment opportunity, possibly leading to increased demand for both companies, which would be positive.

Tweet 8 talks about CNNMoney focusing on making cities better by improving services like sidewalks. If this is relevant to the company's offerings or strategy, it might boost investor interest, contributing positively.

Tweet 9 mentions a stock pick with high growth and major news, which suggests strong momentum in the tech sector after some events, contributing positively.

Tweet 10 refers to AT_USER on Google's tweet being featured by Apple. This is more personal or user-related content and doesn't provide direct information about market performance.

Now, combining all these, tweets 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 each point towards positive trends in tech companies and broader stock engagement, which are strong indicators for a positive stock price. The only neutral tweet is number 2 because it's vague. So overall sentiment should be positive."
2015-06-12,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a given company. Let's see, each tweet is about a different stock or company, so I'll have to extract each symbol and then assess each one.

Starting with the first tweet: ""AT_USER $ goog france ups privacy pressure on google URL."" This seems positive because it mentions increased privacy pressure, which could be a signal for investors. I'll mark this as Positive.

Next, the second tweet is ""goog google inc . - class c company info URL $ goog $ ko $ acwv $ myec goog pennystocks finance."" The word ""class c"" often refers to high-quality internet capitalization companies, which can be a sign of confidence. So that's also Positive.

Third tweet: ""rt AT_USER google new tool to help potential customers choose their android phones URL $ goog $ googl URL."" A new tool for Android users seems beneficial and could boost sales, which is good news. I'll mark this as Positive too.

Fourth tweet: "" $ goog $ spy $ qqq $ ma friday morning reads – 6/12 / 15 - update from option millionaires - stock options chatroom afte ... URL."" The mention of ""stock options chatroom"" and ""option millionaires"" might be about investor sentiment, but I'm not sure how this directly affects the company's financial health. It could be Neutral.

Fifth tweet: ""vrx valeant pharmaceuticals intl , inc . news URL $ vrx $ panw $ nke $ goog vrx share stocks."" Verve is a well-known pharmaceutical company, and their stock might be priced above their actual performance. Negative sentiment here would make sense because if they're undervalued.

Sixth tweet: ""breaking : $ bbry blackberry considering android on some of its devices . URL ( sure brings them closer to $ goog if true )"" Blackberry's Android device consideration could affect their stock price positively, as it might improve the company's product offerings. Positive.

Seventh tweet: ""rt AT_USER save 75 % by finding the cheapest broker to trade us tech giants URL $ aapl $ goog $ msft $ fb $ twtr sprea …"" A big reduction in trading costs could lower expenses and increase profitability, which is positive. Positive again.

Eighth tweet: ""rt $ tsla algos triggered sell in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 09:08 , p / t 242.00 $ goog $ twtr $ bidu $ gpro $ nflx …"" TSLA is a tech company, and their stock price being influenced by other companies could be a microcosm effect. Not sure about the overall impact here; maybe Neutral.

Ninth tweet: ""$ goog $ aapl $ twtr tweet this ! - update from option millionaires - stock options chatroom $ twtr has come full circl …"" A new tweet on Google's social media with an emoji could prompt more activity, which might be positive. I'll go with Positive here.

Now, let me count the positives and negatives: 1. Positive, 2. Positive, 3. Positive, 4. Neutral, 5. Negative, 6. Positive, 7. Positive, 8. Neutral, 9. Positive. So that's mostly Positive except for negative #5. The overall sentiment is leaning towards Positive because there are some neutral points but most tweets are either positive or just neutral."
2015-06-13,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze the given tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of the company mentioned. The tweet is ""seven who returned their apple watch : URL $ aapl $ goog $ pcln $ k"". Let me break this down.

First, I recognize that Apple's stock symbol is AP. The words ""apple watch"" stand out to me because they refer directly to Apple. The other symbols ($aapl, $goog, $pcln) might be placeholders or typos in the tweet, especially since 'pcln' doesn't make much sense on a stock price unless it's part of a URL or something else. 

The user seems satisfied with their apple watch purchase, which could indicate positive emotions towards Apple. The mention of ""URL $"" and ""k"" might just be part of the tweet structure, not significant in terms of sentiment.

Considering each relevant tweet: I'll separate into Positive and Negative factors. Here, the main point is that the user bought something they liked (their apple watch), which could boost their overall satisfaction with Apple. 

Assessing the sentiment, the user's positive response suggests a favorable outlook on Apple's stock. The other symbols might be distractors or incorrect data, so I don't need to focus on them for sentiment.

Combining these factors: The tweet expresses approval and positivity towards Apple products, which is good for their stock price. There are no negative elements mentioned that would drag the sentiment down.

So, putting it all together, this tweet reflects a positive outlook on the company, especially given the direct reference to Apple's product. I'm leaning towards a positive overall sentiment."
2015-06-14,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem step by step. So, I have these tweets about different stocks, and I need to determine their impact on the stock price based on the given options: Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

First, I'll start by identifying each tweet to extract the target stock symbol. That should help me focus on the relevant information in each one. Looking at the tweets:

1. 5 cheap and easy ways to improve your website SEO URL $ goog $ msft
2. cmge china mobile games and entertainment group ltd . filings URL $ cmge $ blue $ _spy $ goog cmge share investing
3. our stock alerts gained over 1300 % in less than 3 months ! see our new picks : URL $ amzn $ mcox $ goog
4. $ ppch is one of the fastest moving penny stocks this month , so far ! special update : URL $ dpm $ frak $ goog
5. avgo avago technologies ltd . shares URL $ avgo $ ief $ goog $ hill avgo stocks invest
6. $ goog - are facebook's moves in artificial intelligence less scary than google's ? URL
7. $ goog URL as scotus decision looms , obamacare satisfaction reaches 86 percent URL
8. our stock pick on $ ppch has gained over 122 % in the past 2 weeks ! major news : URL $ cbl $ goog $ bll

From these, it looks like multiple tweets are focusing on ""goog"" and ""ppch"". So, I can focus on those two stocks for analysis.

Now, for each tweet related to ""goog"", I need to assess factors. Let's take the first tweet: It mentions SEO URL gains 5 ways, so maybe positive. But then it brings up $ msft, which ismsft? Or was it msft or mstaf? Wait, in the first tweet, there are two $ goog URLs and msft. Maybe that's a typo? Let me check.

Wait, looking back: ""5 cheap and easy ways to improve your website SEO URL $ goog $ msft"". Oh, maybe it's a typo where they meant $ mstaf or something else. But since the main focus seems to be on goog and ppch, I might skip this tweet as it's unclear.

Next tweet is about cmge, which is cmge China Mobile Games and Entertainment Group Ltd. The tweet mentions filings and a share URL, but the key point is $ cmge $ blue $ _spy $ goog cmge share investing. So, that seems like it's related to google's stock. I'll note this as one positive factor.

Then, the third tweet talks about ""our stock alerts gained over 1300% in less than 3 months"". That's a strong number, so that's definitely positive. It also includes new picks with URLs, which might indicate positive information about the company.

Fourth tweet: $ ppch has been one of the fastest-moving penny stocks this month, gaining over 122%. That sounds good because it's a growing trend in tech companies; more growth means investors are hopeful, so that's positive.

Fifth tweet mentions avgo and ief shares from avago, which is also a tech company. The mention of investing with these stocks suggests they're doing well, which would be positive for goog.

Sixth tweet asks if Facebook's AI moves are less scary than Google's. That's more speculative but could affect investor sentiment. If it's viewed as neutral or negative because other factors might influence it, but since it's just a statement without strong information, maybe it's considered neutral or even slightly negative in context.

Seventh tweet talks about the upcoming U.S. Supreme Court decision on SCOTUS and how satisfaction with OBAMA has reached 86%. That's an opinion piece, which can be seen as positive because it shows market attention and sentiment, so that could be positive for goog.

Eighth tweet mentions a stock pick on ppch gaining over 122% in the past two weeks. That's very strong growth, which is a clear positive indicator for investors.

Now, I need to evaluate each tweet:

1. cmge: Focused on $ cmge and $ goog, but not clearly a factor.
2. $ cmge (the first part): Positive.
3. stock alerts gained: Strong number.
4. ppch growth: Very strong.
5. avgo shares: Mentioned, so positive.
6. Facebook vs Google: Speculative, could be neutral or slightly negative.
7. SCOTUS decision: Positive opinion, which might influence investors positively.
8. Stock gain: Definitely positive.

Now, combining these, most of them are positive factors related to goog except for the sixth tweet about Facebook and OBAMA satisfaction, which is a bit more uncertain but overall sentiment could be neutral because it's speculative. The rest have strong positives. However, each tweet contributes some information or opinion that should add up positively.

So overall, even with one minor uncertainty from the sixth tweet, the majority are positive, so I would conclude as positive."
2015-06-15,Neutral,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on the future stock price of a company. Let's go through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet says that at t gigapower fiber internet is launching in Charlotte and ahead of AT_USER URL $ goog. Hmm, not sure what AT_USER refers to here—maybe an username? Also, it mentions the stock symbol Google $ goog, which makes me think they're looking for a stock related to Google.

2. The second tweet says RT AT_USER why Google is investing in over-50s: URL goog url. Not entirely clear on what's being invested into, but it sounds like Google is focusing on older users. That might affect their user base or retention strategies.

3. The third tweet mentions that $ ppch is a fast-moving penny stock this month, so far! Special update: ibm goog aapl slp. It seems like they're highlighting some tech stocks moving quickly. Maybe it's about how these stocks are performing and could impact the overall market?

4. The fourth tweet says NMS should be on radar screen—more and more are noticing this one: 10 is in sight. NYSE goog url. This suggests that investors are tracking a specific stock, which might indicate a strong positive trend.

5. The fifth tweet talks about Sony's new venture Xperia Z4/Z5 going to rock the market soon: sne gao aapl snlf goog bbry msft. This is about a specific company, so it could drive up their stock price but maybe not too much.

6. The sixth tweet mentions platinum subscribers saw penny stocks gain over 150% in two weeks! Big update: cbl goog bll. A significant increase in penny stocks could be a good sign for the market, especially if they're seen as undervalued or high-quality.

7. The seventh tweet refers to Google's momentum on a certain day with specific stocks like spy, ibb, twtr, intc, tlt. It seems like it's talking about how Google is moving forward and perhaps indicating that they're confident in their future performance.

8. The eighth tweet is about UWTI VelocityShares 3x long crude ETF last price: uwti amba goog kre uwti finance invest. This looks like an ETF related to crude oil, which might affect the stock market through energy prices. Could be a minor factor but could have some impact.

9. The ninth tweet mentions that Xperience WhatsApp's market cap is close to full price: socl goog msft apsc. It seems like it's about a company (Xperience) and its relationship with WhatsApp, which is a technology company. Maybe this could influence the overall tech sector.

10. The tenth tweet talks about XBI Energy Resources Inc. being a financials stock: xbi iwm goog swir xbi stockmarket nasdaq. This is another financial stock to watch, possibly affecting broader market trends in energy or finance.

Putting it all together, these tweets seem to be talking about specific companies and their investments or movements that could affect their respective stock prices. Some are from tech firms like Google, others from financials or ETFs. There's a lot of mention of penny stocks, which can sometimes indicate undervaluation or good growth potential. Companies are focusing on new ventures, products, or expanding into specific industries.

But looking at each tweet as individual signals, they seem to be showing different aspects: investments in younger users, market momentum trends, energy prices, etc. It's a mix of positive and negative signs. However, if the overall trend is still favorable for these companies, it might lead to a positive impact on their stock price.

But I'm not sure about the overall sentiment because each tweet can have different tones. Some are looking good, others more uncertain. If most of them are showing growth or positive indicators, then perhaps overall it's positive. But given that some could be negative signs as well, I might lean towards a neutral stance."
2015-06-16,Neutral,"Alright, let's analyze these tweets to figure out their impact on the stock price of the company in question.

First, I need to identify each tweet and extract the relevant information. Starting with tweet 1: It mentions goog selling large shares to a US dollar, which is a negative factor because it could affect the value. That's at least a Neutral or Negative thought.

Tweet 2 talks about the T-mobile and dish network deal not happening and gives two reasons. While this isn't explicitly bad news for goog, the mention of a deal might imply some potential conflict, but without specific reasons presented as bad or positive, it's hard to say. I'll consider this as Neutral because it doesn't present clear bad or positive information.

Tweet 3 discusses AT_USER saying that google's project selling phones in India is failing due to low costs. That sounds like a problem for google's operations and could negatively impact the stock price. So, this adds another Negative thought.

Next, tweet 4 mentions a $ goog project discussing technology related to 3D scanning the world and its implications for independent stock trading sites. While it's speculative but suggests some ongoing activity, without specific negative or positive aspects, it's probably just neutral in terms of sentiment.

Tweet 5 talks about benzinga's buyout odds being at the top right now. That seems like a positive outlook because it implies potential gains. This adds a Positive thought to the overall analysis.

Tweets 6 and 7 don't present any specific negative or positive info, so they can be considered Neutral or perhaps neutral since there's no clear message on their impact on goog.

Tweet 8 is about russell 2000 exchange rates but that doesn't seem directly related to goog. It might have some indirect effects, but without specifics, it's hard to assess as a significant factor here.

Putting this all together: There are two Negative tweets (tweets 1 and 3), one Positive tweet (tweet 5), and neutral or minimal info from others. The overall sentiment seems to be Neutral because while there are both bad and good factors, they're not strongly enough to push the stock price in either direction.

Wait, but I just realized that in the initial analysis, I counted two Negative tweets, one Positive, and considered some as Neutral. But let me recount: tweets 1,3,5 – that's three tweets. Two are Negative (tweets 1 and 3), one is Positive (tweet 5). So overall, it leans more towards a mix of both, but not overwhelmingly negative or positive. However, tweet 5 does present a positive outlook which might have some weight.

So maybe the sentiment is leaning Positive because there's a potential for gains from benzinga's buyout, even if others are mixed. But without clear majority, it's tricky. Since the question asks to conclude with one of [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative], I think considering tweet 5 as a positive point in favor might make the overall sentiment Positive.

But wait, actually, when evaluating multiple tweets, each has its own impact. While tweet 5 is positive, there are other negative tweets that could outweigh it. However, maybe the fact that benzinga is buying stakes for $ goog doesn't directly affect google's stock price unless there's speculation or expectation of increase in value.

Alternatively, perhaps the lack of a clear message from others dilutes the impact, making the overall sentiment neutral because there are no dominant factors driving the price. But given tweet 5 does present a positive outlook, it might push the stock up, but other negative tweets mean it's not as strong as if all were positive.

I think I'll go with [Neutral] because while tweet 5 is positive in a way, there are other tweets that add negativity, so the overall impact isn't overwhelmingly one direction."
2015-06-17,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on Google's stock price. So, the user provided five tweets and asked for an analysis using the given criteria: identify the stock symbol, analyze each tweet as positive or negative factors, assess sentiment, and then summarize everything.

First, I need to extract the stock symbols from the tweets. Let's go through them one by one:

1. The first tweet mentions $ goog - keysight technologies buying Anite for GBP 388 million. The word "" goog"" is repeated here, so that must be Google. So, the stock symbol is GOOGL.

2. The second tweet has ""gs goldman sachs group,"" which I think stands for GM (General Motors), but maybe it's just GM for simplicity since GM is a major US company. So, the stock symbol would be GM. But wait, GM isn't Google; that might complicate things because the user wants to analyze future stock price of Google. Hmm, maybe this tweet refers to GM instead? Or perhaps ""gs"" and ""goog"" were just placeholders for something else. I'm not sure yet. Maybe it's a typo or referring to a different company.

3. The third tweet says ""uber poaches a $ goog engineering VP who had a significant role in building Google Maps."" So, again, "" goog"" is Google, so the symbol is UBER.

4. The fourth tweet is about ""blackberry will this be the quarter of hardware rebirth?"" The word ""黑灵"" translates to blackberry in Chinese, which I think refers to BlackBerry. So, the stock symbol here would be BLACKBERR (assuming it's a typo for blackberry). But wait, I'm not sure if ""will this be"" implies a change or rebirth, but that might affect competitors rather than Google.

5. The fifth tweet mentions $ nke, $ bx, $ dis, $ fsphx, and $ goog $ twtr ... entry related to dead money: $ goog $ twtr ... all a matter of entry. It seems to be discussing entry points or trading ideas on the stock market, so this could affect investor sentiment positively by attracting new buyers.

Now that I have the symbols identified as GOOGL, GM (GM), UBER, BLACKBERR, and TWTR. But since the goal is to analyze Google's stock price impact, only GOOGL will matter for determining the overall effect.

Looking at each tweet:

1. Keysight Technologies buying Anite might be a positive sign if it brings in more revenue or technology that could benefit Google. But I'm not sure about the financial impact on Google itself.

2. GM vs GM is a bit confusing, but maybe this is referring to GM as a company with significant market influence, possibly unrelated to Google's stock.

3. UBER poaching an engineer for Google Maps might affect their reputation and revenue streams, potentially impacting GM or other competitors, which could have implications on the market for the tech sector overall, including Google.

4. BlackBerry being referred to here probably isn't directly related unless it relates to Google's hardware products. If blackberry is mentioned in a context that affects Google's revenue or product line, that could be considered as well.

5. The tweet talks about entry points and dead money, which might attract new investors, boosting the stock price positively.

Putting this together: the tweets mention potential acquisition of other tech companies (GM, UBER, Blackberry), poaching someone for a company (Google Maps), and attracting entry into the market through dead money. These factors could indicate positive sentiment towards Google or its competitors, which might indirectly affect the company's stock price. However, I'm not sure if these activities are directly related to Google itself.

Given that GM is a major US company with significant impact on global tech and finance, its mention might have both positive (as it's in GM) and negative factors (if GM is a competitor). Similarly, UBER poaching someone could affect the market but isn't directly Google. Blackberry being mentioned might not relate directly to Google's products unless it's about hardware or software that Google offers.

Overall, these tweets seem to involve activities that could increase investor confidence by attracting new buyers and possibly reducing competition, which in turn can boost stock prices. Therefore, despite some uncertainty about GM, the positive aspects suggest a possible positive impact on the stock price of Google."
2015-06-18,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to determine the impact on the stock price based on these tweets. The user wants a clear conclusion between Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""AT_USER $ goog is part of the mg25 index . interested in your opinion . URL"". So the stock is GOOG or Google.

Next, for each tweet, I have to identify positive and negative factors. Let's go through them one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions that $ goog is part of the mg25 index. That seems like a positive factor because it affects investor sentiment about the company.
2. The second tweet has multiple stocks mentioned: $ gpro, $ inflx, etc. All these companies are tech-related and possibly undervalued or in beta, which could be negative if they're not performing well. There's also mention of live in neverland, but that seems irrelevant here.
3. Third tweet talks about the search engine on Twitter. It suggests it might have more relevance, beating Google for some reason. This is a bit vague, but maybe indicating some relationship with Google stock.
4. Fourth tweet focuses on $ qqq (QQQ) and mentions hft algorithms breaking a certain price level. Breaking price levels can be seen as a signal of potential buying pressure if the market moves up after it breaks, which might have positive implications for the stock. Also, mentioning multiple financial institutions could imply interest in investing there.
5. The fifth tweet is about something unrelated to Google. It refers to SSMFL (I think that's some sort of cryptocurrency), so no direct impact on GOOG.
6. The sixth tweet compares Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc., asking which can revolutionize mobile news. This could be positive if one company has more growth potential in that space, but it's speculative without specifics on how it affects GOOG directly.
7. The seventh tweet mentions social media for Apple or Google and whether they should buy Twitter. This seems like a competitive strategy to enter the social media market, which is often seen as an expansion, potentially positive.

Now, considering each factor:

Positive factors: The mg25 index (1), hft algorithms breaking price levels (4), social media expansion (7). Negative factors: Multiple tech stocks mentioned in 2 and 6, live in neverland (but unclear if relevant), SSMFL (no real impact on GOOG).

The overall sentiment seems to be mixed. There are positive indicators like the index and hft algorithms, but there's also skepticism from other companies. However, the social media entry is speculative but could provide opportunities.

Given that some factors are positive and others are negative, it might not lead to a clear overall trend. It could be neutral because while there are positive developments, there are signs of uncertainty and risk. Therefore, the sentiment seems neutral."
2015-06-19,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of the given company. Let me start by identifying the target stock symbol from each tweet.

1. The first tweet mentions AT_USER and $ goog, but it's not clear if AT_USER is the stock name. Since other tweets mention $ goog specifically, I'll assume the target stock is Google (GOOGL).

2. Each tweet talks about Google-related topics, so focusing on GOOGL seems appropriate.

Looking at each tweet:

1. ""AT_USER got some insightful tips about $ goog on mg URL."" No clear info on GOOGL here.
2. ""cnbc must have this bearish mkmpartners $ twtr analyst back on when it retakes 200 - day AT_USER / / $ socl $ goog $ msft AT_USER"" – Not sure about GOOGL in this context.
3. ""ca dmv gets pressured into releasing autonomous car accident reports . looks similar to what $ goog told us . URL"" – Again, no mention of GOOGL.
4. ""shak saleen automotive , inc . 52wk low URL $ shak $ brss $ c $ goog shak stocks investing"" – Not related to GOOGL.
5. ""rt AT_USER 10:48 am : twitter / google acquisition rumors start . last time i had to wait until 12:29 pm . not bad … $ goog $ twtr"" – This is a bearish note about Google's acquisition rumors, which could be positive or negative depending on context. The user is speculating about Google, so this might indicate some uncertainty.
6. ""rt AT_USER twitter $ twtr moving higher due to renewed speculation google $ goog may make a bid for the company ."" – This talks about stock price movement, possibly indicating investor sentiment towards GOOGL.
7. ""righ rightsmile , inc . ideas URL $ righ $ ko $ psx $ goog righ pennystocks share"" – No mention of GOOGL.
8. ""$ goog : investors sell shares of google on strength following insider ... : URL"" – Investors selling shares could indicate bearish sentiment, which is bad for stock price.
9. ""2 ways facebook could expand its dominance URL $ goog google $ twtr $ googl $ fb"" – Not related to GOOGL.
10. ""rt AT_USER about $ goog & nasa fuel — ( 1 ) URL and ( 2 ) URL google nasa - via AT_USER"" – No mention of GOOGL here either.
11. ""access curated tweets - high relevancy , less spam - us tech giants URL $ aapl $ goog $ msft $ fb $ t … URL"" – Again, not related to GOOGL.
12. ""our stock pick on $ ppch has gained 192.27 % in the past month ! huge update : URL $ cbl $ goog $ bll""

Now, compiling the information:

- There are no tweets mentioning GOOGL, except for the second tweet, which includes MKMPARTRES, but that's irrelevant.
- The third tweet talks about autonomous cars and Google, but it doesn't directly impact stock price.
- The fourth tweet is unrelated to GOOGL.
- The fifth tweet mentions acquisition rumors but focuses on Twitter, not Google. It's possible the user is speculating about Google, which could be both positive (if they're worried about rumors) or negative (if they're seeing uncertainty).
- The sixth and seventh tweets are speculative about stock movements, which could indicate investor sentiment towards GOOGL.
- The eighth tweet says investors are selling shares following insider transactions; that's bearish news.
- The ninth is irrelevant.
- The tenth doesn't mention GOOGL.
- The eleventh is unrelated.

Considering all these, the fifth tweet suggests uncertainty about Google's acquisition rumors. This could mean some investor sentiment is on edge but might be a mixed signal. However, since investors are speculating, it's possible the overall sentiment remains neutral or slightly bearish because the uncertainty might not lead to significant movements."
2015-06-20,Negative,"Okay, I need to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on a stock's future price. The user has given me 7 tweets, each with their own content. Let me take them one by one.

Starting with the first tweet: ""ssri silver standard resources , inc . prev close URL $ ssri $ abc $ aapl $ goog ssri nasdaq share."" Hmm, I don't recognize this company or its stock symbol. It seems like it's listing the stock symbols of different companies in a confusing way. Maybe it's not relevant to our target stock.

Next tweet: ""dal delta air lines inc . last price URL $ dal $ goog $ hack $ agio dal share stock."" Again, I don't recognize the company or its symbol. It seems like just general information without any stock reference. Probably doesn't impact the overall sentiment towards the stock we're focusing on.

Third tweet: ""google is more like christopher columbus before he found the new world URL $ goog google $ googl."" This one mentions Google, which is a well-known tech company. The context seems like someone is comparing Google to someone else, perhaps a historical figure. It's unclear how this directly affects a stock price. Maybe it's unrelated or just an observation.

Fourth tweet: ""scanning the sa family for alpha : daskapital 1000 URL $ amzn $ fb $ goog $ jnj $ ko $ nflx $ pg $ t $ tsla $ xom."" This looks like a news article about a stock named TSLA, which is Tesla. The mention of ""alpha"" might be related to performance or financial metrics. However, without specific details on the stock's current price or trends, it's hard to assess sentiment.

Fifth tweet: ""$ tsla news : "" scanning the sa family for alpha : daskapital 1000 $ amzn $ fb $ goog … "" URL analyze : URL."" This seems like a structured news article about TSLA. The context mentions something about performance metrics, which could affect investor sentiment if it leads to positive or negative news.

Sixth tweet: ""rt AT_USER could twitter be worth $ 100 billion to google ? analysts weigh in $ goog $ twtr URL via AT_USER."" This is a comparison between Twitter and Google. The mention of $100 billion for Twitter suggests a potential investment angle, but again, not directly related to the stock we're evaluating.

Seventh tweet: ""rt sammantic : your future banks are $ aapl , $ goog , $ fb & alibaba's online bank is now valued at more than $ 45 billi … URL."" Similar to previous ones, this seems like content about Google and other tech companies. It doesn't mention any stock or its symbol.

After going through all seven tweets, none of them are directly referencing the stock whose future price we're predicting. They seem to be discussing various unrelated topics and company news. Therefore, it's unlikely that these tweets will have a significant impact on the stock's price."
2015-06-21,Negative,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price of some companies. Let me start by breaking down each tweet one by one.

First tweet mentions fxi ishares and talks about a fund related to the ftse china 25 index. It seems like it's providing information without much analysis, so maybe neutral.

Second tweet is about a new site where investors pick stocks based on an article. Since they're just introducing something without any positive or negative info, I'm leaning towards neutral here too.

Third tweet criticizes Apple with the ""taylor swift criticizes apple"" line. Negative comments can definitely influence investor sentiment, so this could be a strong negative point.

Fourth tweet talks about ntes shares and their trading ideas. While there's some talk of the company but not any positive or negative keywords, I'm not sure if that's enough to make it neutral. Maybe slightly negative?

Fifth tweet is about brk and boreal water collection. It mentions p/e ratio and investing finance. A p/e ratio is a metric, so perhaps that could signal some concern, which might be negative.

Now, combining all these thoughts: three negative tweets and two that are somewhat positive or neutral. The overall sentiment seems to lean towards negative because there's enough information pointing towards negative comments."
2015-06-22,Neutral,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative for the stock price of pennystocks. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at tweet 1: ""rt penny_stocks 1 : $ goog google inc URL pennystocks pennystock $ qden $ bstk $ vgtl $ dirv $ di … URL."" Hmm, this seems like a link or maybe some content from pennystocks. The links are to Google Finance URLs, which usually show stock prices and other info. I don't immediately see any positive or negative words here—just URLs for financial data.

Next is tweet 2: "" unh unitedhealth group , inc . eod data URL $ unh $ goog $ adp $ fnma unh share pennystocks."" This one has ""unitedhealth,"" which I know is a real company but not well-known. It mentions Google and FLMMA as stock symbols, possibly related to that company. The presence of ""unitedhealth"" might make some investors unsure about their investment decisions because it's an unfamiliar name. So maybe there's some uncertainty here.

Now tweet 3: "" feye fireeye inc . ex-div date URL $ feye $ goog $ mu $ rig feye finance stockmarket."" Again, this is linked to Google Finance. It mentions ""ex-div"" which indicates a potential dividend payment, but it's not clear if that affects the stock price positively or negatively. The mention of ""finance"" could be a distractor or maybe related to another company.

Putting it all together: tweet 1 seems neutral because it doesn't provide any direct information on stock performance. Tweets 2 and 3 are about other companies but don't directly relate to pennystocks. So overall, there's no clear positive or negative impact on the stock of pennystocks from these tweets."
2015-06-23,Missing,File not found
2015-06-24,Positive,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of Google. Let me start by understanding what each tweet is saying and then breaking it down.

First, the user provided three tweets:

1. ""rt AT_USER twitter buyout odds are at the greatest right now $ fb $ goog $ twtr URL""
2. ""$ goog google inc . ( goog ) discloses sec form 4 insider selling : sergey brin sells ... : google inc . ( goog ) dis ... URL""
3. ""rt $ nflx hft algos triggered buy in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 09:46 , p / t 720.00 $ goog $ twtr $ bidu $ gpro $ fb $ tsla $ aapl $ qqq quant""

I'm not entirely sure about all the abbreviations and terms, but I can try to parse them step by step.

Starting with the first tweet: ""AT_USER twitter buyout odds are at the greatest right now $ fb $ goog $ twtr URL"" – At first glance, it seems like a buyout announcement is being discussed. But AT_USER might be an abbreviation for someone or something else. Maybe they are from Twitter? The mention of Google's stock prices could imply that some investor sentiment is positive about buying bigger companies. So this tweet is likely positive.

Second tweet: ""$ goog google inc . ( goog ) discloses sec form 4 insider selling : sergey brin sells ... : google inc . ( goog ) dis ... URL"" – This looks like a news item where Google is recalling stock due to an inside sale (SEC Form 4). If there's an insider selling, that usually indicates investor sentiment could go up. However, the exact mention of a recall might have negative implications if it affects investors' confidence in the company's financials. But since it's about an action by an individual, maybe not so much on the stock price but more on investor reactions.

Third tweet: ""rt $ nflx hft algos triggered buy in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 09:46 , p / t 720.00 $ goog $ twtr $ bidu $ gpro $ fb $ tsla $ aapl $ qqq quant"" – This seems like Google is triggering buys on several stocks listed with different abbreviations. It could be that the tweet is signaling increased buying activity, possibly due to insider trading or other financial movements. Such buy orders might indicate investor sentiment is positive as more money is being put into the company.

Now, putting it all together:

- The first tweet points towards a positive outlook for Google.
- The second tweet involves an insider transaction, which could be seen as a positive signal to investors.
- The third tweet also suggests increased buying activity, reinforcing a positive sentiment.

Even though there's mention of some negative elements like a recall or possible insider selling, the broader context seems to indicate that Google is doing well and people are optimistic about the stock. So overall, considering these factors, the impact on the stock price would likely be positive."
2015-06-25,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how the given tweets are going to impact the stock price of a company based on their analysis. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I need to extract the target stock from each tweet. Looking at them:

1. ""abriendo 200 largos de $ goog a 539.27 usd con un pt en 542 y con un sl en 538.5 idop 261862 vía AT_USER URL"" – The stock symbol here is IDOP.

2. ""$ goog ' s autonomous pod cars are roaming the streets !"" – So, GOOG.

3. ""our new penny stock pick on $ gyst closed up 26.32 % yesterday ! big news : URL $ cbl $ goog $ bll."" – This seems to be referring to CBL and BLL stocks. I'm not sure if these are related to GOOG, but maybe they're other companies.

4. ""$ csco cisco systems , inc . market cap"" – CSCO.

5. ""$ gyst closed up yesterday ! watch it closely this week . special update : URL $ erbb $ bbda $ goog."" – GYZ.

6. ""AT_USER $ goog set to surge: 'all aboard !' wallstreet investment investing trading."" – GOOG again, I think.

7. ""$ google inc . - class c % change URL $ goog $ sh $ gdxj $ hnu.to goog stocks finance."" – GOOG and SH.

8. ""$ ye of little faith ' what has it cost you ? part 1"" – Not sure about this one; maybe a typo or unrelated stock, but I'll note it as NOPE.

Now, the user wants to determine the overall sentiment based on these tweets. The analysis should summarize how each tweet affects the stock's sentiment.

Starting with IDOP:

- ""abriendo 200 largos de $ goog a 539.27 usd..."" – This is a new order book and might indicate a slight increase, but it's not a major update.

Next, GOOG:

- The tweet mentions autonomous cars on streets, which could be positive for the company or industry. It also says the stock closed up, which is a strong positive indicator.

Then, CBL and BLL:

- They mention a penny stock pick closing up. Penny stocks are attractive to investors because they trade at a deep discount. If it's increasing in value, that would be positive for GOOG. However, I'm not certain if this is related or just another unrelated stock.

ERBB and BBDA:

- GYZ again refers to Google, which suggests there might be multiple mentions of GOOG on different platforms, but the tweet itself talks about a special update. Maybe it's an unrelated news segment that could have some positive effect.

GOOG and SH in one tweet: This seems confusing, maybe another unrelated company or typo. Not sure what this implies for GOOG.

The user also has a note saying ""use one of the following tags exactly: [Positive], [Neutral], [Negative]"".

I need to figure out if all these tweets collectively indicate that GOOG is going up in price. The first tweet mentions 200 largos, which could mean the stock is getting more participants or better terms, but I'm not certain. GOOG closing up again adds some positive energy.

ERBB and BBDA could be separate topics, so it's hard to tell if they add to GOOG's sentiment. CBL and BLL might be unrelated but could have a slight positive effect due to the penny stock trade.

Putting this together: GOOG is mentioned multiple times, including closing up in one tweet and being involved in a car-related topic which could be good for investors. The other tweets don't seem to indicate negative or neutral sentiment about GOOG's performance. Therefore, it seems like GOOG might have an overall positive impact on its stock price."
2015-06-26,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company by analyzing each tweet one by one. Let me start by understanding what's required.

First, from the user's problem statement, they want me to look at each tweet, determine if it contributes positively, negatively, or neutrally towards the stock's future price, and then give an overall summary as either [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. They provided a set of 6 tweets with some symbols involved.

I think I should break down each tweet step by step. 

1. **First Tweet:** ""xlv health care select sector spdr eod data URL $ xlv $ v $ goog $ dwti xlv share nasdaq"" Hmm, this seems like a list of stock symbols or investments, but it doesn't specify a particular stock. I'm not sure how to interpret that yet. Maybe the user intended to mention a specific stock symbol? But as it stands, this tweet might be too ambiguous for me to assess.

2. **Second Tweet:** ""adpt adeptus health , inc . ask size URL $ adpt $ goog $ eem $ uup adpt stock tradeideas"" This one has several words like ""ask,"" ""size,"" and specific stocks (adpt, eem, uup). It mentions a company called adpt. I'm not sure about the context or whether this relates to a particular stock. Without more info on what 'adpt' stands for, it's hard to evaluate its impact.

3. **Third Tweet:** ""$ mjmj is quickly becoming one of the fastest moving marijuana stocks ! big news : URL $ dpm $ frak $ goog"" This seems like it could be referring to a stock named ""mjmj."" It mentions marijuana stocks and uses ""big news"" which suggests that something significant has happened. I'm not sure what 'dpm' or 'frak' stand for, but if it's about stock performance, this might be positive.

4. **Fourth Tweet:** ""our stock pick on $ ppch is up 415 % for our subscribers , since our original release at . 02 ! huge news : URL $ cbl $ goog $ bll"" This one mentions a stock called 'ppch' and talks about an increase in value from 415%. It also references another stock (cbl, bll) and mentions the original release date. Positive info here, likely contributing to investor confidence.

5. **Fifth Tweet:** ""our penny stock newsletter alerts gained 200 % in 2 weeks ! get our next pick early : URL $ cbl $ goog $ bll"" Similar structure as tweet 4, just with a different stock (cbl and bll again). Positive info about increased value.

6. **Sixth Tweet:** ""fcx freeport-mcmoran , inc . market cap URL $ fcx $ t $ xhb $ goog fcx trade ideas invest"" This mentions the market capitalization of a company called ""fcx."" It's unclear which specific stock this refers to, but if it's about performance or growth, it could be positive.

Now, I'm trying to determine each tweet's impact. Since tweet 1 is too vague and tweet 2 has limited context, perhaps they can't influence the stock price effectively. Tweets 3 and 4 are more specific, mentioning marijuana stocks and a significant increase in a stock, which might be seen as positive. Tweets 5 repeats some of that information but emphasizes growth.

I'm leaning towards positive because tweets 4 and 5 mention increased values and stock picks. The third tweet is ambiguous but mentions ""mjmj,"" which if it's a known stock could be positive. But without knowing 'mjmj,' I can't say for sure, so maybe I should treat it neutrally.

But considering the other tweets that are more specific with significant news about stocks and higher values, especially in tweet 4, perhaps the overall sentiment is positive."
2015-06-27,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on a company's stock price. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually and see what information they provide.

The first tweet says ""a must read document , click URL thanks , AT_USER $ goog $ fb $ ibm $ lyb … URL"". Hmm, it looks like a link from an individual named AT_USER to some URL. The keywords here are GOOG, FB, and IBLM. These could be indicators of interest in these companies or maybe pointers to something specific about the user's activity.

The second tweet mentions "" insider selling : google major shareholder sells $ 18304601 . 12 in stock ( goog ) URL $ goog"". This seems like they're stating that Google has an insider who is selling a significant number of shares. The exact amount isn't specified, but it's clear that there's mention of an insider selling.

Now, to assess the overall sentiment impact on the stock price. Let's consider each factor:

Positive factors: The link from AT_USER might imply they're interested in these companies, which could mean more positive sentiment or interest in future earnings or stock performance. However, it doesn't directly state whether the stock is going up or down.

Negative factors: The insider selling directly impacts investor sentiment. Selling shares typically reduces demand for the stock, which can lead to a negative sentiment towards the stock price. This could cause investors to sell their stocks, possibly leading to lower prices.

Putting these together, while there's a positive note from the link suggesting interest in Google and Facebook, the insider selling is a strong negative factor that directly affects investor confidence. The combination of both suggests a potential shift downward in stock price."
2015-06-28,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on a company's stock price. The user has given me three tweets and wants me to analyze each one step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbols in each tweet: AT_USER mentions avav, mcd, and Apple (AAPL). Let me check if those are real companies or just some placeholder names. Since they're not actual company identifiers, I can't really look up their stock prices yet. But maybe the sentiment will influence how positive or negative I consider them as.

For each tweet:

1. The first tweet is about avav and trades on NASDAQ. It says ""rt AT_USER avav aerovironment inc . eod data URL $ avav $ goog $ goog $ ko avav tradeideas nasdaq"". It looks like it's promoting the company, mentioning financial info and stock connections with Google (GOOG) and Apple. High volume might mean positive sentiment since they're trading a lot on NASDAQ.

2. The second tweet mentions mcd and trades on the US market, linking to google stocks. It says ""mcd mcdonalds corp . ask size URL $ mcd $ goog $ aryc $ cree mcd stocks trade ideas"". The mention of Google again suggests positive impact because investors might be looking at how mcd's stock relates to Google.

3. The third tweet is about Apple, listing their tweets and mentions other US tech giants like Apple (AAPL), Amazon, etc., linked to Google. It says ""rt AT_USER access curated tweets - high relevancy , less spam - us tech giants URL $ aapl $ goog $ msft $ fb $ twtr"". This seems to emphasize the importance of Google in US tech companies, which could drive stock prices as investors might see increased interest from major tech firms.

Putting it together: all three tweets are promoting or linking companies with Google and Google stocks. They're trading on major exchanges like NASDAQ for avav, NASDAQ for mcd, and NASDAQ/AAPL for apple. High volume in these contexts usually indicates that there's a significant amount of interest or positive perception from investors.

Therefore, considering all three tweets, the sentiment is overall positive because each promotes the company through connections with Google, which can positively influence investor sentiment."
2015-06-29,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at tweet 1: It says $suti up another 66.67%, mentioning blog alerts from our penny stock and URLs for MSFT, APPL, and GOOGL. That's positive because it's an increase in shares or something like that. So that's a good sign.

Now, tweet 2 is about CITigroup. It mentions investing trends on Tquad with topics including stock forums, trading ideas, etc. While some of this could be negative if the market is down, others might be positive for investors looking to trade. But since it doesn't specify, I have to consider it as mixed.

Tweet 3 talks about Google's investor opinions and their stock prices. If Google is up and they're giving opinions, that could lead to positive sentiment as investors might buy more shares.

Tweet 4 mentions Gopro Inc., asking for size information on CSIQ and SGPY. This seems like a user query or technical info, not directly related to stock price movements.

Tweet 5 discusses AMC's approach to robots versus humans. It says ""wrong approach may be just what real humans need."" If the tweet is critical of how companies handle technology, it could suggest that the stock might be affected negatively because investors would react by selling their shares or reducing positions if the company isn't handling tech as they should.

Tweet 6 talks about EBAY's nasdaq positions and their growth. It mentions long, short, and neutral positions from the NASDAQ. That could lead to mixed sentiment depending on how many are positive and negative. If there are a lot of long positions (buying) and some negatives, it might be a mix.

Tweet 7 says Market thinks Greece should go. That's interesting because Greece is in the Eurozone, which affects European markets. If this tweet is from an American perspective, maybe it's not directly related to US stocks but could influence global market sentiment indirectly.

Tweet 8 talks about CBL and BLL stock picks going up by 370%. That's a huge increase, so that's definitely positive for the company.

 Tweet 9 mentions our stock pick on PPHC up 370% since its original release. This could mean that the stock is performing well in the market, which would be good news and thus positive sentiment.

Putting it all together: Tweets 1, 3, 8, 9 are all positive because of share increases or new information about the company. Tweet 5 gives a critical opinion on how companies handle tech, suggesting potential negative reactions from investors who might sell their shares if they're not adapting properly to technology trends.

So, some tweets are positive for the stock price (tweets 1,3,8,9), and one tweet is slightly negative (tweet 5). However, since most of the main tweets point towards good news, especially with a lot of increases in shares or investments, it leans more positive overall."
2015-06-30,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I need to extract the stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at tweet 1: ""URL supertrades could buy a freakin house with this recent win ! ! $ mbly $ aapl $ jcp $ tasr $ goog"". It mentions APPL (Appumetion Protein Life Sciences) and GOOG, which is Google, so I think the company is likely Apple Inc. or maybe Google. But looking at the rest of the tweets, I see they mention Excel, Tesla, AT&T, and Google again.

Next, tweet 2: ""xlk technology select sector spdr company info URL $ xlk $ goog $ uvxy $ rxmd xlk investing nasdaq"". Here, it mentions TSLA (SpaceX) and GOOG. So the company could be either Excel or Tesla, but given that other tweets mention APPL and GOOG, maybe it's a mix of companies.

Tweet 3: ""rt AT_USER the ultradistancia project - one artist's vivid distortions of google earth images ... URL $ goog googleear …"". This seems to relate to Google Earth. I'm not sure about this tweet; it might be more about tech or geolocation. So, maybe this tweet is less impactful on the stock price compared to the others.

Now, analyzing each tweet:

1. The first tweet mentions that URL (URL stands for Universal Robot) could buy a freakin house with a recent win. This seems promotional and positive, especially since it includes Google Earth images, which might appeal to investors looking for tech or real estate-related deals. So this is definitely positive.

2. The second tweet talks about the Technology Select Sector of SPDR (S&P 500) and mentions Excel and Tesla. These are well-known companies in the tech sector with a lot of market presence. They typically have strong financials, so any mention here can be seen as positive for the stock price.

3. The third tweet is more vague about Google Earth images and an artist's project. It doesn't provide specific information on the company, but it might be a bit unrelated to tech or finance. I'm not sure if this would have a significant impact on the stock price, especially given that other tweets are positive.

Considering all three tweets: two are clearly positive due to their promotional language and mention of well-known companies, while the third is less specific and could be seen as neutral or maybe slightly negative in context. However, I think it's more likely to be a bit of an outlier. Combining these thoughts, especially since the first tweet directly ties to Google Earth, which is a significant tech image, this would boost investor confidence.

So, overall sentiment should be positive."
2015-07-01,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company based on the provided information.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at tweet 1, it mentions Greece's hopes, financials jumping, and sector-specific stocks like AT_USER stocks higher amid Greece's expectations and data. That seems to indicate that the target stock might be Apple (AAPL), as it's mentioned in multiple tweets.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one to assess their impact on the stock. 

Tweet 1 talks about Greece's hopes for stocks, financials jumping 1%, which is positive. It mentions several sector-specific stocks. This seems encouraging for investors.

Tweet 2 has a line ""Fuel ? $ pbr $ goog — (1) URL"" and another with ""(2) URL"". I don't have context on what these lines are referring to, but the mention of Google's stock price suggests that the overall sentiment might be positive as Google is mentioned in multiple tweets.

Tweet 3 mentions Google Inc., class C market cap, and discusses investing. This shows interest in tech stocks, which Apple would likely support.

Tweet 4 talks about trading ideas for five stocks related to SEO. While this could indicate potential opportunities or strategies, the focus on a few specific areas might not be enough for a broad stock analysis.

Tweet 5 introduces trading ideas focusing on 5 stocks for tomorrow. Again, similar to tweet 4, it's more of a detailed strategy than a general stock assessment.

Tweet 6 discusses bioprotech stocks and their size. This could indicate growth potential, but without specifics about Apple or Google, I'm not sure.

Tweet 7 brings in a blog on trade ideas and ideas from Google. It seems like this is providing information that might be useful for the company, which is Apple.

Tweet 8 mentions proshares ultra short positions in S&P 500 and other stocks. Proshares is known to provide conservative investment strategies, but it doesn't directly mention Apple or Google.

Putting this all together, each tweet seems to focus on providing information about tech stocks like Apple or Google, which are major companies with significant market capitalization and influence in the financial sector. The positive mentions of Greece's hopes for earnings and the overall interest in tech sectors make me lean towards a positive impact on the stock price."
2015-07-02,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of the company. Let's take it step by step.

First, looking at each tweet individually. 

1. The first tweet mentions that $sutis gained 66.67% since a penny stock blog alert and includes links to various stock names like $dpm, $frak, and $goog. This seems positive because the stock price is increasing. It's talking about news related to the company.

2. The second tweet states that this service made 20,000% gains in the last month and offers subscriptions on a website linked with several stocks: $ibm, $ goog, $aapl. Again, this sounds positive as it mentions gains and stock information. It's not making negative comments.

3. The third tweet talks about an executive buying a certain amount of stock for $goog at $522.12 starting on July 2, 2015, at 14:40 UTC and is linked to a URL like id266741. This seems neutral because it's providing information without making any positive or negative claims about the company.

4. The fourth tweet says that if someone predicted $twtr and $goog would close positively today on their local time zone, they were right. It's offering advice on stock performance. While there are positive comments, the language is more promotional rather than providing factual information, so it might be considered neutral because it doesn't directly state a positive or negative outcome.

5. The fifth tweet mentions that our penny stock newsletter alerts gained 200% in two weeks and offers our next pick for $amzn and $mcox at a price point of $goog. Again, this is positive news about the company's performance.

Now, combining all these factors: The first four tweets are either positive with some information or just predictions without specific statements. The fifth tweet reinforces the positive sentiment by mentioning growth. 

Looking at each factor:
- Positive tweets (1, 2, 5): All point towards increasing stock prices.
- Negative tweets (3, 4): They provide information but don't have direct positive or negative impact on the stock.

The overall sentiment seems to be a combination of positive statements and neutral information. There's no strong negative word used, so it leans more positive than neutral. The fourth tweet has some enthusiasm and suggestions without definitive information, which might lean towards a slight positive effect but not overwhelmingly so."
2015-07-03,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to determine whether each tweet impacts the stock price positively, neutrally, or negatively for the given company. The user provided six tweets and some sample stock symbols like jnj, spdr, fv, goog, etc. My task is to analyze each one step by step.

Starting with the first tweet: ""jnj spdr barclays high yield bond etf message board posts URL $ jnj $ slb $ fv $ goog jnj stockmarket investing."" This seems like it's promoting a ETF related to high-yield bonds, specifically invested by jnj stockmarket. High-yield bonds are generally seen as safer investments, which might reduce market volatility. If investors feel more secure, they might buy more, which could increase the stock price. So, this looks positive.

Moving on to the second tweet: ""htz hertz global holdings , inc . short sales URL $ htz $ cpg.to $ hod.to $ goog htz stockmarket invest."" This mentions short sales by HFR, a long-term concern for many investors. Short selling can lead to losses if it's not done properly, especially with short-term expectations of rising prices. But since it's about short sales and the company itself, it might affect investor sentiment negatively. However, I'm not entirely sure yet.

The third tweet: ""i wish you guys an ... $ mdin $ slnn $ cote $ fb $ gbsn $ aryc $ aapl $ twtr $ spy $ goog $ mjmj $ mdcn $ auri $ baba $ f $ gm $ nflx URL."" It's a message suggesting an ETF, but the specifics are unclear. The mention of Adepto and NFLX could indicate tech stocks, which can go either way depending on their performance. This one is a bit ambiguous without more info.

The fourth tweet: ""content recommendation challenges traditional display ads market ; post available at URL $ yhoo $ goog outbrain finrofca."" Here, it's talking about content recommendations affecting the display ad market and suggesting posts for YHOO and GOOG. If people are looking for better content ideas, it might attract viewers, which could drive sales. However, I'm not certain if this is positive or negative.

The fifth tweet: ""rt fintechna : rt twhooker : seize the day ! 4thofjuly fintech $ qqq $ aapl $ goog URL URL."" This is from Twitter where rtf fintech and tweeker are active. Seizing the day might mean quick gains, but without more context about their impact on the stock, it's hard to tell if this is positive or negative.

The sixth tweet: ""google open-sources its software for making trippy images with deep learning deeplearning $ goog URL."" This seems like a tech-related update, possibly enhancing their AI services. Enhancing products can boost demand and user base, which would be positive for the stock price.

Finally, the seventh tweet: ""google's founders tried to sell to excite for under $ 1 million in 1999 , but excite turned them down . google is now worth $371 billion. $ goog."" This talks about an event where the founders rejected a deal under specific conditions and then sold their company, which was valued at $371 billion. It seems like a loss for the company, so this would likely be negative.

Putting it all together:
1. Positive because promoting safe investments.
2. Neutral or uncertain due to short sales and HFR's long-term concerns.
3. Ambiguous but possibly positive if Adepto is a tech股.
4. Neutral as content might attract users but without more info on what that does for the stock.
5. Unclear, but could be negative if fintech is bad news or positive otherwise.
6. Positive because enhancing AI software can drive demand.
7. Negative due to the founders' decision affecting the company's value.

So overall, combining all these, it seems there are mixed signals. But leaning more towards some being positive and others negative."
2015-07-04,Neutral,"Alright, so I'm looking at these tweets and trying to figure out their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First tweet is ""rt AT_USER five minute trades - $ aapl $ fb $ googl $ goog $ gpro $ ibb $ lnkd $ qqq $ spy $ twtr $ v $ tsla $ nflx $ baba $ amzn - URL"". Hmm, this seems like a list of stock symbols for different companies. It's not clear what this tweet is about, just listing them out. I'm not sure if each company listed has any relevant information or trends they're talking about.

Second tweet says: ""rt AT_USER cash holdings ( $ billions ): apple $ aapl - $ 194b microsoft $ msft - $ 108b google $ goog - $ 67b national debt of greece - …"". This one mentions Apple's cash holdings at around $194 billion, Microsoft at $108 billion, Google at $67 billion. It also talks about Greece's national debt. If the company is holding a lot of cash and has high net worth companies, that could indicate financial stability or growth, which might be positive for the stock price.

Third tweet: ""algn align technology , inc . tick URL $ algn $ goog $ bib $ bidu algn stocks investing"". I'm not sure what this tweet is suggesting. It mentions a company by the user named algn, possibly an alignment of tech companies like Google, Baidu, and Alphabet (Alphabet). The phrase ""stocks investing"" suggests that this is a topic they're discussing, maybe about trends or upcoming investments in tech stocks.

Putting it all together, none of these tweets directly mention specific stock symbols. The second tweet provides cash holdings for Apple, Microsoft, and Google, which are significant companies. If the company being analyzed has high net worth in these sectors and mentions financial stability or growth, that could be a positive sign. However, without knowing more about how these holdings are impacting the company's overall strategy or future prospects, it's hard to say definitively.

I'm leaning towards the second tweet suggesting some positive trends because holding large amounts of cash and having significant tech companies listed can indicate financial health. But since none of the tweets specify a particular stock, I might not have enough context to make an accurate prediction. It could be that the overall sentiment is neutral because while there are positive factors like high net worth, the information provided isn't specific to any individual stock.

Alternatively, maybe the user is making broad observations about tech stocks as investments, which might influence investor sentiment but don't directly impact a single company's stock price in a clear way. So, without more context on how this information will affect specific companies or trends, I think it's safer to assume a neutral overall sentiment."
2015-07-05,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the overall impact on Amazon's stock price based on these tweets. Let me start by going through each tweet one by one.

The first tweet mentions a penny stock newsletter alert that gained 200% in two weeks and offers a next pick. That seems like positive news because it's showing significant gains. The user is pushing for an early pick, which probably means they're excited about investing.

Looking at the second tweet, it talks about cash holdings in AT&T ($A) worth $194 billion, Microsoft ($MSFT) at $108 billion, Google ($G) at $67 billion, Greece's national debt is $342 billion. So these are financial figures, which can influence investor sentiment positively because they're talking about wealth and assets.

The third tweet highlights $SUTI gaining 66.67% since the penny stock blog alert. This is a news item related to SUTI, which might indicate economic or market news affecting the stock. The user is focusing on this and updating, so it seems like positive information is being shared.

Finally, the fourth tweet mentions $SUTI having seen 400% gains in the past two weeks with special updates. This reinforces the positive trend they're discussing. It's all about SUTI's performance, which could be a leading indicator of the stock's health.

Putting this together, each tweet is providing information that suggests good news for Amazon. The user seems to be encouraging the market by emphasizing cash gains and future picks. The financial details add credibility, but they're more supportive rather than negative. So overall, there's a mix, but it leans towards positive sentiment because of the optimistic outlook on SUTI."
2015-07-06,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on stock prices. First, I need to identify each tweet and extract the target stock symbol. 

Looking at the first tweet: $ goog URL the 5 types of organizational structures : part 1 , the hierarchy URL. Hmm, that seems a bit off because URLs typically start with http:// or https:// but here it's just $ goog. Also, the mention of "" organizational structures"" and ""hierarchy"" doesn't seem related to stock symbols.

Moving on to the second tweet: $ btu peabody energy corp URL … This one looks like it might be a typo because PEABODY isn't an index or stock symbol, so I can probably ignore this one.

The third tweet is about call buyers betting on an acquisition and mentions GOOG. That seems related, so Google's symbol would be goog.

Looking at the fourth tweet: bbry $ goog $ aapl $ csco seems like the slider will be a bb10 hypervisor google play services as the keyboard opens its all bb10 = $ millions "" ! The key here is 'goog' and 'aapl', which are Google and Apple's stock symbols. But wait, there are other mentions of BBRY and CSCO, but I don't have their symbols. This might be confusing.

The fifth tweet: our penny stock newsletter alerts gained 200 % in the past 2 weeks ! special update : URL $ ibm $ goog $ aapl. Again, 'goog' is present with a lot of mentions, so this could be Google's performance.

The sixth tweet: pennys stock newsletter alerts gained 200 % in the past 2 weeks ! get our next pick early : URL $ erbb $ bbda $ goog. Here, both 'goog' and 'erbb' (though I don't recognize it as a stock symbol) are present, so Google's performance is again highlighted.

The seventh tweet: cerrado 3 cortos de $ goog a 522.35 usd ganando 0.48 usd idop 268531 vía AT_USER. This seems like an exchange rate update related to Google, which could affect their US dollar value or net worth.

The eighth tweet: company shares of google inc . drops by -1.56 % URL $ goog. Here, 'goog' is explicitly mentioned with a percentage change, indicating a negative impact on Google's stock price.

So the key stocks involved are GOOGL (google), AAPL (apple), BBRY (not sure about this one, but could be mispelled), CSCO, and IBM (issued by ibm). But without knowing the exact symbols of BBRY and CSCO, I can't fully analyze them. However, since 'goog' is in multiple tweets with some positive updates and a negative one, it's likely Google is the primary player here.

Looking at each tweet: some mention GOOG's performance, others talk about Apple (a different company), and others are about exchange rates or other unrelated topics. The combination of mixed signals—some positive for Google, some negative—makes it hard to determine a clear overall sentiment. However, since there are multiple tweets pointing in both directions, the stock might be in a volatile position."
2015-07-07,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative for the given stock, which is probably Apple Inc. Let's break down each tweet one by one.

Starting with the first tweet: ""$ goog $ googl news : "" stock splits , reverse splits , and stock dividends $ ua $ nflx … "" URL analyze: URL. Hmm, this seems a bit confusing. It mentions something about stock splits and dividends but doesn't provide specific information about Apple. The phrase ""stock splits , reverse splits"" is pretty generic. I don't see any indication of positive news related to Apple or their stock performance.

Moving on to the second tweet: ""URL searchcap : russia right to be forgotten , bing ads , google adwords & bing pong $ goog URL"". This one looks like it's about some ads and search results. There are mentions of bing, Google, Bing, and Russia, but again, nothing directly related to Apple or their stock performance. The context seems too broad and doesn't provide any specific information on how this affects the stock.

The third tweet is a repeat: ""URL searchcap : russia right to be forgotten , bing ads , google adwords & bing pong $ goog URL"". Similar to the second one, it's about ads and Google-related terms but again, no mention of Apple. It seems like all these tweets are discussing general topics that don't directly relate to the stock performance or anything specific to Apple.

Finally, the fourth tweet: ""our stock pick on $ ppch is up 370 % for our subscribers , since our original release at . 02 ! huge news : URL $ ibm $ goog $ aap"". This one mentions that their stock has gone up by 370% since its release. That's a significant increase, but it doesn't provide any information about Apple itself. It might be referring to another company or unrelated products.

Putting this all together, none of the tweets provide specific information about Apple Inc.'s stock performance. They're either discussing broader topics or irrelevant content. Therefore, I don't have enough data to assess whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative regarding the stock price."
2015-07-08,Missing,File not found
2015-07-09,Neutral,"Alright, let's break down how I approached determining the impact on the stock price based on the provided tweets.

First, I identified the target stock symbol from each tweet. The first tweet mentions ""goog"", which is a common abbreviation for Google Inc., so I focused on that company. The other tweets talk about Facebook and AI companies, but since there are no explicit links or symbols, it seems they don't refer to specific stocks.

Next, I looked at the factors mentioned in each tweet. In the first tweet, the user likes Google's posts and mentions Twitter's servers, which doesn't directly relate to a stock. The second tweet is more about buying something already, which could indicate enthusiasm but might not be very negative. The third tweet discusses Google's AI plans without specific stocks.

I then analyzed each tweet for positive or negative factors. The first tweet seems neutral because it just mentions the user and doesn't provide any specific reasons to believe in a stock's performance. The second tweet talks about buying something, which is a sign of excitement but again not strong enough to outweigh other opinions. The third tweet mentions AI initiatives without providing details on how that affects a particular stock.

Assessing sentiment for each tweet: The first and third tweets are positive in terms of user engagement but don't provide actionable information. The second tweet is more about enthusiasm, which can be considered slightly negative as it increases investor interest without specific reasons to buy or sell.

Putting it all together, while there's some positive engagement with users, the other factors mention things like AI initiatives and server design that are more speculative. These are unlikely to have a significant impact on any particular stock. Therefore, combining these thoughts, I concluded the overall sentiment was neutral."
2015-07-10,Negative,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. The user provided some tweets and instructions on how to analyze them. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol. Hmm, none of the tweets mention a specific company, so maybe it's not necessary for this analysis? Or perhaps I'm missing something?

Now, looking at each tweet one by one. 

1. The first tweet says ""google now worth $700, credit suisse's stephen ju says..."" Wait, that doesn't seem relevant to the stock symbol. It's talking about Google's value and a person's opinion on another company. Maybe it's irrelevant for the target stock I'm trying to analyze.

2. The second tweet is ""AT_USER what are your thoughts on $ goog . thanks for all the information you provide."" This seems like it's from an AT_USER, so they're asking the user about Google's current value and thanking them for providing info. It might not directly impact a specific stock unless I'm missing the target.

3. The third tweet is ""rt AT_USER search queries to google on mobile devices now outrank desktop + laptop in the us $ goog $ aapl URL URL."" This seems like it's comparing search volume on mobile vs desktop and laptops. It could indicate user behavior, maybe related to stock performance based on how people use Google.

4. The fourth tweet is ""wiseguys always play $ goog , rarely the $ googl."" This looks like it's discussing the frequency of people talking about Google compared to another company. It might not have a direct impact unless there's implied correlation, but I'm not sure if that's relevant.

5. The fifth tweet is ""russ direxion daily russia bear 3x shares prev close URL $ russ $ ibb $ goog $ unp russ stocks nasdaq."" This seems to be about theRussell 2000 stock, mentioning a price drop and related companies in the US. It might indicate a shift in market sentiment towards Russell, which could affect investor sentiment for any stock on that index.

So far, only the fifth tweet mentions a company, which is Russell Directories (RUS) in theRussell 2000 index. This seems like a specific sector or segment of the broader market. The tweet says the stock dropped by 3x and was trading lower before the index closed. 

Looking at sentiment indicators:
- The price drop from 50 to 16 suggests investor worry.
- The mention of ""prev close"" and ""next expected"" could indicate anticipation or uncertainty about future performance.

Putting this together, a significant price drop in a sector like Russell Directories might lead investors to reassess their positions across the entire market. If Russell is doing well, it could positively affect stocks in that index, but if the market is uncertain, it might be negative.

I'm leaning towards mixed sentiment here because the impact depends on the broader market conditions. However, considering the direct mention of a significant price drop and potential shift in investor confidence, I think the overall sentiment is Negative."
2015-07-11,Positive,"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on a given company's stock price and determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative.

First, looking at tweet 1: It mentions trading ideas, which is about discussing stock investments. That suggests that investors are likely interested in buying more shares, so this could be positive.

Tanget 2: TSLA (Tessla Technologies) is a tech company. The quote suggests they're seeing increases in their stock prices, which indicates investor confidence, making this a positive tweet.

Tweet 3 talks about platinum subscribers having increased gains by 4000% over 10 months and mentions subscribing today. This sounds like a promotional offer to encourage users to buy more shares, so it's definitely positive.

Tweet 4 discussesgarmin navigating from cars to the wrist, which is about health tech, specifically wearable devices. Garmin has been making strides in fitness tracking, but it hasn't gone public yet, so while there are opportunities, investors might still be cautious. This could create some uncertainty, leading to a slight negative sentiment.

Tweet 5 mentions Google investing $100 million and seeing membership growth in less than two weeks. This is positive news for the company, as it shows strong demand and potential for increased revenue.

Tweet 6 talks about Google investing in a security company and links to other companies (goo, gog). It's unclear what specific investment they're making, but if it's a significant move, it could impact the stock price positively or negatively based on the type of investment. Since it's speculative without more info, it might be considered neutral.

Finally, tweet 7 mentions Android integration into Google's services through googl and ssnlf. This sounds like a positive promotional action for mobile devices, which could attract new customers and increase sales, contributing to stock growth.

Putting all these together: tweets 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are all positive in terms of discussing investment opportunities or promotions. However, tweet 4 is about a company that hasn't made news yet, so it's less clear-cut but still has some potential. The overall sentiment seems to be leaning towards positive because the tweets are all encouraging investor interest and promoting product launches or investments.

So, considering all these factors, I'll conclude with [Positive]."
2015-07-12,Neutral,"Okay, I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price for a company. The user provided five tweets and wants me to summarize them into a single positive, neutral, or negative sentiment.

First, I'll go through each tweet one by one. 

1. ""goog google inc . - class c volume URL $ goog $ amba $ wnr $ avgo goog nasdaq invest bossocial URL …"" – This looks like a company profile or a news about Google. The mention of Google in the query probably relates to its stock. It says ""class c volume,"" which might indicate investor interest, so this seems positive.

2. ""sfm sprouts farmers market inc . ideas URL $ sfm $ amba $ goog $ sqqq sfm nasdaq tradeideas"" – Similar structure as the first tweet, mentioning Sprouts and Google. This also sounds like a business news about tech companies, hence it's positive because of the focus on the company.

3. ""edz direxion daily emerging markets bear 3x shares ask size URL $ edz $ eem $ goog $ hcsg edz stockmarket stock"" – This tweet is from EDZ and mentions Dow Jones, which is related to US stock market. The word ""bear"" suggests a negative outlook or concerns about the economy. So this could be neutral or slightly negative.

4. ""compare brokers to find the right one for you - us tech giants URL $ aapl $ goog $ msft $ fb $ twtr spreadbetting cfd"" – This is from ABL (EDZ) and compares brokers, which might indicate uncertainty about the market environment, hence possible negative sentiment.

5. ""gild gilead sciences , inc . dividend URL $ gild $ aapl $ amba $ goog gild investing investing"" – GILD is part of Apple's portfolio, mentioning dividends. Dividends can be seen as positive because they indicate earnings and potential value. So this tweet adds to the stock's positive trend.

6. ""ta.to transalta corp . last trade URL $ ta.to $ goog $ sgyp $ uup ta.to stocks stock"" – This is from Transalta, which has a stock ticker. It mentions the last trade date, so it's likely providing market updates or financial news about Transalta's performance. This could be considered positive if it's related to the company, but since there's no direct mention of Google, it might have some neutral impact.

Now, I'll evaluate each tweet:

1. Positive (Google)
2. Positive (Sprouts)
3. Neutral (Dow Jones)
4. Neutral (Brokers and GILD dividends)
5. Positive (Dividends)
6. Maybe neutral or slightly negative (Transalta)

The overall sentiment is mixed because some tweets are positive, some are neutral or have mixed feelings. However, the most positive ones are from Google and its related companies like Sprouts, GILD, and Dividends.

But considering that each tweet is separate, maybe they all contribute to different aspects of the stock's performance. It's a bit uncertain, but leaning towards positive because there are mentions of tech stocks with dividends or earnings reports."
2015-07-13,Negative,"Alright, I'm going to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let's see what each tweet says.

1. The first tweet is about cvx chevron corp. It just mentions some company names and links without any positive or negative content.
2. The second tweet talks about ibio inc, which looks like it might be an independent financial institution that could drive stock performance if they perform well.
3. The third tweet mentions jpm, csx, yum, bac, etc., all of which are fintech companies known for growth in the tech sector.
4. The fourth tweet is a promotional message about platinum subscribers seeing gains from 40% over 10 months and inviting subscriptions. Positive.
5. The fifth tweet says there was an alert with a penny stock gain over 350% in 2 weeks, which sounds very positive for the stock.
6. The sixth tweet mentions Google's stock with some tech-related companies but no updates or new info.
7. This tweet is about Google helping build IoT campus by AT_USER, suggesting positive growth potential.
8. Google is downgraded to ""hold"" and its target price was reduced, which would be negative news.
9. This looks like a recent announcement about Google's performance in yen or another currency pair, but it's unclear if this affects the stock.
10. It just states that Google is nice, which might not provide any information relevant to the stock price.
11. The tweet is inviting others to join a game, but nothing specific is mentioned about stock performance.
12. It says penny stock newsletter alerts gained 350% in 8 days, similar to tweet 5.

Now, considering all these tweets, some are positive (like #4 and #5), some negative like #8, and others don't provide actionable info. The overall sentiment seems mixed but leaning slightly towards positive because there are clear mentions of growth and promotions. However, the downgraded target suggests uncertainty, which might push the stock lower despite positive signals. I'm not sure if the overall impact is significantly positive or neutral.

I think it's probably a mix, so [Neutral] makes sense as it reflects both positive and negative influences."
2015-07-14,Neutral,"Alright, let me go through this problem step by step to determine the overall sentiment of these tweets regarding the stock price of TSLA (tesla). 

First, I need to identify each tweet and extract the target stock symbol. Looking at the tweets, the main stock mentioned is TSLA throughout most of them. So, my target stock is Tesla.

Next, for each tweet, I'll break down whether it's a positive or negative factor. Let me go through each one:

1. The first tweet mentions ""hft algos broke 264.00"" in several places. HFT and algo strategies can have significant impacts on stock prices due to their high impact of decisions. However, this might be seen as a negative signal by some investors if they expect positive outcomes from these strategies.

2. The second tweet seems similar but doesn't specify the magnitude, so it's hard to determine definitively. Maybe neutral? But since I don't have numbers here, I'll keep it ambiguous for now.

3. This tweet is URLs about the future of entertainment, specifically mentioning $ amzn and $ atvi. While it might not directly affect Tesla's stock price, but if other companies are performing well, investors could see a negative sentiment because of potential market trends.

4. The tweet talks about early movers in the tech sector like JPM, KO, UBRN, etc., which can sometimes lead to positive news if these companies do well. However, without specific data, it's ambiguous but might lean towards neutral as there's not enough information given yet.

5. This tweet details Google's insider selling, specifically mentioning Ann Mather selling 2000 shares or so. Insider sales typically reduce the value of a stock, which is generally negative for investors looking at gains. So this could be a strong negative factor.

6. This tweet seems to discuss the price-to-sales ratio (PSR) and other metrics related to the S&P 500. It's about market trends and performance, not directly affecting Tesla. However, if the PSR is improving or worse, it might indicate a positive trend for the overall stock but not necessarily TSLA specifically.

7. Similar to tweet 6, this tweet also discusses Google's revenue growth metrics which could affect other companies in the tech sector, including Tesla. But again, without specifics, it's ambiguous.

8. This tweet is just a casual greeting about a ""cool kid"" on Twitter, not directly related to TSLA stock price changes. So probably no impact here.

9. Another mention of Google selling shares through HFT or alphas strategies, similar to tweet 5. This could lead to negative sentiment as it reduces investor confidence in the stock price. But without exact numbers, unsure if strong enough.

10. The tweet talks about platinum subscribers seeing significant gains over two weeks. This is a market trend related to the rise of platinum mining and its impact on prices. While it might cause some positive reactions elsewhere, Tesla isn't directly mentioned here.

11. This seems like an unrelated tweet discussing Facebook's close, which could lead to negative sentiment if Facebook's performance affects the broader tech sector. Again, not directly affecting Tesla.

12. Similar to 11 but with a user action about Google taking a closer look at costs as revenue growth slows down. This could indicate a trend in cost management that might have a positive impact on stock price due to better financial health. It's possible but uncertain without more context.

13. Another tweet from the same user discussing costs, so this is similar to 12 and likely contributes to negative sentiment if costs are rising or improving.

14. This tweet seems like a customer service message where someone thanks Google for their support with buy/sell orders. It's not related to stock price changes but rather a positive interaction, so probably no impact on TSLA.

15. Another user action about Google making buy/sell orders targeting specific stocks. It's similar to tweet 14 in intent, not directly affecting Tesla.

16. The tweet is about markets being dangerous with a 40% correction expected. This could lead to negative sentiment if the market is expected to decline. However, without knowing how this affects Tesla specifically, it's ambiguous.

Now, considering all these tweets: most of them are either about cost management (tweets 3-16) or insider selling (5). The only one directly related to Tesla is tweet 8, which just calls out a ""cool kid."" The others discuss broader market trends, potential risks, or general tech sector developments. 

Most of these tweets don't provide enough specific information about TSLA's performance. They could lead to uncertainty in sentiment but aren't definitive. Some are slightly negative (tweets 5,10,13) while others might be mixed or not impactful at all.

Given the lack of specific data on positive factors and limited info on negative ones, I think it's neutral. The tweets don't provide strong evidence for either a positive or negative trend affecting TSLA specifically."
2015-07-15,Positive,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on the future stock price of the companies listed. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet says that their penny stocks have gained 3,600% in 9 months and warns about a subscription URL. That sounds like good news because gains are expected, so positive factors here.

2. The second tweet mentions platinum subscribers saw stock alerts gaining 4,000% over 10 months. More growth here, reinforces the positive sentiment towards these stocks.

3. The third tweet is from syn synthetic biologics and mentions it's quoting on Google's stock. I'm not sure about this one—it could be a positive or negative factor based on their brand reputation, but it doesn't seem to directly talk about gains or losses.

4. The fourth tweet talks about RT-Dennyt launching a video subscription service targeting companies like Cvent and Nasdaq stocks. This seems like a strategic move to expand into other sectors, which could be a good sign if it's seen as positive by the market.

5. The fifth tweet mentions Google reporting earnings for Thursday. Positive news from a major company typically boosts investor confidence, so that's another positive factor.

6. The sixth tweet is about AT_USER's explanation of how Google boosted their Bluetooth beacons. This seems like something that could impact user behavior and potentially affect stock prices based on their competition or expansion.

7. The seventh tweet says Bank of America has a market cap URL. Market cap can indicate investor interest, but unless it's related to gains, it might not directly affect the stock price.

8. The eighth tweet is about YouTube launching a subscription music service, which could help attract new users in the video space and boost NASDAQ stocks, another positive point for investors.

9. The ninth tweet discusses South Korea's index changes with a percentage URL. This is more of an economic indicator, not directly related to the companies listed, so it might be neutral or negative depending on the data.

Putting this all together, the main positive factors are expected growth in penny stocks (tweets 1 and 2), strategic investments by biologics firms (tweet 3), earnings reports from major companies like Google (tweets 5), and expanding services from YouTube (tweet 8). The other tweets either present information without sentiment or relate to less directly mentioned sectors. So overall, there seems to be a strong positive trend in these areas."
2015-07-16,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets about Google's stock price and determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative for future performance.

First, let me go through each tweet one by one. 

1. The first tweet mentions something about earnings, so that could be a positive factor.
2. The second is more about financial percentages from 2015, which seems like a news event affecting current trends but not necessarily the future.
3. The third talks about options pricing for stock movement data, which could influence investor behavior and sentiment.
4. The fourth mentions Google beating revenue despite missing it, showing they're still doing well but might be affected by other factors.
5. This tweet introduces links to irrelevant topics like obnoxious ads or social media issues, which is a negative sign because it's not related to the stock.
6. Management change affecting Twitter's sale seems like bad news for investors because their stock would go down.
7. Mentioning tech giants allows access might be a distraction and could reduce investor confidence.
8. Penny stocks growing 360% in nine months is a strong positive indicator of growth, which is good for the company.
9. Link to unrelated topics about tech companies like Apple makes it hard to focus on the stock.
10. FB's dividend and trade ideas seem like positive signals but might not affect Google's stock price.
11. Google earnings reaction could either help or hurt depending on the outcome, so this is a mix of factors.
12. The tweet looks at $HTZ which I'm not familiar with, maybe unrelated.
13. Just $ goog doesn't provide any info about the company's performance.
14. Google closing high might indicate good news for investors as they're watching stock prices.
15. Apple Watch's buyers are mostly men and women winning their app battle, which is a positive sign but not directly related to Google.
16. The earnings report shows higher diluted EPS, which is a positive indicator of financial health.
17. $ goog focuses on the navy seals teaching communication skills, which might affect marketing or team performance but doesn't impact stock price.
18. Twitter's stock with SPDR P/E ratio could be overvalued or undervalued depending on earnings.
19. Google beating earnings for Q2 could positively influence future performance.
20. This tweet seems to discuss the pop-in trade, which is speculative and might not directly affect Google's stock.
21. A joke about working capital being used for cash needs can be a distraction but maybe reduces stress or investment.
22. The EPS data shows positive financial results, which is good for investors.
23. Google continuing with regulatory work could either help or hurt based on the situation.
24. Twitter's stock listed in multiple ETFs might indicate broader market performance affecting their price.
25. Spreading out of a Google hangout invite might not directly impact their stock but could affect their reputation and investor relations.
26. $ goog seeing significant earnings, which is positive for investors.
27. Google increasing resources for nascent areas like Nest and fiber could improve their product range.
28. A mix of ETFs showing positive financial results suggests good company performance.
29. Similar to tweet 23, with another regulatory situation.

After reviewing each tweet, I noticed that most are either positive or neutral factors related to Google's operations, earnings, or market trends. The negative tweets like number 5 and 7 are more about unrelated topics which negatively impact investor sentiment. The mostly positive tweets indicate good news for investors. However, some tweets show conflicting information or speculative aspects, but they're mixed in the overall analysis.

So, overall, despite some negative factors that might drag a bit, the majority of the tweets point towards positive signals for Google's future performance."
2015-07-17,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of etsy.com and then determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative. Hmm, let me go through each tweet one by one.

Starting with tweet 1: It asks why $goog is up today and mentions Google giving love yesterday. That seems like a casual comment, maybe not very informative for investors. I'm not sure about the sentiment here.

Tweet 2 talks about Google's alert regarding stocks. The URL looks like they're monitoring stock market trends. The word ""alert"" might be indicating some concern, but it's not clear if it's positive or negative towards the stock.

Tweet 3 says Google's price target went up by $750 and shares are now up to $googl. This sounds like a prediction based on market analysis, which could imply investor confidence in Google's future performance. That might be a positive signal for etsy, especially if investors are optimistic about Google.

But wait, I'm not sure yet how all these tweets contribute together. Maybe I should look at the overall sentiment without separating each tweet first.

Looking at each tweet, some mention price targets or updates (like tweet 3), others talk about earnings (tweets 7, 9, 25). Price targets could be a big indicator of investor sentiment. If multiple tweets are calling for an increase in Google's stock price, that's a strong positive sign.

But then, I also see some tweets suggesting that $goog and related stocks like $fnt or others might rise (tweets 14, 27). These can act as bearish signals if investors are anticipating growth elsewhere. However, the overall impact would depend on how these movements interact with each other.

Considering all of this, it seems like there's a mix of price target increases and earnings expectations. Google is expected to make significant gains, which could boost etsy's stock. But I'm not entirely sure if that's a strong enough positive or balanced with some bearish signals.

Wait, tweet 3 mentions that Google's all-time record in the past day was $65 billion, so they're expecting even more growth. That sounds like a positive outlook for investors, especially if it's expected to be a big move.

Other tweets are more about market conditions or earnings reports (like tweets 7, 9, etc.), which might indicate that while Google is doing well, there could still be some negative factors affecting the stock price. 

Overall, I think the combination of expectations for strong earnings and Google's potential growth makes it a positive trend. But since there are other signs like mentions of other companies rising, it might balance out. However, without knowing more about the broader market or economic indicators that could affect etsy, it's hard to say definitively.

I'm leaning towards this being a positive sentiment because the overall outlook is positive for Google and its future earnings potential."
2015-07-18,Positive,"Alright, let me break down how I approached this problem.

First, I needed to identify the target stock from the tweets provided. Scanning through each tweet, I saw that none explicitly mention a specific company except 'goog', which likely refers to Google. So, my target is Google Inc.

Next, for each tweet, I had to separate positive and negative factors. Positive factors were things like increased market cap gains, successful news about Google's performance, or any positive comments. Negative factors would include anything that might reduce investor confidence, like a loss of cash or negative reports.

Then, I evaluated the sentiment of each tweet. Sentiment was determined by whether the message was uplifting, downbeat, or neutral. For example, if a tweet mentioned increased profits or good news, it's positive. If it called out losses or bad earnings, it's negative.

I also looked at how Google had one of the best days in Wall Street history. This could be seen as a positive indicator for investors. The large shares gained in 8 days are significant, and the newsletter alerts mention gaining a lot of paper wealth from $ goog moves—this suggests strong fundamentals supporting the stock.

The lawsuit mentioned regarding Google's payment policies on Play Store gift cards might affect investor perceptions if it resolves any issues with their payments system. The market cap increases for companies like Tesla or Microsoft could be seen as positive signs, though some factors (like TSLA losing in a recession) might be negative.

However, the mention of making over $25k this week and collective earnings for TTF brothers were positive, especially if they're successful. But I had to consider the broader market context where other companies like Tesla and Microsoft are down or up.

Overall, while Google had strong positive indicators like market gains and featured lots of tweets about it, there were some negative points mentioned elsewhere that could influence sentiment. The overall sentiment seems mixed but leans towards positive due to the good news and strong fundamentals."
2015-07-19,Negative,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a set of tweets and wants to determine their likely impact on the stock price of a company. They've specified that I should analyze each tweet as a factor (positive or negative), assess the sentiment, and then combine these into an overall sentiment.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking through the tweets, one of them mentions ""goog,"" so I'll focus on the stock symbol goog.

Next, for each tweet, I'll separate the factors. I have six tweets in total. Let's go through them one by one.

1. The first tweet says $ goog: bullish analyst action from BMO capital. This seems like a positive factor because analysts are optimistic about Google.
2. The second tweet talks about platinum subscribers and their stock alerts gaining 4,000%. It also mentions ""subscribe today."" I don't have the exact details of this alert's impact on Google's price.
3. The third tweet by AT_USER says he's not expecting MSFT to be more ethical thangoog or AML. This is a negative factor because it suggests concerns about ethical practices, which could affect investor sentiment.
4. The fourth tweet discusses market cap data: $AAPL and $GOOG prices dropping while $MSFT is rising. This seems contradictory but I need to see if the overall trend affects Google's stock price negatively or positively.
5. The fifth tweet is a call option raise from jmp securities, not directly about the company, so maybe it doesn't impact Google's stock price much.
6. The sixth tweet raises Google's price target to $720.00. This seems like a positive factor as it's an update on expectations.

Now, for each tweet:

1. Positive: BMO analyst bullish on goog.
2. Not enough info from the alert's impact.
3. Negative: Concern about ethical practices in msft.
4. Mixed: market cap changes but not directly about google.
5. No mention of google, maybe it doesn't affect price much.
6. Positive: raising target price.

Assuming that all tweets are relevant to Google's stock, the positive factors include the analyst action and the price target raise. However, the negative factor (ethical practices) might have a significant impact. 

Considering all factors, even though there are some positives, the negative tweet about ethical practices could outweigh them. So, overall sentiment is negative."
2015-07-20,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of Google. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

Starting with tweet 1: It mentions Google's market value jumping by $65 billion. That's a positive factor, so it contributes to a positive sentiment.

Tweet 2 talks about Sony's smart TVs adding content to Brazil, focusing on 4K and ultrahd. There's some media mention here, but I don't see any direct link to Google or its stock, so I'm not sure how this affects the company. It could be a side note or just unrelated.

Tweet 3 discusses diversifying investments with CRAMER's money, mentioning Adepto shares and Google. This suggests a focus on diversification rather than negative news about the company, which might be neutral.

Tweet 4 talks about Facebook aiming for $100 in dollars, which is a positive outlook for their stock price. That should definitely boost Google's sentiment positively.

Tweet 5 mentions top tickertweets and Aapl's shares targeting a target price of $2015 on July 20. This could be a selling point or just generic buzz without specific impact on the stock.

Tweet 6 refers to Google's price target, which is another positive sign for its stock price. This should contribute positively.

Tweet 7 is about Tenaris investing in Google and Qld, suggesting an investment focus rather than negative news. So this doesn't seem to affect the company negatively.

Tweet 8 mentions Google's headquarters move from 1998 to 2015, which gives context but doesn't directly impact the stock price of Google itself.

Tweets 9-13 discuss Google raising prices or other investments, all positive signs that could boost the stock. These are solid points for a positive sentiment.

Putting it all together: All tweets are either reinforcing positive outlooks on Google's stock or providing context about the company without negative information. There's no indication of negative developments here."
2015-07-21,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out the impact on the stock price based on the tweets provided. 

First, I'll look at each tweet individually and note whether it's positive or negative. Then, I'll assess how each tweet affects investor sentiment. Finally, I'll combine these thoughts to determine if the overall trend is positive, neutral, or negative.

1. The first tweet mentions that AT_USER is doing well in the stock market. That sounds positive because it indicates good trading behavior.
2. The second tweet talks about gold miners being bearish on their index. That's a negative point for investors looking at energy or commodities.
3. The third tweet focuses on PayPal holdings, which could relate to financial services but not directly to tech stocks. It might be neutral since the focus is elsewhere.
4. This tweet suggests that GM is buying another company (ibm) in exchange for GM blending with Google. If GM is a competitor of GM, this could imply GM may see changes or growth, making it positive.
5. The fourth tweet discusses GS's financials and mentions their stock market info, which again sounds positive as it's about the company itself.
6. The fifth tweet talks about platinum subscribers gaining in penny stocks over 350% in two weeks. That's a significant positive move for penny stocks, especially if it's due to earnings or other good news.
7. The sixth tweet discusses Bos Social stock buzz with an update on erbb and bbda prices. That could be negative if the prices are dropping.
8. The seventh tweet is aboutclosing goog to 664.66 and a loss of $2,784,41. A loss in closing price suggests negative news for the stock.
9. The eighth tweet mentions closinggoog at 664.66 and a 9usd drop. Again, a significant decrease in price could be negative.
10. The ninth tweet talks about GS' traderz on bosocial stock buzz and updates on a $aapl price. That's positive as it relates to a company's performance.
11. The tenth tweet is about AT_USER last week ending with green surprise for options traders. This could be positive if expectations were high, or negative if it was unexpected.
12. The eleventh tweet discusses a risky play by shorting goog and shifting shares into twtr. That might indicate uncertainty in the market, which could be negative.
13. The twelfth tweet talks aboutgoog shares gaining on inquisitr. This seems positive as it's related to a company's performance.
14. The thirteenth tweet suggests that gm is nearly quadrupled and mentions news regarding multiple companies. If GM has significant growth potential, this could be positive.
15. The fourteenth tweet is about utilities selecting a spdr stock for the forum. This seems unrelated to tech or finance, so it might be neutral.
16. The fifteenth tweet about our penny stocks gaining 3,600% over 9 months and subscribing for future picks sounds positive as it's related to earnings.
17. The sixteenth tweet discusses an overlooked point regarding goog vs googl prices. If the difference is significant, this could be a trigger for investors' reactions.
18. The seventeenth tweet mentions no growth or profit from goog and its competitors, which indicates negative news.

Now, I'll assess each tweet's sentiment:
- Many tweets are positive about specific companies like GM, AAPL, GS, etc.
- Some have strong negative comments about gold miners, stocks, or price drops.
- There are mixed sentiments on certain tweets due to lack of information or conflicting updates.

Considering all these points, the company is mentioned multiple times as a competitor (GM), which could indicate growth. However, there are significant negative comments and price drops affecting other companies like GOOG and GOGL. The overall sentiment seems mixed but leaning towards positive because GM has strong performance. But with some serious concerns from others.

I think the impact isn't entirely positive since there are conflicting views on different stocks. It might still be slightly positive, but not overwhelmingly so."
2015-07-22,Neutral,"Alright, so I'm trying to analyze these tweets about stock prices for a given company. The goal is to figure out if each tweet is positive, neutral, or negative in impact on the stock price.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet because that's essential for assessing sentiment. Looking at the tweets provided:

1. ""alert : new social signal created on $ goog"" – Here, the symbol is $ goog.
2. ""holding $ crto calls for $ 65 + ~ trades a tad more than 3x ’ s revs , growing eps and revs 30 % yoy"" – This tweet mentions $ crto but doesn't specify the stock symbol, so maybe I need to check if it's related to goog. The term ""crto"" might be part of goog's stock ticker, like ""goog crto"", which is a major player in cryptocurrency.
3. ""abriendo 2 largos de $ goog a 675.31 usd idop 279419 vía AT_USER URL"" – This seems to mention $ goog, so the symbol is $ goog again.
4. ""why access a ticker when you could acesss a group of tickers - us tech giants"" – Again, I need the stock symbol, but the tweet isn't clear on that. It mentions tech giants, so maybe it'sgoog or something related like ycombs or google.
5. ""slv ishares silver trust yield URL $ slv $ utx $ goog $ xly slv stockmarket finance"" – The symbol here is $ slv.
6. ""ewz brazil ishares 52wk high URL $ ewz $ nugt $ feye $ goog ewz stock finance"" – Symbol is $ ewz.
7. ""goog google inc . - class c tick URL $ goog $ eox $ iyr $ spxs goog finance invest"" – Symbol is $ goog.
8. ""$ goog google inc URL $ cvc $ yrcw $ suwn $ fb $ cvc $ dirv $ cpst $ npwz pennystocks tradeideas $ cvc $ yrcw $ suwn $ aapl $ bac"" – This seems to mention multiple stocks, so likely $ goog is involved.
9. ""AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER see my last price target for $ baba $ gpro $ goog on URL"" – Symbols here are $ baba and $ gpro.
10. Same as tweet 9: ""AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER see my last price target for $ baba $ gpro $ goog on URL""
11. Same as previous tweets: ""AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER see my last price target for $ baba $ gpro $ goog on URL""
12. ""$ goog break that new issue reaction high!"" – Symbol is $ goog.

Now, I need to assess each tweet's sentiment towards the stock. Each tweet talks about something related to $ goog or other major stocks but doesn't explicitly mention a price target or an action taken regarding the company's performance.

Looking at each tweet:

1. New social signal on $ goog: This could be positive if it indicates increased buzz, which might affect investor sentiment.
2. $ crto calls for 65 with growth in eps and revs. If crto is $ goog, then this would relate togoog's performance.
3. $ goog mentioned again, so likely related.
4. Telling the user about multiple tech giants; since goog is involved, it might be neutral or slightly positive.
5. Silver trust yield, which could affect gold prices but not necessarily the company itself.
6. Ewz stock being up 52 weeks; if it's $ ewz for goog, then maybe a positive trend in a related stock.
7. Another mention of goog, so similar to others.
8. $ goog mentioned with multiple stocks, so likely related.
9-11: Telling users to target multiple tech companies, which could influence investor sentiment.
12. Net change in $ goog stock price.

Since none of the tweets explicitly mention a trade action or a price increase/decrease for the stock itself but instead discuss other factors like trends or economic indicators, I'm leaning towards a neutral overall sentiment. Each tweet provides information about related stocks or trends without directly impacting the target company's performance."
2015-07-23,Positive,"Alright, let's figure out how to assess the stock price impact based on these tweets. First, I need to identify the target stock. From tweet 14 and others, it seems like the user is focusing on the ""GOOG"" stock.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one. Tweets that mention GOOG will be considered. Now, looking at tweet 2: ""platinum subscribers saw their stock alerts gain 4,000 % in 10 months ! subscribe today : URL $ dpm $ frak $ goog"". This is a positive note with a big jump in alerts, so that's definitely positive.

Tweets like tweet 3 and 5 talk about the user's target price on GOOG stock. They mention prices increasing, which suggests they're likely long-term invested or watching for growth potential.

Tweets such as 6 to 14 all discuss the growth potential of companies related to GOOG, either through dividends or other metrics like valuations. These indicate confidence in their future performance.

However, some tweets are more negative. For example, tweet 7 and 8 talk about investment strategies or tech stocks that might not directly relate to GOOG. They could be speculative but also show a mix of positive and negative signals.

Overall, the majority of tweets support GOOG's growth potential, while others offer diversification opinions. The user seems well-informed but there are some divergent thoughts. So the overall sentiment leans towards a positive outlook."
2015-07-24,Neutral,"Alright, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. The user provided specific steps and an example output, so let me go through each tweet one by one.

First, the target stock is 'tree lendingtree inc.' Looking at the tweets, some mention $ goog stocks, others talk about 'nflx,' which I think stands for NFLX, maybe a different company. But since the target is tree lendingtree, I'll focus on the ones related to that or possibly other relevant companies mentioned like 'goog' and 'twtr.'

For each tweet:

1. ""tree lendingtree , inc . 52wk high URL $ tree $ jdst $ atml $ goog tree stocks finance"" – The mentions include 'goog', so this seems positive.

2. ""dronemaniac : rt financepress thefinancepress : $ goog how google inc is seeking to bring order to drone-filled skie … URL"" – This looks like a quote from Google about their efforts, which is positive, suggesting they're doing something good.

3. ""most popular tweets : $ amzn $ aapl $ fb $ cat $ sbux $ nflx $ goog $ twtr $ tsla $ ua nasdaq nyse stocks trading trending URL"" – Multiple companies are mentioned here, but the target is tree lendingtree. This seems neutral because it's not about tree lendingtree directly.

4. ""tree lendingtree , inc . 52wk high URL $ tree $ jdst $ atml $ goog tree stocks finance"" – Similar to tweet 1, mentions 'goog' so positive sentiment.

5. ""insy insys therapeutics , inc . summary URL $ insy $ gld $ pfe $ goog insy finance nasdaq"" – This is about Insy and Insys, but since the target isn't mentioned here, it's probably neutral as it's unrelated.

6. ""chuy chuy's holdings inc . e . p . s . URL $ chuy $ celg $ goog $ spxu chuy nasdaq tradeideas"" – Again, 'goog' is mentioned, so positive.

7. ""rt AT_USER wojicki : virtualreality is a whole new frontier , which is why we came out with 360 degree videos . $ goog AT_USER vidcon"" – This seems more promotional but doesn't mention the target company directly, so neutral as it's not specific to tree lendingtree.

8. ""$ nflx , $ amzn & $ goog : all have been $ 100 up post earnings . reasoned craziness ."" – Positive because it's stating that companies are rising after earnings, which is good for investors.

9. ""$ goog $ amzn $ nflx on achète avant résultats , on vend l'annonce ?ela y ressemble."" – Similar to tweet 7, mentions 'goog' but not the target company. Neutral as it's unclear.

So, tweets 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 are positive because they mention Google or talk about their stock performance. The others are neutral. There's a mix of positive and neutral sentiments."
2015-07-25,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. The user provided 10 tweets and asked me to analyze them to decide if each is positive, neutral, or negative regarding their stock's future performance. 

First, let me recall the steps outlined in the problem statement: identify the target stock from the tweet symbols, then analyze each tweet as Positive, Negative, or Neutral factors. I'll need to assess how each tweet influences investor sentiment and combine these to get an overall picture.

Looking at each tweet:

1. The first tweet mentions short sales and URLs for goog and celg. Not sure about short sales' impact yet.
2. The second tweet focuses on $ fb with analyst's comment via AT_USER, suggesting they're watching the stock from a user's perspective.
3. The third tweet talks about visa inc., investing, and trade ideas; mentions goog but not clear about intent.
4. Tweet 4 says our stock pick up over 300% since original release at .02, mentioning ibm and goog. This sounds like a significant positive news boost.
5. Tweet 5 mentions penny stocks with gains of 3600% in 9 months and offers subscriptions. Significant increase but might be speculative.
6. Tweet 6 is about $ v and gdx; not related to the target stock mentioned elsewhere, maybe a typo or unrelated tweet.
7. Tweets 7-14 list various stocks traded on nasdaq nyse, so no mention of our target stock here.
8. Tweet 8 talks about polgarstocks in gold shares, which could be positive if it's a dividend or investment appeal.
9. Tweet 9 mentions goog and vrng; not related to our stock.
10. Tweet 10 says 'super robot wars' is terrible on mobile, suggesting negative news affecting trading.

Now, putting this together:

- Tweets 4 and 5 are directly mentioning the target stock's performance from users, which would likely be positive because they're reacting to news. But tweet 5 has a huge percentage gain, which could be over the top; perhaps some investors think it's good but others might worry about the magnitude.
- Tweet 8 discusses gold shares as part of polgarstocks, which could have both positive and negative implications if it's investment-related or not.
- Tweets 10 is negative because mentions of bad news from a mobile app.

Considering these factors, tweet 4 gives a significant boost (over 300%), and tweet 5 shows a huge increase. The negative tweet at the end might bring some down but could be short-term. However, it's not clear if overall impact is positive or neutral because one tweet significantly boosts the stock while another reduces it.

So, I think the stock has mixed sentiment with both positive and negative elements."
2015-07-26,Negative,"Alright, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll look for the stock symbol mentioned in the tweets. The target stock seems to be AT_USER, as it's referenced multiple times. Now, each tweet provides factors and their assessments.

Looking at tweet 1: It mentions getting shelter on August 14, suggesting a potential event or news about the company. Positive factor here.

Tweet 2 talks about $ goog URL dish network and t-mobile snagging points to external deal crushers. This could indicate a planned acquisition or strategic move by a competitor. Both deal Crushing and acquisition factors are negative as they affect investor confidence. So two negative factors.

Tweet 3 mentions $study spy remains in chop zone since Jan 2015, suggesting the company's performance is somewhat down. Strong up doesn't mean positive; it depends on the context. Still, this seems like a neutral to mixed opinion because the performance isn't drastically improving or deteriorating, but not entirely negative.

Tweet 4 asks whether TSLA, AAPL, or even APPL will be involved in an innovation. This is more of a strategic question rather than a factual statement. It doesn't provide a clear positive or negative factor but may influence investor sentiment by signaling the company's focus on new developments.

Now, evaluating each tweet:

1. Positive: 1 point for shelter news.
2. Negative: Two points (dish network acquisition and deal crushing).
3. Neutral: Strong up indicates mixed, but not significantly bad.
4. Neutral: Strategic question, no clear fact but potential positive or negative based on innovation focus.

Combining these, the company is doing slightly better now because of APPL's acquisition, but there are mixed signals about TSLA and a strategic move without concrete data. The overall sentiment seems mixed, with some up and some down, so I'll lean towards Neutral."
2015-07-27,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about Google's stock and determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative for the stock price. Hmm, so first I need to extract the stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""cerrado 9 cortos de $ goog a 627.84 usd ganando 19.17 usd idop 287467 vía AT_USER URL"". The most common word here is ""goog,"" so I'll consider that as Google's symbol.

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate the factors and assess the sentiment. Let me go through each one by one.

1. The first tweet says $ goog a 627.84, gaining 19.17, and it mentions a mailto link from AT_USER. Not sure about the positive or negative here, but the price movement seems positive.
   
2. The second tweet talks about NASDAQ gains by 50%, which is good news for investors. They mention several companies, so that's another positive point.

3. Third tweet is more neutral. It says they don't need to wait until earnings, just search Google. This sounds like a strategic move rather than any specific positive or negative action on the stock price.

4. The fourth tweet lists various companies and mentions several stock symbols for Google. Again, this is about their product's performance, so it's likely positive.

5. Fifth tweet has some URLs but doesn't mention changes in price or significant news related to Google. It seems like just background information without any direct impact on the stock.

6. Sixth tweet repeats the fifth one, same as number five. No new info here either.

7. Seventh tweet lists several tech companies, including Tesla, Apple, Facebook, etc., and mentions Google along with their price movements. This suggests a strategic partnership or alignment between different tech companies, which can be positive for investors looking to buy into related sectors.

Now, combining all these thoughts: the first tweet is positive about the stock movement, but it's not very detailed. The second is also positive due to NASDAQ gains. Third and fourth are neutral since they're about search strategies. Fifth and sixth don't provide info on Google. Seventh adds a strategic perspective by mentioning partnerships.

So overall, there are mixed positive points from two tweets and some neutral, plus some background information without direct impact. I think the overall sentiment is leaning towards positive but with some neutral elements thrown in."
2015-07-28,Positive,"Alright, let's analyze these tweets to figure out how they'll impact the stock price of Google. The user provided a list of tweets, and I need to determine if each is positive, negative, or neutral towards Google.

First, I'll go through each tweet one by one.

1. "" $ tsla tesla URL $ aapl $ bac $ fb $ spy $ ge $ baba $ nflx $ c $ fe $ tsla $ f $ t $ uwti $ rad $ gild $ vxx $ ua x es_f $ googl $ goog"" – This seems like a list of stock ticker symbols, just listing the names. No positive or negative sentiment here, so it's neutral.

2. "" rt AT_USER google gives up on google + as a facebook rival : URL $ goog"" – The tweet mentions Google wanting to exit Facebook and is part of a competitive move. It seems like Google is looking to leave, which might impact the stock but not necessarily a significant positive or negative effect yet.

3. Another tweet: "" rt AT_USER google gives up on google + as a facebook rival : URL $ goog"" – Same structure as the second one. Again, Google is looking to compete with Facebook. I don't see any strong positive words here, just the idea of competition. So this might be neutral or slightly negative if they think it's good for their stock.

4. Another version: "" rt AT_USER google gives up on google + as a facebook rival : URL $ goog"" – Same pattern repeats. Again, Google is signaling to exit Facebook without any positive mentions.

5. "" this new website offers a simple way to make money from home ! subscribe here for free : URL $ cbl $ goog $ bll"" – This tweet talks about a new service offering something for free. It doesn't mention Google's performance or stock changes, just potential business expansion. So it seems neutral because the content isn't related to the company's financial health.

6. "" while i'm waiting on $ goog to come back down to earth on its valuation , i am … URL"" – The user is expressing hope that Google's valuation won't go up. They're a bit vague, but suggesting optimism about their stock's future value. This might indicate a slight positive outlook on the stock.

7. "" our stock alert on $ gequ gained as much as 525 % in the past 4 weeks ! huge news : URL $ gps $ nspr $ goog"" – This tweet clearly states that Google's stock has risen by over 500% in four weeks, which is a significant positive event. This strongly suggests a Positive sentiment.

Now, let's summarize each tweet's impact:

1. Neutral (just listing symbols)
2. Neutral
3. Neutral/Neutral (similar to above)
4. Neutral/Neutral
5. Neutral (no direct info on Google)
6. Slight positive (hope for future valuation)
7. Positive

Putting it all together, the majority of tweets are neutral or slightly positive, except some that don't touch on Google's performance. So the overall sentiment is leaning towards [Positive]."
2015-07-29,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price for a company based on their impact on the given stocks. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll identify each tweet and note if they're positive or negative. Positive tweets likely make people think positively about the stock, while negative ones do the opposite.

Looking at the tweets provided:

1. "" $ goog URL chris pine won't be playing green lantern - he's playing wonder woman's boyfriend URL"" – Hmm, this seems like a joke or irrelevant information. I don't see any positive or negative sentiment here.
   
2. "" AT_USER hi scott , thks for fl see my last price target for $ aapl $ twtr $ tsla $ goog on URL"" – This is from an AT_USER and they're informing others about the price targets for APlp, Twtr, TSLA, and Google. These are serious informational tweets aimed at investors. So positive.

3. "" adt adt corp . e . p . s . URL $ adt $ goog $ tsla $ ma adt tradeideas investing"" – This tweet is about a stock called ADT with some technical terms. It's likely making people think of stocks they might be interested in, so positive.

4. ""$ ocls $ oclsw spiking over 10 % today . price target of $5 $ goog $ utx $ met $ gmcr $ mgm $ hcn investors read URL"" – This is from an AT_USER and mentions the stock OCLW which has a spike, with multiple price targets set. It's serious information, so positive.

5. "" AT_USER hi katherina , thks for fl see my last price target for $ aapl $ twtr $ tsla $ goog on URL"" – Another informational tweet about price targets, so positive.

6. "" xly consumer discretionary select sector spdr company info URL $ xly $ rsp $ russ $ goog xly stock trade ideas"" – This is about an ETF called XLY which seems to be a financial instrument, possibly related to stocks. It's serious and makes people think of potential investments, so positive.

7. "" rt bosocial : toptickertweets $ twtr $ fb $ aapl $ spy $ gild $ yelp $ tsla $ goog $ uwti $ amzn sentiquant fintech 201507 … URL"" – This tweet is about multiple stocks and mentions financial tech companies, which might attract investors. It's positive.

8. "" AT_USER hi danielle , thks for fl see my last price target for $ aapl $ twtr $ tsla $ goog on URL"" – Another informational tweet with price targets, so positive.

9. ""$ amzn $ goog $ aapl $ fb $ ntfx $ gild accounts for more than half of $ 664billion in value added this year to the $ nasdaq"" – This is about market contributions and financials. It's serious investment information, so positive.

10. "" AT_USER hi steve , thks for fl see my last price target for $ aapl $ twtr $ tsla $ goog on URL"" – Another informational tweet with price targets, so positive.

11. "" AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER see my last price target for $ aapl $ tsla $ goog $ twtr on URL"" – This is multiple tweets from the same user calling out price targets without any negative sentiment.

12. "" AT_USER hi axis , thks for fl see my last price target for $ aapl $ twtr $ tsla $ goog on URL"" – Similar to others, informational tweet with price targets, so positive.

Now, looking at all these, most of them are either positive or neutral, especially the ones from AT_USER who are actively pushing price targets. Some tweets seem irrelevant but have no impact, like tweet 1 and the financial tech mention in tweet7. Most other tweets are focused on providing information about price targets which can be seen as positive because they're trying to keep investors informed.

So overall sentiment seems positive."
2015-07-30,Neutral,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the overall impact of these tweets on the stock price of a given company. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the tweets provided, they all mention "" goog "", which is Google, right? So I think that must be the stock we're focusing on here.

Now, looking at each tweet one by one:

1. The first tweet talks about hitting a price target for Google and some other companies. It seems like they might be encouraging investors to buy more shares because of their expectations.
2. Similarly, tweets 2-4 are all encouraging investor interest in Google with various mentions of stock prices and targets.
3. Tweets 5-10 seem to relate to projects or companies related to Google as well, again suggesting that Google is a key player being leveraged by others.
4. Then, there are some tweets about other stocks like FB (Facebook), TSLA (Tesla), TwTR (Twilio), and GOOG. These could be referring to different stocks, but since the output needs to predict the impact on "" goog "", I'm assuming they might not directly relate unless there's a typo or something missing.

Now, analyzing each tweet:

- The first four tweets are all about encouraging investors by setting price targets or just saying Google is doing well. They don't mention anything negative, so maybe positive.
- Tweets 6-17: Some talk about selecting sectors like SPDR, FB, TSLA, etc., and even mention things related to Google's stock. These seem like they could be supporting other stocks in the same sector or indicating that Google is doing well.

Putting it all together, these tweets are talking about encouraging investors in multiple companies but not giving a clear indication of Google's performance. They're more about what others are doing rather than how Google is performing relative to its competitors or overall market position.

So, without specific information on Google's recent news or earnings reports, financial news sentiment tends to be neutral because there's no explicit positive or negative statement about the company's profitability or market perception."
2015-07-31,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price of AstraZeneca (AAPL). Let's go through each tweet one by one and analyze their potential impact.

1. The first tweet says that Google has no power over Apple in the next few months and highlights the fun moments ahead. It seems like it's encouraging investors to watch, so maybe positive sentiment.

2. The second tweet mentions taking my last price target for AstraZeneca and others with me on Twitter. This is a direct mention of the stock, which could lead to an update in sentiment as people might follow the user or see it reflected elsewhere.

3. The third tweet is similar to the second but from Patricia instead. It also brings the stock targets along. Again, this seems like a direct mention that could affect investor interest and sentiment.

4. This tweet mentions C citigroup news related to AstraZeneca and others. While not directly related, it could influence investor views on the company's performance or management, which might impact stock price.

5. The fifth tweet talks about Sm Networks' ultrashort basic materials market cap. That seems unrelated to AstraZeneca, so maybe a bit of noise in sentiment but probably not significant enough to dominate.

6. The sixth tweet mentions Emylers and their filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This could signal regulatory changes or financial information that might be announced later about AstraZeneca. Positive news related to them could boost the stock.

7. The seventh tweet is similar to the first one, again encouraging investors by mentioning Apple. It's another avenue for positive sentiment since it's a well-known company and a major player in tech.

Putting it all together, while there are mentions of unrelated companies (like C citigroup, Sm Networks, Emylers) and some related ones (AstraZeneca itself), the primary signals from the tweets seem to be encouraging for investors. The last tweet about Apple is very clear and positive, which might give a significant boost. However, the other tweets mention different sectors or unrelated entities that could have mixed effects but don't overpower the main encouragement. So overall, it seems like the sentiment is positive.

I should make sure not to overlook the potential impact of unrelated information, but the most prominent ones are encouraging investors and mentioning the company in a helpful way."
2015-08-01,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on stock prices. Hmm, I'm new to this, but I'll take it step by step.

First, I need to extract the target stock from each tweet. Let's see:

1. The first tweet mentions ""spxl stocks"" and talks about S&P 500 bullish views with a 3x share buyout. Okay, that seems positive for spxl.
2. The second tweet is about yen trust in P/E ratio and investing. Not sure about that sentiment yet.
3. The third tweet says Google is giving up on their services as Facebook's rival. That sounds negative because it affects the company they're competing with.
4. The fourth tweet mentions OCN trade ideas. It focuses more on their own operations than stocks, so not too relevant for stock price impact.
5. The fifth tweet is about Altera, which doesn't seem directly related to any stock mentioned here.
6. The sixth tweet talks about refinancing loans, which affects a different sector but might influence investor sentiment.

Now, I'll analyze each tweet:

1. Positive factors: 3x share buyout and S&P 500 bullish. That's good signs.
2. Not sure about the yen aspect yet, maybe neutral?
3. Negative because Google is losing their competitive edge. Could hurt stock price.
4. Neutral since it's not related to any stock mentioned.
5. Not relevant here.
6. Positive or negative? Maybe slightly positive if trading ideas are beneficial, but overall not major.

Combining these thoughts: Two tweets are clearly positive, one negative and others neutral. So the overall sentiment isn't overwhelmingly positive or negative. It might be a mix of mixed signals. But since most are neutral except two positives and one negative, maybe it leans towards mixed. But the user asked for just [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Maybe leaning more towards Negative because of Google's move.

Wait, but spxl isn't in this list. Oh, no, wait—the first tweet has spxl stocks. So only two tweets are about spxl: 1 and 4. 2 is about yen trust, 3 is about Google, 5 is about Altera, 6 is about student loans.

So for spxl, the positive tweet is 3x share buyout from Google, which would be good news if spxl's stock goes up.

Overall sentiment: Positive from one tweet, but others are neutral. It could go either way depending on how each tweet performs.

But since most aren't positive or negative, maybe it leans towards Neutral? Or perhaps the main positive is enough to make it Positive overall."
2015-08-02,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me start by looking at each tweet and trying to extract relevant information.

The first tweet is ""uhs universal health services - class b open URL uhs $ goog $ uso $ cost uhs invest stockmarket."" I'm not sure what 'uhs' stands for, but it seems like the stock symbol is UHSS. The terms like ""class b"" and ""open URL"" might be part of another tweet or part of a URL for something else, which doesn't seem relevant here.

The second tweet is about an Android phone app, but I don't see any data related to that being connected to the stock of UHSS.

Looking at the third tweet, there's some words like ""macriconmirtha"" and ""mirthalegrand,"" which probably are just filler or typos. The mention of MACRICT (maybe a company name) and ""lucas elplandemacri romeoplay dragmedown fpv masclarohechaleagua"" isn't connected to UHSS.

The fourth tweet talks about CCL, which might not be related to the stock mentioned. The fifth tweet discusses EWA, an ex-dividend company with a typo in capitalization. Again, no connection here.

Sixth tweet mentions Microsoft beating Google in patent-royalty battles but doesn't relate it to UHSS.

The seventh tweet is about GMB, which I'm not familiar with; maybe a typo or irrelevant information.

Eighth and ninth tweets mention PEPLATA, which I think might be an acronym for something else. The last tweet talks about SPXL financials updated on August 1, 2015, but it's unrelated to UHSS either.

Since none of the tweets directly mention UHSS or any data that could influence its stock price, especially without clear positive or negative indicators, I can't conclude anything definitive. All tweets are about other companies or unrelated topics."
2015-08-03,Negative,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company based on [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

Starting with tweet 1: It mentions several companies like fxi, Google, Depo, BPCL, FB, P Krobb, etc. No clear information about positive or negative factors here, so probably neutral.

Tweet 2 talks about insider selling at Google and provides details on their actions. Insider selling usually lowers investor sentiment, which could lead to a negative impact. That suggests it's negatively affecting the stock.

Tweet 3 also mentions Google but focuses more on investor opinions and trade ideas. Again, insider activity and stock trading can be seen as negative signals for investors who are watching these trends.

Tweet 4 is about a company named Irbell or something similar with specific stock ticker. No info on positive or negative factors, so neutral.

Tweet 5 lists popular tweets related to stocks, but it's not about the target company. Maybe just general stock trading trends, which could be slightly positive if more people are interested, but not sure enough to categorize as positive yet.

Tweet 6 is about Google selling insider info on Facebook. This seems like insider selling again, so it's likely negative for investors.

Tweet 7 mentions that Apple and Google know what you want before you do, which could imply good information or product development, contributing positively.

Tweet 8 talks about landing a web page in top results but doesn't specify if the content is positive or negative. It might not be enough to decide yet.

Tweet 9 says Google retraced, thought it would bounce again. Retractions can sometimes indicate fear of market volatility, which could be considered negative by some investors.

So summarizing each tweet's sentiment:
1. Neutral
2. Negative (insider selling)
3. Negative
4. Neutral
5. Not about the company; might be positive if more interest but not enough.
6. Negative ( insider selling)
7. Positive (good info)
8. Not specific, so neutral
9. Negative

Combining all these, there are several negative tweets, some positive, and a few neutrals. The overall sentiment seems to lean towards negative because of the significant insider selling in tweet 2, 6, 7, etc."
2015-08-04,Positive,"Okay, so I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company and decide if it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the tweets, the main ones are related to different companies: goog, jpm, platinum, aapl (which is Apple), gm, gm $ gpc $ gnw $ gild $ gs, and a couple of others. The user didn't provide all the symbols, but I can assume each tweet mentions one or more companies.

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. Positive tweets might mention good news, like successful launches, increased revenues, or new products. Negative ones would likely talk about issues, losses, or decreased earnings.

For sentiment analysis, I have to evaluate how the information is received by investors. If the company's fundamentals are improving, it could be positive. If there are signs of decline in revenue or profits, that might swing it negatively.

Looking at tweet 1: ""goog google inc . - class c company info URL $ goog $ ctix $ eog $ rxmd goog pennystocks pennystocks."" This seems more like a call to action or a mention without much positive or negative content. It might be about expanding into penny stocks, which could be positive if it's a niche segment.

Tweet 2: ""jpm j . p . morgan chase & co . 52wk high URL $ jpm $ rsx $ lxrx $ goog jpm tradeideas stock."" Positive here is about trading ideas and reaching 52 weeks. This sounds like a positive trend because it's showing growth potential, which can drive stock price.

Tweet 3: ""platinum subscribers saw our picks gain 4,000 % in 10 months ! subscribe today : URL $ dpm $ frak $ goog."" The mention of increasing subscribers and the offer to subscribe makes this positive. High subscriber numbers can indicate strong demand for services, which could boost the stock price.

Tweet 4: ""most popular tweets : $ aapl $ twtr $ fb $ dis $ goog $ nflx $ amzn $ lxrx $ tsla $ gs nasdaq nyse stocks trading trendi … URL."" This is a list of popular tweets with various companies. It's more about trends and stock movements, so it's probably neutral because while the content is relevant, it doesn't directly talk about positive or negative factors.

Tweet 5: ""$ shak shake shack URL $ fslr $ bidu $ dis $ mcd $ msft $ fb $ ebay $ ea $ aapl $ avgo $ goog $ ecig $ swks $ fslr goog stockmarket."" The mention of Apple and Facebook indicates growth, so this is positive.

Tweet 6: ""$ ebay $ esrx $ fast $ fb $ flir $ goog trade long or long + short positions from the nasdaq , up to 1500 % since 2010 . … URL"" Here, eBay's stock has significant trades. Upgrades in performance could be positive but might also depend on other factors like competition. This tweet is speculative, so it's considered neutral because the impact isn't clear.

Tweet 7: ""our penny stock picks have gained 3,600 % in 10 months ! check out tomorrow's new pick : URL $ dpm $ frak $ goog"" Similar to tweet 1 and 3, this is encouraging about a company's growth potential. It shows optimism, so it's positive.

Tweet 8: ""$ gm $ gpc $ gnw $ gild $ gs $ gt $ googl $ goog $ gww usa the next greece ! URL … … … … … … URL"" The mention of Greece could be a negative sign if there are concerns about economic recovery or policies. However, GM and others are being sold short, which might indicate potential stock movements. It's ambiguous without more context, so it's neutral.

Putting it all together: Tweets 2,3,5,7 are positive because they show growth, trends, or strong sentiment towards certain companies. Tweets 1,4,6,8 have mixed signals but leaning towards uncertainty, with some positive elements like subscriber increases and stock trades. Since the majority of tweets point towards positive outcomes (like high trading activity, subscriber growth, Apple presence), the overall sentiment is likely Positive."
2015-08-05,Neutral,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of the target company, which seems to be PFE since I see TRCP andgoog mentioned in the first tweet. The output needs to be either positive, neutral, or negative.

First, looking at each tweet one by one:

1. The first tweet is about a forum update on the $z stock from Aug 5, 2015. It mentions multiple companies: TRCP,goog,Hyg. I don't have specific information here, but it's possible that this could be news related to PFE, maybe stock market trends or earnings.

2. The second tweet talks about Google making a $1 billion profit drop report. That might indicate some change in company performance, which could affect investor sentiment towards the stock. A drop in profits might lead people to expect lower future prices, suggesting negative sentiment.

3. Third tweet mentions a penny stock alert gaining 550% in six weeks. This seems like a positive news event, especially if it's related to PFE, implying potential for higher stock price. But I'm not sure about the direct impact on PFE unless it's a separate company.

4. Fourth tweet is from Chegg, which is unrelated to PFE. It mentions a high-growth play in education, which could affect their stock but might not directly relate to PFE.

5. Fifth tweet talks about stock picks gaining 360% over 10 months, with new picks coming. This seems like good news for investors in PFE, implying potential positive impact on the stock price.

6. The sixth tweet is about Google's news related to Chegg, similar to tweet 4. Doesn't directly relate unless there's some connection I'm missing.

7. Seventh tweet lists multiple stock symbols, including IBM and others, which are unrelated to PFE.

8. Eighth tweet mentions that Apple and Google could disrupt the telecom industry, impacting their respective stocks but not directly affecting PFE.

Now, combining these tweets: The first tweet is general market info, second is about Google's financials, third shows a positive event, fifth is about stock picks being great. The other tweets are unrelated or mention other companies.

Positive factors include Apple and Google disrupting the telecom industry, which could affect their own stocks but not necessarily PFE directly. The drop in Google profits might lower investor confidence if it affects how others perceive PFE's performance.

Negative factors don't seem to be present here. Neutral is possible if there are conflicting signals or neutral impact. But overall, since Apple and Google are mentioned as disruptive, they might increase market volatility but not necessarily decrease PFE's price unless the disruption impacts PFE directly, which it doesn't seem to.

So, considering that Apple's disruption could cause investors to sell off their telecom stocks, perhaps indirectly affecting any sector PFE is in. But if PFE is unrelated, then maybe no impact from that. However, the stock picks being great (tweets 5 and 8) might suggest good investment opportunities, which could boost PFE's price.

Wait, but tweet 8 is about the telecom industry disruption, not PFE itself. So unless these disruptors specifically target PFE, their impact isn't directly on PFE. However, if the disruption affects related companies, it could influence stock prices. But since I don't have that context, it's hard to tell.

Overall, positive factors like Apple and Google disrupting telecom are interesting but not specific to PFE. The drop in profits might indicate a need for caution, which is negative in general. So maybe the overall sentiment leans towards neutral because while there are positive events affecting other areas, the direct impact on PFE's stock isn't clear or certain.

But let me think again. If Apple and Google disrupt the telecom industry, that could increase competition in PFE's area if they're part of the same industry. For example, if both companies affect a subset of the market, it might lead to increased prices for related stocks. But unless I know how these disruptions are impacting PFE specifically, it's hard to say.

Given that, perhaps the positive factors (like Apple and Google) could be seen as good investment opportunities or strategies that could boost PFE's stock. So maybe there's an indirect positive impact. But without knowing the exact relationship, it's tough. Also, the other tweets about Google profits and tech stocks might not directly relate unless they're part of the same company.

So in conclusion, considering the positive factors related to tech disruption and negative impact from the profit drop on general markets, I think the overall sentiment is [Neutral]."
2015-08-06,Neutral,"Okay, I need to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the future stock price of a given company. Let's break down each tweet and analyze their factors.

Starting with the target stock symbol from all the tweets. Looking through the list, the most common symbols are ""GOOG"" (Google), ""MSFT"" (Microsoft), and others like ""Berkshire Hathaway"", but since I'm focusing on one company, let's say ""GOOGLE"".

Each tweet is a factor for Google. Now, breaking down each tweet:

1. **brk / b berkshire Hathaway , inc . bid size URL $ brk / b $ enzr $ goog $ gib / a.to brk / b stock investing**  
   This seems like a financial analysis tweet about something related to investment. It mentions stock investing and possibly the company's financials. Not sure if it's positive or negative, but some mentions of investors could indicate mixed feelings.

2. **tips and tricks to choose a laptop for school or college students - URL $ aapl $ goog $ msft $ amd $ nvda $ intc**  
   This is marketing advice. It suggests using laptops for students, which might be positive if it's about educational tools. But depending on the context, maybe neutral.

3. **$ goog nokia's here maps sale could hurt google inc . ' s driverless ambitions : nokia's here maps sale could hurt ... URL**  
   This tweet is critical and analytical. It criticizes Google's driverless technology because of a maps sale at Nokia. The negative part is Google, which can cause concerns about profitability. So this seems negative.

4. **$ shak shake shack URL $ xlk $ csco $ fit $ fb $ lk share finance $ goog $ bnd $ cnr.to $ tsla $ … URL**  
   This tweet lists various stocks to invest in, including Google and others. It's a positive sign as it's encouraging trading. But the mention of ""shak shake shack"" might be a typo or something confusing, but likely just wording.

5. **$ shak shake shack URL $ xlk $ csco $ fit $ fb $ lk share finance $ goog $ bnd $ cnr.to $ tsla $ googl trade ideas stockholm**  
   Similar to tweet 4, it lists stocks and encourages trading Google. Positive sentiment here too.

6. **rt AT_USER $ nmxs should go here . it's gaining momo big time nyse $ goog currencies URL**  
   This is a recommendation for RT stock. The positive part is that it might gain in value, so this seems like a positive factor.

7. **goog google inc . - class a financials URL $ goog $ tvix $ biib $ sds goog tradeideas finance**  
   Again, mentions financial performance of Google with a focus on class A stocks. This could be negative if the company is undervalued or has good growth potential.

8. **$ shak shake shack URL $ goog $ vale $ amgn $ googl goog finance stocks $ sina $ acrx $ umpq $ axp $ lly $ nke $ cmcsa $ mdlz**  
   This list of stocks includes Google and others. Positive because it's encouraging trading, but mentions that ""vale"" might be a typo or confusion.

9. **five minute trades - $ spy $ qqq $ dia $ iwm $ aapl $ tsla $ gpro $ gld $ uso $ nflx $ googl $ goog $ gdx $ dust $ jdst $ xlf $ ba … URL**  
   This is active trading advice for various stocks, including Google. Positive because it's encouraging trading.

10. **rt satish_kumar 21 : yelp : a value trap without a lot of value URL $ yelp $ trip $ goog $ googl $ fb … URL**  
    The tweet talks about a value trap in the stock market, which could be negative as it might lead to losses if bought incorrectly.

Looking at all these, Google is being discussed frequently. There are mentions of its financials, analyst opinions, and potential trading tips. However, some tweets suggest a risk or issue with Google's technology (tweet 3) and others provide trading opportunities (tweets 5-9). Positive factors come from the emphasis on investing and avoiding value traps.

I think overall sentiment leans towards positive because there are enough stocks recommended for trading and mentions of investor opinions about Google. But some negative aspects like potential issues in their technology might balance it, but overall, the impact seems mixed with a slight push towards positive."
2015-08-07,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided a set of tweets along with some rules on how to process them. Let me go through this step by step.

First, from what I understand, each tweet is about a stock symbol, but since it's not specified in the given tweets, maybe that's something I need to figure out. But looking at the first tweet, it mentions ""djpy monthly chart $ usdjpy..."" which seems like a currency pair or index projection. The user wants me to extract the target stock symbol from these tweets. 

Looking at the first tweet: ""usdjpy monthly chart $ 122 projection $ usdjpy $ jpy $ usd $ goog $ aapl $ fb $ f $ tsla $ twtr $ mu $ conn $ amzn $ bax $ wfm $ spy URL."" So it mentions multiple stock symbols like usdjpy, jpy, usd, goog, etc. The most relevant symbol here is USDX (usd) and USAP (apl), as the price projections mention Google and Facebook.

Now, each tweet has factors and sentiments. I need to analyze each one individually and then summarize overall sentiment. 

Let's go through each tweet:

1. **USDX monthly chart $ 122 projection...** - Positive because it's a long-term projection, which is often seen as optimistic.
2. **$ goog URL the social and mobile workplace : climate change is real URL** - Negative because it's critical information that could drive stock prices related to technology.
3. **AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER see my last price target for $ spx $ aapl $ fnma $ gpro $ goog $ fb on URL it's free** - Positive, they're seeing targets and maybe encouraging investors.
4. **Same as above but without 'free' – probably still positive because it's encouraging the stock.**

7. **xlf financials select sector spdr volume $ xlf $ goog $ xray $ petx xlf stock stockmarket – Positive, positive news about the company.
8. **xlv health care select sector spdr investing opinions URL** - Negative because it's related to health care which might be a downfield or negative sector.
9. **AT_USER how can google unlock shareholder value ? URL Google shares and stock market infographics – Positive, attracting investors interested in tech companies.
10. **rt AT_USER xli industrials select sector spdr ex-div date** - Negative, as the ex-div date could affect investor expectations.

12. **top tickertweets $ aapl $ spy $ aqxp $ nflx $ fb $ spx $ tsla $ twtr $ googl $ goog sentiquant fintech 20150807 12:04am:04am** - Positive, lots of tech stocks. The mention of fintech adds to positive sentiment.
13. **hed.to horizons betapro s & p / tsx capped energy bear plus etf shares URL. So, negative because energy and tech could impact the stock negatively.
14. **myec myecheck , inc . shares $ myec $ adre $ goog $ alrm myec investing stocks** - Positive, focusing on specific sectors or companies.
15. **$ goog $ twx : time warner inc hbo now finally delivers ios, android support ... URL. So, positive about product availability impacting revenue.

17. **new investing and tech site , enjoy ! URL $ dis $ goog $ googl $ cost investments stocks google apple nexus googlefi. Positive, encouraging investment in tech.

Now, tallying up each tweet's sentiment:

- Positive tweets: 1,2,3,4,5,6 (but wait, no – 6 is negative)
Wait, let me recount. Actually, the user didn't provide all 17 tweets. From the given tweets, it's only 17. But from the list, I see 9 positive tweets.

Negative tweets: 2,6,8
Positive tweets after correction: Let's check each:

1. Positive
2. Negative
3. Positive
4. Positive
5. Positive
6. Negative
7. Positive
8. Negative
9. Positive
10. Negative (Wait, tweet 10 is about ex-div date)
11. Positive
12. Positive
13. Negative
14. Positive
15. Positive
16. Positive
17. Positive

So total positive tweets: 1,3,4,5,7,9,11,12,14,15,16,17 → that's 12 positive.

Negative tweets: 2,6,8,10,13 → five negative.

Neutral? Well, looking through, none of the tweets mention neutral terms except maybe some, but in these tweets, all seem to have clear sentiment. So overall, mostly positive.

Thus, overall sentiment would be Positive."
2015-08-08,Neutral,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me start by looking at each tweet one by one and see what information they're conveying.

The first tweet mentions that their penny stock picks have gained 550% in five weeks and suggests how to get new picks early, ending with a URL involving $ gps, $ nspr, and $ goog. The second tweet says the stock has grown 3600% over ten months with new picks coming from $ ibm, $ goog, and $ aapl, also using URLs for those stocks. 

The third tweet is about market vectors on SEMI stock, mentioning SEMI, $ smh, $ goog, etc., and the fourth one talks about GOOG and mentions class C news about Class D stocks. The fifth tweet is about UUP as a bullish fund based on the dollar index.

Looking at these, I notice that multiple tweets are discussing various tech companies but none of them seem to mention any specific stock or provide specific information about it. They're more general in nature, talking about changes in stock prices over time and suggesting strategies or investments. 

Since there's no explicit mention of a specific company or its stock price movements, the sentiment isn't clear from these tweets. It seems like they might be providing background info for analysis or investment tips without indicating any positive or negative impact on an actual stock.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I think the overall sentiment is neutral because there's no direct indication of support or concern regarding a specific stock."
2015-08-09,Positive,"Okay, so I have to analyze these tweets and figure out if they're positive, negative, or neutral in terms of impact on a stock's future price. Let me start by breaking down each tweet.

First tweet: ""$ goog URL media distribution overload . the peril and opportunity of mobile consumption . URL"". Hmm, this seems like it's talking about the state of media distribution for Google, specifically on mobile. The mention of ' Median income or something' but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. It looks more like a commentary or opinion piece about how media is distributed and whether it's good or bad.

Second tweet: ""our penny stock picks gained over 550 % in 5 weeks ! see see how to get our new picks early : URL $ erbb $ bbda $ goog"". This one seems like a sale announcement. The user is saying their penny stocks have grown by 550% over five weeks and they want more information on how to get the updated picks. That sounds like a positive action, maybe encouraging investors to take advantage of this growth.

Third tweet: ""$ followers made 505 % profits from $ aren superalert of july 23 , 2015 $ rafa $ hcti $ simh $ nflx $ goog $ fb URL"". This is also looking like a commentary, perhaps discussing the success or challenges with Google's performance around July 23, 2015. It might be critical or positive depending on what the content inside the URL suggests.

Now, to analyze each tweet: The first one seems more about market trends and media distribution, which could impact stock performance in mobile app usage but may not directly affect a penny stock. The second is clearly a promotional sale for their stocks. The third seems to be analyzing past performance, which could indicate future potential or risks.

Putting it together, the first tweet's content doesn't seem to directly relate to their stock. The second is a clear promotion, positive in nature. The third is about past performance but might give insights into future potential. Combining these, the main impact seems to be from the second tweet, which boosts their earnings, leading to growth.

So overall sentiment should reflect that boost, making it positive."
2015-08-10,Positive,"Alright, so I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of Alphabet Inc. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. **First Tweet**: The tweet mentions that Alphabet's CEO is impressed with Google and Sunar Pichai from Google. It also adds that they'll be okay despite some tough moves. This seems positive because it shows support for the company without any negative signs. It's about their performance and future plans, which could indicate confidence.

2. **Second Tweet**: It talks about the Google AI ecosystem being transformed into a Google Forms business. That’s interesting because it's moving towards AI-focused products but not directly related to Alphabet itself. Maybe this is just an unrelated update.

3. **Third Tweet**: Similar to the second one, it mentions changes in ad formats threatening Alphabet Inc.'s ecosystem, which could be seen as something negative if Alphabet is affected by these changes, impacting their operations and possibly stock price.

4. **Fourth Tweet**: This lists several stocks related to Alphabet, like Google, Apple, Amazon, etc. It doesn't mention anything directly about the company itself but provides information on other companies Alphabet operates. So, maybe it's more about diversification or industry news rather than a direct impact on Alphabet.

5. **Fifth Tweet**: RTs AT_USER and mentions upcoming ceos for Alphabet. This could be a bit of an update from Alphabet employees to fans, which is generally considered positive because it shows they're optimistic and committed. It might also attract media attention if the CEO looks great.

6. **Sixth Tweet**: Looks like a forecast with ""revisions"" in capitals. That's usually seen as positive because it suggests confidence about future trends or market expectations, which can influence investor sentiment positively.

7. **Seventh Tweet**: Talks about an AI-related news from $ goog and mentions analyzing the AI market. This is speculative but not directly related to Alphabet, so maybe a neutral outlook since there's no direct impact on Alphabet itself.

8. **Eighth Tweet**: Looks like a daily stock update for SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust. While this might be about broader market trends or sector news, it doesn't mention Alphabet and probably isn't directly affecting the company unless related to other sectors.

9. **Ninth Tweet**: Similar to the sixth one but uses ""the AI market …"" which is a bit vague. It mentions Google's changes in their ecosystem. Again, not directly related to Alphabet but possibly indicating broader tech trends that might influence the industry or stock price indirectly.

10. **Tenth Tweet**: RTs AT_USER asking about $ googl and asks if Google has more Q&As. This seems more like a casual question from fans, which is generally positive as it shows enthusiasm for Alphabet's products. It could boost morale but doesn't have extreme sentiment.

11. **Eleventh Tweet**: Uses Larry Page to suggest seeing the note. It's a bit unclear and possibly unrelated, so maybe not affecting the stock price significantly.

12. **Twelfth Tweet**: Talks about Google changing their business structure, mentioning shares rising for Alphabet. This is another industry update that might influence Alphabet indirectly by affecting other companies in the tech sector but not directly Alphabet itself.

13. **Thirteenth Tweet**: Looks like an AI-related article or statement, which again isn't directly related to Alphabet unless it's about broader AI trends impacting their products or services.

14. **Fourteenth Tweet**: Similar to the thirteenth, just using different capitalization letters. Still not directly affecting Alphabet but could be part of a broader tech trend.

15. **Fifteenth Tweet**: No content mentioned, so it might be a placeholder.

16. **Sixteenth Tweet**: Suggests that leaving it up to a company with the most complex name to create an alphabet-like name. This is speculative and not directly related to Alphabet's performance or future plans.

17. **Seventeenth Tweet**: Refers back to $ goog, which is about Google's performance but doesn't impact Alphabet unless there are market overlaps.

18. **Eighteenth Tweet**: Looks like a forecast or news update on Alphabet stock. It mentions trading under $ googl and $ goog on NASDAQ, suggesting that Alphabet might be listed on NASDAQ in the future, which could boost their stock price.

19. **Nineteenth Tweet**: Nothing is mentioned here, so it's likely a placeholder.

20. **Twentieth Tweet**: Recruitment of Twitter Inc.'s co-founder, Joaquim Verges. This shows the company expanding into another space but doesn't directly relate to Alphabet itself unless there are strategic synergies or partnerships that could impact their stock price.

Now, putting this all together:

- Positive tweets: The first, sixth, eight, nine, twelfth, and eighteenth tweets focus on Alphabet's CEO, industry updates, and potential future expansions. These seem positive because they provide insights into the company's operations, industry trends, or strategic moves.

- Negative tweets: There are none that directly indicate a negative impact. Most of them are either about industry news, forecasts, or unrelated content like product launches or partnerships.

- Neutral tweets: There are no neutral ones; all tweets contribute to the overall positive outlook based on various positive factors."
2015-08-11,Neutral,"Alright, I need to figure out how to handle this user query. Let me break it down.

First, looking at the initial message, there's a long conversation between a user and some characters on Twitter. The main topic is about Google becoming Alphabet and various reactions from different people. The user has listed a series of tweets, questions, and comments related to this event.

The task is to generate an overall sentiment conclusion for each tweet or comment but ultimately conclude with a single line stating the overall sentiment using [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. So, it's about determining whether all these individual pieces are positive, neutral, or negative in their own right and then summarizing that into one final statement.

Now, I need to consider how each part of the conversation affects the overall sentiment. Let me go through them one by one:

1. The initial tweet about Google changing names seems pretty straightforward. It's just a relabeling without any negative implications. So, this should be considered neutral or positive since it doesn't express concern.

2. The follow-up question is interesting but doesn't add much new information beyond what was already stated in the first tweet. Still, not really impacting sentiment.

3. Comments from users like 'Larry Page' and others seem to express frustration about Google losing its identity without any positive reactions. So, these are likely negative comments.

4. The follow-up comment is similar, stating that Google needs a new name and that this decision was intended for the good of the company. Positive sentiment here because it's about what's done positively.

5. Other users are confused by the name changes but seem uncertain whether this will have any positive impact on the company. So, some confusion without clear positives or negatives.

6. Another comment is a bit vague and doesn't add much, so maybe neutral.

7. The user is worried that Google might lose its voice if Alphabet takes over. Again, negative sentiment because they're questioning the implications.

8. More uncertainty about Alphabet's role and impact. Negative sentiment here too.

9. There are comments about how Alphabet could be a better fit than Google, which implies potential positives but some uncertainty.

10. The user is concerned that the name change might make them look bad on social media, though this seems more like a minor concern rather than negative sentiment.

11. Comments from users who think Alphabet will take over quickly are negative because they expect immediate changes.

12. Some frustration at not being given time to update with new info about Alphabet's role.

13. Positive comments about Alphabet looking forward to the change and building on Google's legacy suggest some positivity here.

14. The user expresses confusion but doesn't express strong feelings, so neutral.

15. Negative comments because they don't think Google will move quickly enough.

16. Uncertainty again, as users are unsure about Alphabet's potential impact.

17. Positive sentiment from others when considering Alphabet's role and the company's future.

18. Comments questioning if Alphabet will take over immediately or if Google can manage on its own suggest uncertainty but some confusion.

19. Another comment expressing hope that Alphabet can change quickly, which is positive.

20. Positive comments about Alphabet's potential to improve and make Google better are expected, so positive sentiment here too.

Now, compiling all this, I notice that while some tweets have strong positives or negatives, others are neutral or uncertain. The overall sentiment isn't clear-cut because both sides (alphabet vs. google) have their opinions. There's a mix of varied reactions—some are concerned about name changes, others are positive but not extreme.

Therefore, the best conclusion would be [Neutral] because the overall sentiment doesn't lean strongly in any one direction; there's a mix of emotions expressed across different tweets."
2015-08-12,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on the future stock price of a company. Let me break it down step by step.

First, each tweet is separate, and they all mention different factors related to Google's performance. I need to analyze each one individually before combining them for an overall sentiment.

Starting with tweet 1: It talks about various companies driving the stock market but specifically mentions $fb, $goog, and $ggl. The URL links seem to be part of a website analysis, so maybe it's about something else related to Google or its competitors. I'm not sure what exactly this is, but perhaps it's unrelated.

Tweet 2: Google upgrades their overweight position at MS. That sounds like they're increasing their investment in the stock, which might indicate positive sentiment because more money could go into growth stocks. The URL mentions something about a bullish signal from spy, which suggests that there's some confidence or expectation of higher performance.

Tweet 3 and 4 are similar to tweet 2 with multiple companies mentioned. They all mention Google going up, so it looks like they see potential for increased market value and might be selling some shares. This could lead investors to buy more Google stock, which would be positive sentiment.

Tweet 5 mentions Google up in a good agreement with a bullish signal from spy. If spy is a separate entity or a leading ETF, this indicates that there's a signal suggesting higher returns, so it reinforces the belief that Google will perform well. This would likely contribute to positive sentiment.

Tweet 6 repeats tweet 5, so reinforcing the same information again, which strengthens the overall belief in Google's future performance.

Tweet 7 repeats tweet 3 and 4 as well, so this is consistent with the trend where Google is up, leading to more people buying shares.

Tweets 8, 9, 10 are about gold and various other companies. It doesn't mention Google, so maybe it's unrelated or not directly impacting Google's stock price negatively or positively yet.

Tweet 11 mentions opening large amounts of $ goog with specific prices, which could be seen as a positive sign that the company is strong. The details might show that they are stable and have some fundamentals good for them.

Tweets 12 and 13 mention Google becoming Alphabet and other companies. This aligns with the idea that Google is expanding into new markets or products, which can boost their stock price. It's a positive sign for growth.

Tweet 14 and 15 repeat tweet 13, so this further supports the expectation of higher performance from Alphabet and related companies.

Tweets 16 to 20 are about other stocks, possibly unrelated to Google. They don't mention any specific changes in Google's stock price or positive news about their operations. So these might be neutral or negative because there's no direct impact on Google.

Now, considering all these tweets: most of them are about Google increasing their investments, seeing strong news, and confirming previous signals that show higher performance. There's also some mention of Alphabet expanding into the tech space. 

But there are other companies mentioned like $ goog, $ aapl, $ pcln, etc., but those don't directly relate to Google. So it seems the primary focus is on Google, which is up in various ways and they're expanding their operations. This suggests that there's positive sentiment towards Google, both in terms of investment and potential expansion.

So putting it all together: Google is increasing funds, showing confidence in future performance, Alphabet is expanding into tech sectors, which are positives for the overall market. There isn't any negative information pointing to a downturn or declining stock price, so I think the overall sentiment should be positive."
2015-08-13,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to determine the impact on the stock price of the given company based on the provided tweets. I'll go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol from the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER google alphabet a sell and short signal on $ goog and $ googl stock ? URL google investor"". So the target is Google, specifically股票代码GOTU or something similar. But maybe the exact code isn't crucial here since I'm focusing on positive or negative impact.

Now, analyzing each tweet one by one:

1. ""rt AT_USER google alphabet a sell and short signal on $ goog and $ googl stock ? URL google investor"". This seems to be a query suggesting that Google has a new signal about their stock. It mentions selling and shorting signals, which could indicate some concern or worry about the stock's future performance.

2. ""xly consumer discretionary select sector spdr eod data URL $ xly $ dia $ goog $ uwti xly stockmarket investing"". This tweet is discussing sector-specific stocks, specifically XLY (Xtra Latitude) and UWTI (University of Washington TriStar Energy). The mention of stock market investing makes me think about how investors are looking at specific sectors. If the sentiment around these stocks is positive, it might influence investor decisions.

3. ""google alphabet a sell and short signal on $ goog and $ googl stock ? URL google investor URL"". Similar to tweet 1, this seems to be a query about Google's signals regarding their stocks. It could indicate investors are either bearish or bullish on the company.

4. ""rt AT_USER optimism surrounding new holding company alphabet has google stock soaring . trade $ goog now ! get $ 25 free to start ! htt …"". This tweet is very positive, stating that there's a lot of optimism about Google's performance and offering a deal. It suggests that investors are excited or optimistic about the stock.

5. ""rt AT_USER $ goog : us four knowns and four unknowns in google's alphabet soup google inc URL sp500"". This tweet is discussing the context of Google's presence on the S&P 500, mentioning four knowns and four unknowns. It might be indicating a general overview or analysis related to Google's stock performance.

6. ""sgyp synergy pharmaceuticals , inc . investor opinions URL $ sgyp $ fxe $ bib $ goog sgyp stocks invest"". This tweet is about drug companies and their investors' thoughts. It could imply that the company is looking at specific sectors or product lines, which might affect the overall market sentiment.

7. ""rt AT_USER here's a great visual . how google's new company , alphabet , is structured : URL $ goog $ googl URL"". This tweet provides a visual explanation of Google's new company structure but doesn't express any positive or negative sentiment. It seems more like an informative tweet rather than affecting investor sentiment.

Now, summarizing the factors from each tweet:

1. Query about signals for Google stock.
2. Mentioning sector-specific stocks.
3. Another query about Google's signals.
4. Positive statement about Google stock.
5. Context on S&P 500 with four knowns and unknowns.
6. Discussion on drug companies' investor opinions.
7. Informative tweet on company structure without sentiment.

Overall, tweets 1, 3, and 4 are more direct and specific to the stock, while tweets 2 and 6 discuss broader sector or industry aspects. Tweets 5 provides context but doesn't express a clear positive or negative opinion. 

Considering that some tweets are direct queries (1,3) which could indicate investor interest or concern, but other tweets are more about market overview (5). Additionally, tweet 4 explicitly states that Google stock is soaring and offers deals, which suggests optimism.

In such scenarios, a mix of positive statements from direct tweets can create a strong positive sentiment. Therefore, despite some uncertainty in the broader context, the positive tweet on Google's performance leans towards a positive overall impact."
2015-08-14,Positive,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether these tweets will positively, neutrally, or negatively impact the stock price of a company. Let me break down each tweet and see what they're suggesting.

First tweet: ""delaware corporate law makes google restructuring possible $ goog URL"". Hmm, this seems like a news story about Google restructuring. I know that Google has had restructuring issues before, but this is more positive because it's talking about future restructuring possibilities in the US. That's usually seen as good news for investors because it might reduce their financial obligations or improve their structure.

Second tweet: ""huge moves on our penny stock picks lately ! big new pick tomorrow : URL $ erbb $ bbda $ goog"". I'm not exactly sure what pennies are being referred to here. Penny stocks typically have lower valuation multiples, like $20 a share or something similar. But the tweets mention big moves on their picks and they're expecting some major moves on their penny stocks, including a new pick for tomorrow. This looks like positive news because it's showing potential gains from selected stocks.

Now, putting these together: The first tweet is about Google restructuring, which can be seen as a good thing if it's making things easier for investors. The second tweet is talking about penny stocks with big moves, implying that the company is taking action to boost their valuations. Both are positive indicators of good news affecting the stock price.

I'm not sure how these factors tie into each other or if there's any conflict between them. But since both tweets are highlighting favorable developments for the company, they should probably be considered collectively as positive impacts on the stock."
2015-08-15,Missing,File not found
2015-08-16,Missing,File not found
2015-08-17,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price of Apple Inc. Let's start by identifying each tweet and analyzing its impact.

First tweet: ""Our penny stock alerts gained over 550 % in 5 weeks ! see see how to get our new picks early : URL $ ibm $ goog $ aapl"". Hmm, this seems like a positive message about gains. It mentions a significant increase in their penny stock and encourages looking for new picks, which could boost investor confidence. That sounds positive.

Second tweet: ""my latest going over top funds ' activity in q2 2015 : URL $ spx $ ibm $ wmt $ pgnx $ baba $ amzn $ goog URL"". This mentions a large fund's activity and some tech stocks. While it's positive, the context is about investing in tech companies, which might not directly relate to Apple unless there are related funds. So maybe a bit of positive sentiment here.

Third tweet: ""i'm an android guy telling you AT_USER is crushing spotify , pandora , & the pathetic google music in discovery .. $ aapl $ p $ goog"". The user is talking about Android developers on platforms and Google Music, which could be a positive note. It's more promotional but not directly related to Apple's performance.

Fourth tweet: ""3 apple inc .suppliers that have benefitted from the iphone 6 launch : [ at motley fool ] - ... URL $ aapl $ goog $ pcln $ k"". This mentions suppliers of Apple products, which is great because if their products are popular, it can boost demand for Apple's stock. That sounds positive.

Fifth tweet: ""rt amigobulls : $ amzn $ fb $ fb $ goog $ googl google spins off niantic labs following alphabet announcement . … URL"". Amigoo bulls seem positive about Amariq.com and Facebook and Google. If Amariq is a tech company, this could be a boost to their stock. It's a bit of a niche topic but can have short-term positive effects.

Now, putting it all together: The first tweet has strong positives, the third mentions Android developers (which might indicate interest in Apple), the fourth ties suppliers (indicative of good demand), and the fifth talks about Amariq which could be tech-related. So overall, most tweets are encouraging, no big negatives or concerns."
2015-08-18,Neutral,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a given company. The user has provided 10 tweets, and each seems to be related to different aspects like sales trends, new company structures, hft actions, etc.

First, I need to extract the target stock from each tweet. Looking through them, it seems like the main companies involved are Google (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Facebook (FB). But wait, some tweets mention other companies too, but they're probably contexting around those four or a few others.

Next, I need to analyze each tweet's factors. Positive factors are things that might boost the stock, while negative factors could either support or hinder it. For example, in tweet 3, ""rt AT_USER how google's new company , alphabet , is structured"" seems like a positive point because it suggests Google is building something new.

Then, I have to assess each tweet's sentiment towards investor confidence or expectations. The user mentioned things like ""declining sales for苹果"" which would likely be negative. But if the sales are continuing and they're in 2015, that might indicate uncertainty or lack of progress.

After evaluating each tweet, I'll summarize the overall trend. For instance, multiple mentions of Google's positive projects could mean a strong positive signal. Apple's continued sales issues and other factors like Tesla breaking into screens might create mixed sentiment.

I also need to consider how these tweets relate to the target stock. If they're talking about Google's future plans or hightech companies, that adds more context around the company's potential in the market.

So, putting it all together, I'll tally up the positive and negative points. Positive tweets might include projects like solar panels or new products, while negatives could involve declining sales or other factors suggesting instability. The overall sentiment is then determined by combining these assessments."
2015-08-19,Negative,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for the given company. The user provided a list of 12 tweets with specific factors and actions mentioned in each. My task is to go through each tweet one by one, assess positive or negative factors, evaluate the sentiment based on those factors, and then come up with an overall sentiment summary.

First, I need to identify the target stock for each tweet. The target stock isn't explicitly given in the provided tweets, but from the context, it seems like the user is referring to a specific company whose stock price they want to analyze. However, without knowing which stock, I might have to make some assumptions or perhaps focus on trends related to Google's performance since several of these tweets mention Google.

Let me go through each tweet systematically:

1. ""Our platinum members saw stock picks gin over 550 % in 5 weeks ! see our exclusive new pick : URL $ ibm $ goog $ aapl"" – This seems unrelated unless it's about Bitcoin (ibm), Google, or Apple. I'm unsure of the exact target stock here.
2. ""Google to launch youtube production studio in mumbai URL … $ googl $ google big URL"" – Again, this is about Google's future projects without specifying a particular stock.
3. ""Google went public 11 years ago today . post-ipo , its trailing 12 - month revenues rose from $ 3b to $ 70b . $ goog $ googl URL"" – This mentions Google's IPO, revenue growth, and other metrics but doesn't specify the target stock.
4. ""Our platinum members saw stock picks gin over 550 % in 5 weeks ! see our exclusive new pick : URL $ cbl $ goog $ bll"" – Similar to tweet 1, this could be about Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency.
5. ""Supertrades could buy a freakin house with this recent win ! ! $ mbly $ aapl $ jcp $ tasr $ goog"" – This mentions Supertrades and Google, possibly related to the company's products or investments.
6. ""Massive new penny stock pick coming out soon ! see it early : URL $ ibm $ goog $ aapl"" – Another combination of stocks, maybe Bitcoin, Apple, and Amazon.
7. ""$ goog URL the self-driving tesla model s : autopilot and ' summoning ' in focus URL"" – This clearly mentions Google's AI development but doesn't specify the stock.
8. ""$ goog in the right side of the market"" – This is about Google's position relative to other stocks, possibly related to a specific sector or index.
9. ""Meet onhub : google's new wi-fi router URL $ goog $ googl"" – Mentioning Google's tech products but again, not specifying the target stock.
10. ""$ fb $ c $ goog $ aapl the great regurgitation - update from option millionaires - stock options chatroom there's a si ... URL"" – Again, multiple stocks involved, possibly related to Facebook and Apple.
11. ""rt $ nflx hft algos broke 123.30 in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 10:02 , p / t 135.00 $ bidu $ gpro $ amzn $ fb $ goog $ tsla $ aapl $ qqq quant"" – This tweet mentions multiple tech companies, including Tesla and Quantum. It might be related to Google's investments in these companies.
12. ""$ goog inc ( googl ) ' s project ara looks like a downright dud $ googl $ google project ara URL URL"" – This is a statement about a specific project by Google but doesn't specify the stock.

From all of this, I can see that many tweets are discussing Google's upcoming projects, products, and future strategic moves. The words ""Google,"" ""AI development,"" and ""investments"" are consistent across multiple tweets, which suggests Google is a significant player in the market. Additionally, the mention of Tesla (tesla) in tweet 11 indicates a potential investment opportunity.

Now, looking at each tweet:

- Tweets 5,6,7,8,9,10,11, and 12 are all about Google's future products or projects.
- Tweet 3 talks about a prior IPO of Google but doesn't specify the target stock.
- Tweets 4,11 mention Bitcoin (ibm), which is a major cryptocurrency.

The overall sentiment seems to be positive because several tweets highlight potential future successes for Google. The lack of specific target stocks might make it hard to pin down an exact stock price impact, but given that Google is involved in multiple tech companies and projects, the positive outlook is likely expected."
2015-08-20,Negative,"Alright, so I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at each tweet individually to identify positive or negative factors. The first thing is to extract any relevant stock symbols from the tweets. I notice that some tweets mention ""goog"" as part of them. So, maybe the stock in question here is Google?

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. Positive factors might include mentions of successful target hits or upgrades on their financial performance. For example, tweet 1 says GARTLEY REACHes targets 1 and 2, which could be a positive sign about their growth. Similarly, if Google's stock is getting overvalued, that would add to the positive.

Negative factors might include things like predicting something major will cause issues for investors or causing confusion in markets. For example, tweet 2 talks about Google rigging the 2016 election, which could be seen as a negative event affecting investor sentiment.

Then, I have to assess the sentiment of each tweet. This involves looking at whether the tweets are talking positively, negatively, or neutrally about the stock. If multiple positive tweets and fewer negatives are present, it's likely a positive overall effect on the stock price. Conversely, if there's an imbalance between positives and negatives, it could be neutral. If too many negative tweets are influencing opinions, it might be negative.

Looking at the specific trends:
1. GARTLEY REACHing targets 1 and 2 is definitely positive for them.
2. Google rigging the 2016 election raises concerns about their reputation.
3. The mention of a heat map affecting index components suggests uncertainty or volatility.
4. Multiple stock symbols in each tweet indicate that the analysis covers a broader range, possibly multiple stocks.

Now, considering sentiment:
- Positive tweets: GARTLEY REACHing targets 1 and 2 is a strong positive.
- Negative tweets: The rigging of the election is significant and negative, while the heat map suggests market uncertainty which could be negative.

There are some neutrals as well. For example, Google ceo selling $22,450 in stock, which might indicate a sell-order or buy-initiative from other sources, adding to negative sentiment on Google's price.

But looking at the overall impact: while there are several positive mentions, the rigging event is a clear negative. The heat map and multiple factors also contribute to uncertainty. So even though some tweets are positive, the negative events dominate.

Putting it all together, the negative events like Google's election rigging and market uncertainty outweigh the positives. Therefore, the overall sentiment is likely Negative."
2015-08-21,Negative,"Alright, let's break down how I approached analyzing these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of Google. 

First, I identified the target stock symbol from each tweet as ""goog"". For each tweet, my goal was to separate them into positive and negative factors. Positive factors usually indicate potential benefits for the company, while negatives might suggest risks or challenges.

Starting with the first tweet: ""report : google testing video ads within search results URL $ goog $ googl URL"". The user is testing Google's video ads in their search results URL. This could be a strategic move to improve engagement and reach potential customers, which would likely be positive for the stock price as it suggests growth opportunities.

The second tweet mentions AT_USER setting life sciences team free within alphabet URL. Alphabet is known in tech circles, so this might indicate a competitive advantage by offering free resources to the life sciences division. This could either help maintain or enhance their position in the market and possibly increase profits, which would be positive.

The third tweet starts with ""rt AT_USER qualcomm reportedly..."" It sounds like Google is talking about Qualcom entering the consumer drone market. Drone tech companies are growing rapidly, so this might indicate a shift in revenue streams or product offerings, potentially boosting the stock price.

Looking at tweets 4 and 5: The first one says $ goog at 666.66, which seems like a specific price point. Without context, it's hard to assess whether it's an overvaluation or undervaluation. It could either indicate that the stock is on a certain level but not necessarily trending upwards or downwards.

The second tweet suggests that the re-structuring led to overvaluation because of the drone market entry. If Google's restructuring was done in a way that improved their business model, this might have been seen as positive news, leading people to think they were undervalued and thus buy more shares.

Putting it all together: The first tweet is strategic, the second shows potential for growth, the third shifts revenue streams, and the last two are about stock price levels. While the first three could contribute positively or moderately, the fourth might be a specific event affecting investor sentiment directly. Without knowing if $ goog is above or below its previous level, it's hard to tell if this tweet is positive or negative. The third tweet is significant as it opens up new markets, which can increase demand and possibly drive stock price.

So overall, I think the sentiment is mixed but leans towards neutral because while there are some positive factors like strategic testing and expanding into drone tech, the specific price point on tweet 4 doesn't give a clear indication of trend. The third tweet suggests potential expansion but if it's just an update without any new info, maybe not too much impact."
2015-08-22,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. So, the user has given me some tweets and wants me to analyze their impact on a stock's future price by classifying them as Positive, Neutral, or Negative. Hmm, okay. 

First, I need to understand what each tweet is about. Looking at the first tweet: ""google blurs topless woman's face — but not her breasts — in street … URL google $ goog $ googl … URL."" Okay, so it seems like there are some links and mentions of Google. The mention of a person with their face blurred is a bit unclear—maybe referring to an event or something? It could be about a story or news related to Google's performance.

Since the tweet ends with ""URL google $ goog $ googl … URL,"" that might indicate a link to some information, possibly from Google Finance. If I assume this tweet is promoting a stock named 'goog,' then it's related to Google. But wait, the user mentioned the target stock symbol. In the initial instructions, they said to extract the stock symbol from the tweets. However, none of the provided tweets mention any stocks except for ' goog ' which might not be a standard symbol.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. The user's first tweet says ""google blurs topless woman's face — but not her breasts — in street … URL google $ goog $ googl … URL."" That could be an attempt to link to Google Finance or some financial data. If the target stock is 'goog,' then yes, it refers to Google, but I'm not sure if that's correct because sometimes 'goog' isn't the standard symbol.

Assuming it's about Google, let me proceed. The first tweet mentions a Google logo on women's clothing, which might be in reference to a story or profile of Google. However, without more context, it's hard to tell exactly what's going on. It could be positive if referring to brand exposure or negative if something negative is mentioned.

Looking at the output requirement, I need to conclude with one line saying [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. So, if this tweet is promoting Google stock, whether it's positive or not depends on the content inside. Since it mentions a woman's face being blurred, which could imply that the company has had some success or something in that area, maybe it's positive.

But without more context about what ""topless woman's face"" refers to—like if it's from a story where Google was mentioned—the sentiment might be uncertain. It could go either way.

Wait, another thought: sometimes links like this are used to load content into the browser for analytics or quick insights. But in terms of stock analysis, unless they link to a stock price or financial news, which doesn't seem to be the case here. So maybe it's not about a particular company but just general Google-related stuff.

In that case, without knowing what specific part of Google is being mentioned, it's hard to assess the sentiment towards the stock. If it's positive because of brand recognition or success stories, then it might be positive. But if there's no direct mention of the stock, like ""GOOG"" in quotes, perhaps neutral.

But wait, looking back at the output requirement, I have to conclude based on the analysis. So since the tweet doesn't specify the target stock symbol, but from ""google $ goog $ googl,"" maybe it's referring to Google, so 'goog' as a stock symbol? That might be problematic because sometimes companies change their symbols when they go public or something.

Alternatively, if I'm supposed to take the stock symbol as given, perhaps 'GOOG' is the actual stock. But in the tweets, it's ""google $ goog $ googl,"" so maybe that's a typo and should be 'GOOG,' but not sure. Either way, without knowing what exactly is being mentioned about Google, I can't be certain whether it's positive or negative.

I think the best approach here is to consider that this tweet might not provide enough information for stock analysis because it could refer to a general aspect of Google without linking it directly to a specific stock. Therefore, the impact on the stock price might be considered neutral since there's no direct link or clear sentiment expressed towards the stock.

So, given all that, I'll conclude with [Neutral] as the overall sentiment for this tweet."
2015-08-23,Neutral,"Alright, so I need to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price for the given company. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually.

The first tweet says ""rt AT_USER cash holdings ($ billions) – apple $ aapl : $203b.microsoft $ msft : $108b google $ goog : $70b twitter $ twtr market cap: $17..."". Hmm, AT_USER is mentioned here. I'm not sure what that stands for, but it seems like they're talking about cash holdings in Apple. Cash holdings usually mean the company holds a lot of cash or shares. If Apple has a high amount of cash, it might indicate financial stability and can sometimes lead to stronger stock prices. But I'm not certain if this alone is enough.

Looking at the next tweet: ""$ goog URL world's biggest oil companies - 2015 URL"". This looks like a reference to Google's stock performance in 2015 regarding the U.S. energy market. It mentions Google's stock on that year, which would give some historical context about its valuation compared to other big tech companies like Apple and Microsoft. If the company had strong performance during tough times, it might boost their stock price in the long run.

Third tweet: ""$ fb $ c $ goog $ aapl where will the spy close contest follow-up and re-run URL"". Here, ""sp Py"" stands for the S&P 500 (SPY), which is an index of 500 large companies. The mention of a contest or follow-up seems a bit odd. It might be a typo or another way of saying something else. I'm not sure what this tweet is about, so it's hard to assess.

The fourth tweet: ""stay ahead with nasdaq 100 news, views & analysis $ msft $ aapl $ goog URL URL"". Again, ""sp Py"" appears here, referring back to the S&P 500. This seems to be updating on how the Nasdaq 100 is performing compared to Apple and Microsoft. If these companies are doing well in the broader market, it could indicate their fundamentals.

Putting it all together, while the first tweet mentions a significant amount of cash holdings, which might imply confidence or stability, the other tweets provide context about past performance (2015 for Google) and future trends ( NASDAQ 100). These are both positive indicators. So overall, combining these factors suggests that the stock is likely performing well in the long run."
2015-08-24,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of an airline company. Let's start by breaking down each tweet and evaluating them one by one.

First, the user mentions that I should identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking through the provided tweets, none of them directly provide a specific stock name. Hmm, maybe it's implied or there might be multiple stocks involved? I'll have to make an educated guess here. Perhaps ""mbly"" is associated with the airline in question.

Next, each tweet needs to be analyzed for positive and negative factors. Let me go through them step by step.

1. The first tweet has a lot of dollar signs and symbols, so it might be referring to multiple stocks: $ aapl $ amba $ amzn $ etc. I'll need to assess the sentiment of each individual stock here, but since they're all part of the same stock symbol cluster (APL), maybe they influence investor sentiment overall.

2. The second tweet also lists several stock symbols. It mentions trends on the nasdaq 100 and some specific stocks like pcln, googl, atvi, etc. This could indicate broader market trends affecting the sector or individual stocks.

3. The third tweet is positive: ""mmmmh , i should consider a $ goog buy today..."" Here, ""goog"" is likely referencing Google, but in this context, it might be referring to Google's stock. The phrasing suggests excitement about buying shares of Google, which could indicate investor sentiment towards the company.

4. The fourth tweet mentions ""classic big win by AT_USER $ mbly $ aapl $ jcp $ tasr $ goog"" and others like ""ebay"". It seems like someone is making a claim that there's been a successful transaction related to these stocks, implying that the stock performance is positive.

Now, combining all these factors. The third tweet directly mentions Google with an excitement call, which could mean a strong buy intent. The fourth tweet also points towards Google being involved in a transaction, reinforcing investor confidence. The other tweets are about broader market trends and specific company names like Apple (APL), Amazon (AMZN), and others.

Considering the overall sentiment from all these tweets, it seems to be positive. Investors seem excited about buying stocks related to these companies, especially Google. There's some talk of a nasdaq 100 trend, which could indicate that the market is watching their performance. However, without specific data on how each tweet affects individual stock prices versus overall trends, it's challenging to pin down exactly.

But given the phrasing and the direct mention of Google in multiple tweets, I think the positive sentiment is likely the strongest here."
2015-08-25,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a given company. Let me break down each tweet step by step.

First, the target stock is not specified in this case, so I'll assume it's something like ""Barclays Tips"" based on the output tags provided. The user mentioned using [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative] as possible outputs.

Let's look at each tweet:

1. ""after 3,000 % gains in the past year , we have a major new pick out ! big update : URL $ cbl $ goog $ bll"" - This seems to be a promotional tweet with no negative information and some positive elements. It mentions gains, a new pick, and investments. Positive.

2. ""sso proshares ultra s & p 500 fund short sales URL $ sso $ goog $ aapl $ bbd / b.to sso stock sharesune sunedison , inc . …"" - This looks like it's about short sales or related trading activities. It mentions short sales on the S&P 500, which could indicate a strategy to reduce risk. However, without context on how this affects the company, it's hard to say if it's positive or negative.

3. ""rt AT_USER stood pat today . was prepared cause of 'making money' . picked up $ fb , added $ nflx , $ goog . and $ scty . enjoy you …"" - This tweet is more about action-oriented topics related to investing, like picking stocks. It's promotional and seems positive.

4. ""ad blocking on safari could lead to apple losing billions in easy money URL $ googl $ goog $ aapl"" - This clearly mentions Apple's stock with a direct link. Adblocking can have negative impacts on companies because ads can drive revenue. So this tweet is indicative of negative sentiment towards the company.

5. ""tvix twitter , inc . ask URL $ tvix $ wfm $ goog $ ung tvix stockmarket stocks"" - This looks like an email or social media post from Twitter with a link to their stocks. It's neutral because it doesn't state any clear positive or negative actions.

6. ""tip ishares barclays tips bond fund open URL $ tip $ goog $ aria $ mpel tip finance nasdaq"" - Similar to tweet 4, mentions Apple stock and adblocking. Negative sentiment again from the same reasoning.

Now, combining all these tweets:

- Positive tweets: Tweets 1, 3, 5.
- Negative tweets: Tweets 2, 4, 6.
  
Tweets 2 and 6 are about short sales or ad blocking strategies. This could either lead to increased revenue (positive) or decreased investor sentiment (negative). However, without more context on the specific actions taken by the company, it's hard to determine the exact impact.

But looking at tweet 4 specifically, it clearly states that ad blocking on Safari could lead to Apple losing billions in easy money. This is a direct statement of concern about the company's financial performance. It shows explicit negative information, which likely has a significant negative impact on investor sentiment.

Therefore, despite other positive tweets, the presence of this tweet suggests overall negative sentiment towards the stock."
2015-08-26,Positive,"Okay, let me figure out how to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of the given company. The stock in question is Apple Inc. (AAPL). 

First, I'll look at each tweet individually and break them down into factors like positive and negative, then assess the sentiment.

1. The first tweet mentions Google's class C filings. This could indicate financial health, but without more context, it's hard to tell if it affects Apple. So, maybe neutral.
2. The second tweet talks about a stock price update on Wednesday, August 26th, 2015. That seems like an old date and not related to current events, so probably neutral.
3. The third tweet is about Google receiving a new alert for self-driving cars. This could lead to more investor interest or concern about regulatory issues, which might be positive if it's good news for Apple. But I'm not sure; maybe partial.
4. The fourth tweet refers to AT_USER mentioning Google's ""chrome"" wheels. That seems unrelated, so probably negative.
5. The fifth tweet discusses Microsoft's Cortana as a better alternative to Google's self-driving car. Microsoft is a competitor of Apple, and if their product is seen as a good substitute, it might boost demand for Apple stock. So, positive.
6. The sixth tweet upgrades Goldman Sachs' Google stock and adds it to their conviction list. Upgrades usually mean investors are optimistic, which could be positive news for Apple's stock. Positive.
7. The seventh tweet talks about Amazon's products and Apple's future plans. If there's a potential shift in trends, like more demand for Apple tech from Amazon, this could be positive. Positive.
8. The eighth tweet mentions high demand for the Apple Watch, which is a competitor but not directly related to Apple. This might not have a direct impact on the stock. Neutral.
9. The ninth tweet involves Xly stock under a SPDR S&P 500 index ETF (XLY). This could be positive if it's expected to rise in value. Positive.
10. The tenth tweet discusses competitors selling products priced in yuan and suppliers receiving dollars. This could affect sales, but again, not directly related to Apple. Neutral.

Now, combining these: Positive tweets are 3,5,7,9; Negative are 4,8; Neutral is 2,6,10. That's mostly positive, with a few negatives. So overall sentiment leans towards positive."
2015-08-27,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. The user wants me to determine if each tweet is positive, neutral, or negative and then conclude with the overall sentiment. Let's go through each tweet one by one.

First, the target stock isn't given, but I can figure it out from the context. Looking at some tweets: ""we sent a secret new penny stock pick"" mentions GPS and NSPR stocks. Another says ""investors sell shares of google on strength after insider selling"". So maybe the company is Coeur D'Alene Mines Corp? That sounds like a mining company, which can be negative because mines can cause financial issues.

Now, analyzing each tweet:

1. ""rt AT_USER $ sequx investor day transcript $ vrx $ goog $ googl $ pcp $ ma $ brk . a $ brk . b $ orly $ fast $ tjx $ idxx URL URL"": This seems like a random link without specific sentiment, so maybe neutral.

2. ""we sent a secret new penny stock pick to our platinum members ! get exclusive special access : URL $ gps $ nspr $ goog"" – mentions GPS and NSPR stocks which are mines, negative.

3. ""csco cisco systems , inc . ex-div date URL $ csco $ nugt $ goog $ abgb csco stock stocks"": Talks about a company's ex-dividend date, not sure if that affects stock price directly.

4. ""cde coeur d alene mines corp . exchange URL $ cde $ kgc $ exel $ goog cde tradeideas stocks"" – CDE is Coeur D'Alene Mines, which we saw earlier is negative.

5. ""$ mcd $ goog : android pay release date on august 26 ? mcdonald ’ s leaks … : URL"": Talks about Android app and McDonald's leaks, no immediate impact on stock.

6. ""investors sell shares of google on strength after insider selling $ goog URL"": Positive because investors are selling, which might be a sign of positive sentiment if others follow, but it's unclear without more info.

7. ""tencent : o canada ! URL $ aapl apple $ baba $ bce $ bidu $ chl $ fb $ goog $ pypl $ rci $ t $ v $ vz $ ma $ tcehy $ googl"" – Multiple tech companies, but no specific stock mentioned with clear impact.

8. ""$ goog - google rebuffs European union on antitrust charges - - update URL"": The company is Google, and they're rebuffing EU antitrust for their actions, which could be negative as it might affect stock prices.

9. ""gpre green plains renewable energy inc . filings URL $ gpre $ goog $ ashr $ dis gpre stockmarket stockmarketgpro …"" – Not sure about the impact of this filing. It mentions GPre's stock market issues; not clear.

10. ""jim 5011 : goog google inc . - class c investor opinions URL $ goog $ uvxy $ celg $ cure goog fin … URL"": Says investors are holding views on Google, which could indicate a positive sentiment if others follow.

Putting it all together: The tweets mention mines, negative impact on a mining company. There's some sell pressure but not clear about everyone else following. So overall sentiment is probably [Neutral]."
2015-08-28,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on stock prices. I have two tweets here, so I'll take them one by one.

First tweet: ""$ goog - google rebuffs European union on antitrust charges - - 2nd update URL"". Hmm, ""rebufs"" means to reaffirm or counter. So Google is responding to EU's antitrust charges. I know that Google has been involved in antitrust issues before, and their reactions can influence investor sentiment. If they're being called out for these charges, it could either improve or hurt their financial position.

Second tweet: ""rt aidotech : 😎 💬 ai deeplearning machinelearning 💻 🌇 6 machine learning giants to watch $ amzn $ fb $ goog $ ibm $ msf … URL"". This one is more positive. It's talking about AI and machine learning, specifically mentioning companies like Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft. I remember that tech companies are generally seen as strong players in the market, so investing in them would be a good move.

Now, for each tweet, I need to identify Positive and Negative factors. The first tweet is negative because Google's response could lead to increased scrutiny and possibly more investment from other companies, which might either improve or hurt their stock. But I think the negative side here is that it's being rebuffed, so maybe investors are worried about future performance.

The second tweet is positive because AI and machine learning are booming fields, with many companies looking to invest in them. This could lead to increased demand for tech stocks like Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft. So this could positively impact the stock price by boosting confidence among investors.

Looking at overall sentiment, both factors seem to support a positive outcome. The second tweet is driving more investment in tech companies, which can increase demand and thus the stock price. Even though the first tweet might have some negative implications, the second one's strong push for AI seems like a solid positive trend."
2015-08-29,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the future stock price of a given company based on their content. The user provided a list of tweets and wants me to analyze them into positive, neutral, or negative impacts.

First, let's take each tweet one by one. 

1. ""iphone 6s prices leak as new camera revealed : $ aapl $ goog $ pcln $ k"" - This seems like it's giving information about the company, specifically Apple (A.P.S.LN) and Google (TWO.N), which are both major tech companies. The mention of an iPhone price leak suggests that someone is updating their stock data or making it public, which could indicate investor interest or analysis.

2. ""aa alcoa , inc . change URL $ aa $ goog $ ctlt $ tso aa invest investingaapl apple , inc . day low …"" - This tweet mentions Alcoa (AL), another big company in the energy sector. The mention of a decrease in price and the use of words like 'investing' could imply that there's some sentiment about the stock, maybe fear or uncertainty due to market conditions.

3. ""cjtf gold & silver mining of nevada inc . quotes URL $ cjtf $ twtr $ goog $ ewj cjtf stock tradeideas"" - This tweet is related to gold and silver mining in Nevada, which is a precious metals company. It's showing that the company posts financials, possibly indicating some news about their operations or market sentiment.

4. ""buy tesla $ tsla dips b4 the $ googl $ goog alphabet or apple $ aapl acquire URL … URL"" - This looks like an advertisement promoting Tesla (TE), specifically suggesting they are acquiring companies from Alphabet (GOOGL) and Apple (APL). Acquisitions can often signal strategic moves, but this might not have a direct impact on stock price unless it's related to fundamentals.

5. ""eld.to eldorado gold corp . short sales URL $ eld.to $ cop $ goog $ tmf eld.to invest stock"" - This is about gold and short selling. Short selling can be seen as risk management, but without specific context, it might just be a normal activity in the financial markets.

6. ""uvxy proshares ultra vix short-term futures etf financials URL $ uvxy $ goog $ xlf $ gld"" - Proshares (PN) is involved in trading financial futures, which affects stock prices of their clients. The mention of VIX and financials suggests investors are concerned about market volatility or economic data.

7. ""tickers trending on twtr in last 1 hour $ aapl $ fosl $ goog $ je greece + debt URL URL"" - This is from Twra (TW) which is part of the Russell 2000 index. Mentioning competitors like Facebook, Microsoft, and Greece's debt could indicate investor sentiment about their performance or financial stability.

8. ""xlu utilities select sector spdr bid size URL $ xlu $ goog $ amzn $ giii xlu pennystocks stock"" - XLU (PX) is part of the S&P 500 index. The mention of utility companies could indicate overall market sentiment, but without specifics, it's hard to say if it's positive or negative.

9. ""avxl anavex life sciences corp . company info URL $ avxl $ xcra $ goog $ corn avxl stockmarket stockmarketaxp ..."" - Anavex (AN) is a life sciences company, so this tweet could be about their financials, which might affect their stock price positively or negatively based on their business performance.

Putting it all together: Each tweet relates to different companies and topics like tech, utilities, precious metals, financials. They either provide information, suggest actions (acquisitions), indicate investor sentiment, or discuss market trends. Without more context about the current company being analyzed, it's challenging to assess if these actions are good, bad, or neutral for their stock price."
2015-08-30,Positive,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided several tweets and wants me to analyze their impact on a company's stock price by determining if it's positive, neutral, or negative. 

First, I need to figure out the target stock from each tweet. But looking at the tweets, they don't have any stock symbols. That might be a problem because I can't extract the stock symbol directly. Hmm, maybe the user intended for me to infer the stock based on the context? Let's see.

For example, in tweet 1, it mentions "" goog $ googl "", which suggests Google Inc. as the target stock. Similarly, other tweets like "" google shares still have 20 % upside URL "" could indicate that Google is a key player here. But since I don't have the actual symbols, I might have to make an educated guess or assume the most common companies mentioned are the targets.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one. 

1. The first tweet talks about oil services and the stock price. It mentions "" goog $ googl "" which points towards Google. I know Google is a major player in tech, so this could be positive for investors buying into tech stocks.
2. Tweet 2 discusses antitrust charges against Google Inc., affecting its financials. Negative sentiment because it's about legal issues that can hurt the company.
3.Tweet 3 mentions investing and fund performances like P/E ratio. Positive, as a lower P/E often indicates good valuation.
4. Tweet 4 talks about a viral video on iAcu's YouTube channel. While engaging with content, it doesn't mention stock performance or company news, so less information but perhaps positive indirectly.
5. Tweet 5 is about food trade ideas and investments in tech. Positive because investing in areas of interest can boost stock prices.
6. Tweet 6 says Google shares have an upside, which reinforces a positive outlook, likely for the stock price.
7. Tweet 7 suggests retirement funds and mentions iAcu again, but again, no specific company identified.
8. Tweet 8 is about class B shares in Google Inc., which are preferred by many investors, so that's positive.

Putting it all together, each tweet has some positive factors like tech growth, investment in successful companies, and a strong stock performance. The negative factor is the antitrust lawsuit against Google Inc. However, since there are multiple positive tweets, they might outweigh the single negative point. 

Therefore, considering the majority of positive information and one moderate negative note, I think the overall sentiment leans towards [Positive]."
2015-08-31,Positive,"Alright, let's break down how I approached analyzing these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of Google.

First, I started by identifying the target stock symbol from each tweet. I noticed that some tweets mention ""goog"" repeatedly, which is the ticker symbol for Google Inc., so I focused on those.

For each relevant tweet, I separated them into Positive and Negative factors. Positive might include mentions of success stories or strategic growth initiatives. Negatives could be any negative remarks about competitors or other companies that directly relate to Google's operations.

Next, I evaluated the sentiment of each tweet using a 5-point scale (1-5) where 1 is very negative and 5 is very positive. The more strong statements I saw were ""gug"" which likely indicated positive factors like strategic growth. However, some tweets had direct negatives about competitors or their impact on Google's operations.

I then combined these assessments to determine the overall sentiment. In this case, several tweets highlighted Google's success and strategic moves without any negative remarks, which made me lean towards a Positive overall sentiment."
2015-09-01,Neutral,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about Google's stock price impact. I'm not too familiar with all of them, but I'll go through each one step by step.

First tweet: ""hey , readers ! what do you think of google's new logo ? let us know here : URL $ goog URL"" It just mentions a new logo and doesn't provide any information about the stock. Maybe it's just personal commentary without a clear impact on price.

Second tweet: ""rt google steps up its fight against diabetes URL medtech meddevice $ goog $ sny $ dxcm"". This seems like an investment proposition suggesting Google is going after diabetes, which could boost their stock.

Third tweet: "" $ goog $ spy $ qqq $ ma september 1st , 2015 watch list - update from option millionaires - stock options chatroom mark ... URL"" It looks like Google's logo was updated on September 1st. While that might be a personal update, it's more about their brand image rather than a direct stock move.

Fourth tweet: ""AT_USER how does $ goog partnership with $ sny affect $ mnkd ? "" They're asking if the partnership between Google and Sny affects their product (mnkd). This could have sentiment implications based on whether this is seen as a good or bad partnership for Google's product strategy.

Fifth tweet: ""rt AT_USER just in : google announces new corporate logo that is a "" reflection of all the ways google works "" • $ goog URL"" They're reporting about Google changing their corporate logo, which might be seen positively if it reflects how they work or negatively if it affects their brand image elsewhere.

Sixth tweet: ""$ goog active , relative volume : 6.53 , 1h , 7:00 pm , nasdaq $ ndx $ spy"". Relative volume of 6.53 in the Nasdaq, but I'm not sure what that means in terms of stock activity.

Seventh tweet: ""AT_USER $ goog ask price $ 606.75 right now . may go lower ..."" They're stating the current ask price and predicting a possible decrease. If Google's stock is expected to drop, it could be a negative impact on their stock price.

Eighth tweet: ""$ aapl $ goog $ pcln $ k"". This mentions Apple collaborating with Hollywood execs about exclusive content, which could have positive implications for both companies' stock prices. More collaboration can boost earnings and stock performance.

Ninth tweet: "" $ goog : whether google inc ( nasdaq : goog ) is abusing its internet … : URL"" They're questioning Google's internet use practices. If they believe they are abusing their brand, it might lower investor confidence and have a negative impact on the stock price.

Now, putting this together. The main positive points seem to be Apple's collaboration and Google's partnership for diabetes. However, there are some personal updates about Google's logo and current stock price expectations. While some tweets do suggest potential stock movements, many don't provide enough direct information about Google's actual financial performance or market position.

It's a mix of informed speculation (like the ask price prediction) and positive announcements (Apple content collaboration). But without concrete data on revenue, profit margins, or other metrics, it's hard to determine a clear overall sentiment. However, the expected stock price increase for Google could indicate optimism, but the lack of direct information might make the conclusion uncertain.

Considering all these factors, I'll go with [Neutral] as there are mixed signals but without sufficient data on specific financial indicators."
2015-09-02,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user has given me five tweets, each addressing different financial topics, and I need to assess each one based on whether they're positive, neutral, or negative.

First, looking at tweet 1: ""rt AT_USER sell google : 3 key metrics telling you why $ goog URL URL"". It seems like this is an automated message from a Twitter user suggesting selling Google stock. That's a direct action towards reducing inventory, which could be seen as both positive and negative depending on the context. But since it's a straightforward recommendation without any conflicting information or potential risks, maybe it's considered neutral.

Next, tweet 2: ""sentishiftdown $ gpro $ amzn $ goog $ googl $ btu $ amba $ any $ gdx $ nflx $ ung sentiquant fintech 2015090 2 10:00 : 05:294 URL"". This looks like a technical or financial analysis of various companies, specifically mentioning fintech. However, without knowing the context of what ""sentishiftdown"" means here and how it affects Google's stock price, it's hard to assess the sentiment directly.

Tweet 3 is about institutional ownership increasing for Google: ""rt portfolioarmor : an alternative to cash for a risk-averse investor $ brk . b $ goog $ isrg $ …"". This seems like a strategic move by investors, which could be both positive if they're looking to diversify or negative if it's seen as risky. But again, without more context, it's tough to say.

Tweet 4: ""rt AT_USER citron stayed away but finally time to short $ nflx . comp heating up and doesnt have another trick like $ aapl $ goog $ amz …"". Here, the user is expressing a desire to take over a company they think is undervalued. This could be seen as aggressive buying or potentially negative if the company is struggling.

Tweet 5: ""rt AT_USER how $ goog could rig the 2016 election bigdata URL"". This tweet suggests that Google's stock might be influencing the outcome of an upcoming election. That seems like a highly speculative and possibly positive statement, especially if it's taken out of context or not related to company performance.

Lastly, tweet 6: ""rt AT_USER how $ goog could rig the 2016 election bigdata URL"". Similar to tweet 5, this is again talking about Google influencing an election. It might be seen as speculative and potentially positive, but without concrete evidence of how this would affect Google's stock price.

Putting it all together, some tweets are straightforward actions (tweets 1 and 4), while others are speculative or strategic moves (tweets 2, 3, 5, 6). These can vary in impact depending on the context. Since there's no specific company provided to analyze, I need to make a general judgment based on these trends.

Positive tweets include suggesting selling stocks (tweet 1) and expressing willingness to take over (tweets 4-6). Negative would be something that reduces inventory or is risky, but without specifics, it's ambiguous. Neutral might come from vague statements about fintech analysis (tweet 2). 

After considering all these factors, I'll conclude with a neutral overall sentiment because while some tweets have positive actions, others are speculative and less clear on their impact."
2015-09-03,Positive,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on stock prices. The user wants me to determine whether each tweet is positive, neutral, or negative based on their content.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the tweets provided, they all mention $ goog, which is Google's symbol. So, the target stock here is Google. That makes sense because all the mentions are of Google-related terms.

Now, let's go through each tweet one by one and break them down into factors. For each tweet, I'll separate positive (P) and negative (N) factors, then assess their impact on investor sentiment.

Starting with the first tweet: ""Solving Process> 1. $ twtr acquisition rumors re-emerge as ceo hunt drags on URL $ goog $ googl $ fb URL"". The user is talking about rumors of a Google acquisition, which might affect stock prices if investors think it's bad news or good news. The term ""rumors"" suggests uncertainty, but the phrase mentions ""reemerges,"" so there could be renewed interest. However, since it's an ongoing topic and not directly related to Google, I'm leaning towards neutral.

Moving on to tweet 2: ""578.57 % gains for subscribers & we have a massive new penny stock pick coming today ! huge update : URL $ ibm $ goog $ aapl"". This tweet talks about subscriber gains and a new penny stock, which is typically attractive to investors looking for cheap, reliable assets like penny stocks. The mention of ""massive new penny stock"" suggests positive news because it's a potentially profitable investment. This could lead to higher demand, hence the percentage increase in subscribers might indicate good sentiment.

The third tweet: ""$ goog oi for maturity 09/04 / 2015 . 605.00 highest put . 650.00 highest call . URL"". This seems like a news about options trading with specific strike prices reaching their highest points on September 4, 2015. While this might affect investor sentiment by influencing option pricing models or stock behavior in related markets, it doesn't directly mention Google's performance. It could still be considered slightly negative because moving out of the money might have some impact, but I think it leans more towards neutral as it's speculative and not a direct price movement.

The fourth tweet: ""$ goog $ googl : microsoft just copied one of google ’ s most exciting new android … : URL URL"". Here, Google is comparing itself to Microsoft by mentioning an Android product. This could be seen as positive if the comparison highlights benefits or advancements in tech. However, since it's a general statement without specifics on how this affects stock prices, it might not have a significant enough impact on the overall sentiment.

Now, combining all these factors:

1. First tweet: Neutral (some uncertainty about Google's future)
2. Second tweet: Positive (new penny stocks are attractive)
3. Third tweet: Neutral ( speculative news)
4. Fourth tweet: Neutral (possible positive impact from tech comparison)

Looking at the options given ([Positive], [Neutral], [Negative]), it seems like the overall sentiment is a mix of some positive and neutral factors. There's no clear dominant factor here, so I should probably consider an overallneutral stance because there are conflicting viewpoints.

Wait, but in the previous response, I concluded Neutral. Now, with this new analysis, it's actually more about Positive from the second tweet. So, maybe that pulls the overall sentiment towards Positive despite some neutral points.

But wait, the third tweet is speculative and could be seen as a bit of a toss-up, so perhaps still leaning towards Neutral. But since the main positive factor comes from the second tweet, which is quite strong, I think it's better to go with Positive as the overall impact."
2015-09-04,Negative,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price of MSFT. The user provided five tweets and asked me to analyze their impact using [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative] labels.

First, I need to identify each tweet separately because they might influence different factors. Let's go through them one by one.

1. **rt $ nflx hft algos broke 98.00 in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 11:12 p / t 90.00 quant $ msft $ fb $ gpro $ amzn $ fb $ goog $ tsla $ aapl $ qqq**

   This tweet mentions that some stocks broke below certain prices like NFLX and GFOO (which I think is GOOG, Google). It's providing market context. The language is neutral but seems to suggest market conditions are improving or stable. Maybe this gives investors a bit of clarity on the overall market.

2. **rt $ qqq hft algos broke 101.85 in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 13:59 . p / t 100.00 quant $ msft $ fb $ gpro $ amzn $ fb $ goog $ tsla $ nflx $ aapl**

   Similar to the first tweet, it's talking about stock prices and providing market context again. It seems neutral but provides similar information to make investors aware of current conditions.

3. **$ goog URL the hottest startups of 2014 URL**

   This is a link request. The word ""url"" makes me think it might be a typo or an error in formatting, maybe a typo for Google Search. If someone links to something about startups from 2014, that could potentially affect Google's performance because startups are a big part of the company's revenue. So, this tweet is likely negative because it can negatively impact MSFT by lowering its search engine ranking.

4. **rt $ nflx hft algos broke 98.00 in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 09:59 p / t 90.00 quant $ msft $ fb $ gpro $ amzn $ fb $ goog $ tsla $ aapl $ qqq**

   Again, this tweet is providing stock price information and market context. It seems neutral but gives the same kind of data again to keep the conversation going.

5. **we need universal messaging & we need it now URL AT_USER if only $ goog $ aapl would do this ! commonsense sms mms**

   This tweet sounds like it's in Chinese, which is common in social media platforms where users post in their native language for international audiences. It seems to express urgency about getting funding or reaching out to specific companies. This can be seen as negative because reaching out to investors might improve the stock price.

Now, summarizing each tweet:

- The first tweet provides market context.
- The second does the same but again.
- The third links to a past event that could negatively impact MSFT.
- The fourth gives more market info.
- The fifth is in Chinese and seems to express an urgent need for funding or reaching out.

The main issues here are:

1. Potential negative link from 2014 startups affecting Google's search engine ranking, which might lower MSFT's stock price negatively.
2. Urgent message suggesting a need for funding or collaboration with competitors, which could drive the stock up positively if taken seriously.

Since there are both potential negative and positive impacts, it's hard to say for sure without more context. However, the negative tweet (number 3) is probably enough to make this tweet negative overall."
2015-09-05,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for a given company. The target stock symbols are Google (GOOGL) and BetaWarner (BWWarner). Let me break down each tweet one by one.

First tweet is about closing the bell report from Google and other companies. It mentions closing the bell, which might indicate some events happening around that time, but it doesn't directly impact the stock price of GOOGL or BWWarner. So, this seems neutral.

Second tweet talks about Apple (AAPL) stockology reaching a high for their upcoming ""critical event."" The term ""critical event"" often signifies something significant that could cause immediate changes in stock prices. Since it's related to an upcoming event, especially if it's positive, I'll mark this as Positive.

Third tweet has a bunch of AT_USER mentions and some flags. These seem like social media posts from users, which can be speculative. Without concrete information about the company or any positive/negative factors, it's hard to assess their impact on GOOGL or BWA. So, probably Neutral.

Fourth tweet asks for my last price target for Apple, Google, Tesla, and Google again. While targeting specific stocks is a common strategy in trading, asking for targets doesn't provide any direct information about future stock performance. It might suggest some interest from investors but isn't conclusive evidence of positive or negative sentiment. So, this tweet could be considered Neutral.

Putting it all together: One Positive from the second tweet, and others are eitherneutral or speculative. The overall sentiment leans slightly towards Positive because one tweet is clear on a critical event that could impact their prices."
2015-09-06,Positive,"Okay, I need to figure out the likely impact on the stock price of the given company based on these tweets. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the target stock is not explicitly provided in the tweets, so maybe it doesn't matter? Or perhaps the stock is a well-known one like Apple or Google. Since the user didn't specify, I'll assume they're referring to a tech company like Apple, which makes sense because both goog and aapl are related.

Looking at the tweets, both mention ""the week ahead webinar – september 5th , 2015 URL"". That's interesting. The fact that there was a webinar in September might indicate some sort of event affecting the stock, maybe earnings reports or product launches.

Next, I need to separate positive and negative factors from each tweet. Each tweet seems to have multiple companies mentioned: $ goog, $ spy, $ qqq, $ ma, $ apl, $ twtr. These could be related stock symbols for different companies. But without knowing which ones are positive or negative, it's a bit tricky. Let me think about the context of these stocks.

Since both webinars were scheduled around September 5th and the URL is given as a hyperlink, maybe this refers to an earnings announcement? Earnings reports can significantly impact stock prices because they're a key indicator of company performance.

Now, considering each company:

- GOOGL (Google) is known for its cloud services. If there's an earnings report around that time, it could boost the stock.
- QQQ (etCode) might not be as important as Google or Apple but still relevant if it's about software updates or something else related.
- MA (Meta) is a big name in AI and 5G technology, so they might have a significant impact on their stock price.
- APL (Apple) is clearly a major tech company. An earnings report for them could affect the stock price significantly.

The fact that both Google and Meta are involved makes me think about broader market trends around September 5th. However, since the specific event isn't detailed, it's hard to tell exactly what influenced the sentiment. But generally, financial announcements can be positive or negative depending on the company and their performance.

If there was an earnings report from a major tech company like Apple or Meta, that could definitely affect the stock price positively because investors expect good revenue and profit margins. However, if it's a unrelated event, maybe it's neutral or even negative.

But looking at both Google and Meta being mentioned along with a webinar, perhaps it's about an upcoming announcement in September which could have a medium-term positive impact on their respective stocks. But without knowing the outcome of that report, I can't be certain.

I think the overall sentiment might lean towards [Positive] because if there's any significant event related to tech companies like Google or Meta around that time, it could drive stock prices. Alternatively, if it's unrelated and negative, it might be neutral, but since both are tech stocks, they have more weight in the market.

Wait, the user mentioned ""webinar – september 5th"", which is specific. Maybe the webinar was about an upcoming earnings call or something similar. If so, that could lead to positive sentiment because investors are waiting for the details of a major announcement.

I'm leaning towards [Positive] because both companies in question are significant tech firms, and their stock prices can be influenced by such announcements. Unless there's some negative information related to either, it's likely to have a positive impact."
2015-09-07,Negative,"Alright, I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for a given company. The output should be either [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative].

First, let's look at each tweet one by one.

The first tweet says: ""hey , do you know everything while trading sp500 ? $ goog $ jnj $ ge URL URL"". It seems like it's asking for information about trading the S&P 500. There's no positive or negative info here; it's more of a request. So, probably neutral because it doesn't provide any meaningful direction.

The second tweet: ""rt AT_USER via AT_USER why google is going all in on diabetes URL afrezza inhalableinsulin $ goog $ sny $ mnkd"". The user mentions Google spending money on something called ""diabetes"" and a company called AFREZ. I'm not sure if this relates to diabetes or the company's stock. It seems a bit random, so likely neutral since there's no clear positive or negative information.

The third tweet: ""a look at apple's fourth quarter results : URL $ aapl $ goog $ pcln $ k URL"". Apple's financial results are usually analyzed for market trends. This tweet is about the company's performance and could provide insight into investor sentiment. However, it doesn't mention any positive or negative aspects related to the stock price.

Combining all three tweets: The first is just a question, the second is random mentions of diabetes spending, and the third is about Apple's financial results. None of these provide strong information about the stock price direction. They might be trying to engage with the user but don't offer any direct data or analysis relevant to the stock.

So, overall, there isn't enough positive or negative info here. It seems neutral because none of the tweets suggest a clear trend in the stock price."
2015-09-08,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company based on the given examples. The user provided six tweets, each in different languages but focusing on tech-related stocks like Apple (AAPL) or Google (GOOG). 

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet because that's crucial for assessing the sentiment accurately. Looking at the first tweet, it mentions URL and includes spreads for tech giants, which is more about financial instruments than a specific company. The second tweet uses ""TSLA"" in quotes, which likely stands for Tesla, so I can note that Apple might be on the table here. 

Moving to the third tweet, it's very generic with multiple currencies, no specific stock mentioned. The fourth tweet talks about Google testing grocery deliveries but asks if Apple will have good customer service. That seems like a positive tip because sometimes companies are optimistic about each other, especially in competitive industries. The fifth tweet mentions real estate and cryptocurrency, which doesn't directly relate to tech stocks.

The sixth tweet again lists multiple tech stocks: Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), IBM (IBM), Google, and Tesla. It's clear that these are all tech companies, but the context is about real estate and crypto, so it's less relevant. 

Now, analyzing each tweet:

1. The first tweet seems to be introducing spreads related to tech giants, which could indicate a general level of activity or concern in the market, possibly negative if there are concerns about regulatory issues or economic factors.

2. ""TSLA"" being mentioned suggests Apple is on focus, so that's positive for Apple stock.

3. This one doesn't specify a company but talks about currency and speculative assets, which could have mixed signals but not directly related to the stock.

4. The tweet about customer service indicates a tip or suggestion from another company to another company in tech, which can sometimes affect investor sentiment positively because it's a positive move towards diversification and potential growth.

5. Real estate mentions might be unrelated, so this tweet doesn't have much impact on the stocks mentioned.

6. Again, all companies here are tech-related but with other topics, so less relevant to stock performance.

Putting it all together: The first tweet introduces multiple tech stocks but may imply concerns about broader market issues. The second tweet focuses on Apple's real estate focus, which is positive for Apple. The fourth tweet offers a customer service tip, suggesting potential growth in that area. However, the other tweets don't directly target any stock and are mostly unrelated to tech.

So overall, I think there's some positive sentiment from the tech-focused tweets pointing towards Apple or Google, but the first tweet's introduction is somewhat negative due to broader market implications."
2015-09-09,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for a given company. The user provided specific steps and sample output, so let me break it down step by step.

First, the target stock symbol isn't listed among the tweets, which is fine because without identifying the stock, I can't make an accurate analysis. 

Looking at each tweet:

1. ""ashr db x-trackers harvest csi 300 china a-shares fund shares URL $ ashr $ goog $ dust $ rsx ashr invest tradeideas"" - This seems to be related to ETFs or funds, possibly with some financial terms. It mentions the Shanghai 500 index (CSI 300) and US stocks. Since it's talking about investments and stock symbols, it might influence investor sentiment positively if they're a good investment.

2. ""$ goog $ googl to start testing grocery deliveries this year URL URL"" - This tweet is likely from an investor trying to test their strategy related to grocery delivery companies. It mentions Google and uses the word ""to start,"" which suggests potential growth in the tech sector, especially with Google's popularity in tech products.

3. ""$ gequ is up 942.86 % for our platinum members ! get early access to our new pick : URL $ ibm $ goog $ aapl"" - Here, they're comparing investments and mention that platinum members are getting early access. It seems like this could be encouraging investors in tech companies, which might boost the stock price positively.

4. ""rt wrigleytom : $ aapl $ goog $ googl china smartphone market insights for q2 2015 URL … URL"" - This tweet is likely from an investor sharing insights on the Chinese smartphone market for Q2 2015. It might indicate broader tech sector trends, especially if there's interest in Android devices or other tech companies.

5. ""$ a dutch archaeologist found a lost castle they had stopped looking for 20 years ago , using google earth . $ goog $ go … URL"" - This tweet is likely from someone who found an ancient castle and uses Google Earth. It could be a positive story about innovation or investment in new technologies, which might positively impact the stock.

6. ""$ aapl $ msft $ googl $ goog playing apple's big announcement today . URL URL"" - Comparing Apple's announcements with other tech companies like Google and Microsoft. This comparison might create uncertainty but if Apple is expected to launch something valuable, it could be seen as a good opportunity, thus positive sentiment.

7. ""$ sap sap se market cap URL $ sap $ cvc $ goog $ skx sap trade ideas tradeideas"" - Similar to previous ones, mentions investments in tech companies. It's a general investment advice tweet, which might not have immediate impact unless it's from a high-value ETF or fund.

8. ""$ you could be paying 5x higher spreads for us tech giants URL $ aapl $ goog $ msft $ fb $ twtr spreadbetting cfd"" - This suggests that investing in tech companies could result in higher returns, possibly due to market volatility or strategic moves. It might indicate investment opportunities that can boost stock prices.

Summarizing each tweet's impact: Each one is from investors sharing information on tech companies, products, or trends. They're talking about investments, potential growth, or upcoming projects. These signals are often positive indicators for investor sentiment because they show the company has a strong fundamentals and possibly future plans. Therefore, the overall sentiment seems positive."
2015-09-10,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on stock prices. The user provided 14 tweets related to different stocks, so I need to break them down step by step.

First, the target is to extract each stock symbol from the tweets. Let's see:

1. The first tweet mentions $fb$, which probably stands for FB.
2. The second includes qld and gdx, but these might be proxies or abbreviations for specific stocks like Qld Group or Gold Fund.
3. Google is mentioned multiple times with different symbols, so that's obvious.

Now, each tweet needs to be analyzed as a factor (Positive/Negative) and sentiment towards investors. Since it's a small dataset, I'll have to assess each one individually.

Starting with the first tweet: FB, but without context or specific factors, it's hard to tell if it's positive or negative. Similarly, other tweets might be positive about Google's stock performance.

Looking at each tweet:

1. The first tweet seems neutral because it mentions several tech stocks and doesn't provide clear sentiment.
2. The second tweet talks about Qld Group and GDX funds, which are probably tech-focused companies, so maybe positive if GDX is seen as a good investment.
3. The third tweet updates Google's price target, which might suggest investor confidence in their stock performance.
4. The fourth mentions LMT and DHI, which could be related to financial services or healthcare, possibly neutral or slightly positive depending on the companies.
5. The fifth tweet compares iPhones 6s with Android phones, suggesting tech trends but not clearly about stocks.
6. The sixth refers to a Google update regarding stock options, possible for investor sentiment boost.
7. The seventh mentions Google's price target update, which is a buy signal.
8. Happy Birthday for SONY, PS4 launch—this could be positive as it's a major launch event affecting the market.
9. AT_USER suggesting watching robotics stocks, which might mean investors are concerned about security, so negative sentiment.
10. Google updating analytics tools for developers, which is good for tech firms.
11. Apple and cortana putting pressure on Siri—it could be negative due to competing products or privacy concerns.
12. A question about whether GOGO will break away from a triangle, indicating investor interest in its long-term growth.
13. A call offer related to iPhones 6s—could suggest positive trends as tech companies like Apple are doing well.
14. Suggestions for brokers trading tech giants, which is positive investment sentiment.

Now, combining all these, I notice several tweets that are positive about Google's stock (like price targets and product launches) and some that are negative (ramping up on privacy issues). The overall sentiment seems balanced with a mix of positive and negative factors. Without more context or significant movements, the impact is likely neutral."
2015-09-11,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the company. Let me start by understanding what each tweet is about.

First tweet: $gequ is a fast-growing penny stock with huge news. It mentions things like URL and other companies related to Google. Since gequ seems positive, especially mentioning big names like Google, it's likely good for investors. So that's a strong positive point.

Second tweet: Micron Technology has short sales. Short sales usually indicate investor confidence; they're betting against the stock because others are selling it out. That could be a negative sign because short positions can affect stock prices. But I'm not sure if this is enough to outweigh other positives from the first tweet.

Third tweet: Plug Power Inc is involved in power semiconductors. They mention URL, which might mean they're related to Google or other tech companies. This looks like positive news for a tech stock, so another positive point.

Fourth tweet: RT AT_USER reacting to blocking Apple ads. It says it's about killing Google's business model and links to a YouTube video. That sounds like a negative message because blocking ads might damage the company's business operations. However, there's a link mentioned too, which could mean more information, but that's just one tweet.

Fifth tweet: AT_USER ranting about obscurity of uncertainty and getting older. It mentions Twitter, Google, Apple, Facebook, and MSFT with some quotes from an audience. This seems like a negative outlook because it's talking about things that might be bad for the stock, like becoming obsolete or people losing their minds.

Sixth tweet: $ goog - Yahoo is marketing to join STX entertainment. If they're marketing efforts to build another company, it could have mixed effects. Maybe positive if it helps in diversifying or getting into new areas, but also negative if it dilutes the current stock price because it's taking a large chunk out of Google.

Now, putting this all together: The first tweet gives strong hope. Plug Power and Micron Technology are tech stocks which can be volatile. AT_USER is making a negative comment, possibly affecting investor sentiment negatively. The short sales might pull down prices, though the positive points from gequ and plug power could counteract that. The mention of blocking ads could hurt the stock if it impacts their business model, but since they have other income sources like revenue or even partnerships with tech companies, maybe this is a bit uncertain.

So overall, there are both strong positives and some negative factors. But I think the positive tweets outweigh the negatives enough to give a positive sentiment."
2015-09-12,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided three tweets and asked me to assess each based on factors like target stock symbol, positive or negative factors, and overall sentiment.

First, let's identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at tweet 1: ""google and twitter to launch joint venture , compete with facebook URL $ fb $ goog $ googl $ twtr."" Hmm, it mentions Google (GOOG), Twitter (TWTR is actually Twitter, but in this case, maybe it's referring to a typo or specific company). Wait, no, the tweet uses ""twtr"" which I think is a typo for ""twitter."" So the target stock might be GOOG and TWTR. But since the output requires one tag, perhaps it's referring to Google. Or maybe both? Maybe it's two stocks: GOOG and TWTR.

Wait, but looking at other tweets, tweet 2 and 3 also mention GOOG. Let me double-check:

Tweet 1 says ""google and twitter to launch joint venture , compete with facebook URL $ fb $ goog $ googl $ twtr."" So maybe the target is Google (GOOG) and Twitter (TWTR). But in the output, I'm supposed to conclude with one tag. Maybe it's about both? Or perhaps just focus on GOOG since it's more prominent.

Wait, but let me look at tweet 2: "" $ googl $ goog $ yhoo news : ' tricky times for yahoo : cash out and move on $ googl … ' URL analyze … URL."" This seems to mention YHOO (YOK) and perhaps GOOG. So maybe the target is both? But the output says ""[Positive]"" or others, so probably one stock per tweet.

Wait, maybe the target stock is just Google because that's more prominent in the first tweet. Let me think about each tweet:

Tweet 1: Looks like it mentions two stocks, but perhaps focusing on Google since it's mentioned later. It talks about competing with Facebook and launching a joint venture with Twitter. So possible factors could be Google's performance, Facebook's performance, Twitter's performance.

But the target stock is ""google and twitter to launch joint venture , compete with facebook URL $ fb $ goog $ googl $ twtr."" So maybe it's referring to Google and TwTR as the target stocks? Or perhaps just Google because it's more obvious.

Wait, in tweet 1: ""google and twitter to launch joint venture , compete with facebook URL $ fb $ goog $ googl $ twtr."" So maybe the target is Google (GOOG) since that's mentioned in both parts. So perhaps only GOOG?

But the output requires a single tag, so probably just one.

Looking at tweet 2: "" $ googl $ goog $ yhoo news : ' tricky times for yahoo : cash out and move on $ googl … ' URL analyze … URL."" So factors are Google (GOOG) and YHOO (YOK). Both could be positive or negative.

But in this case, the tweet is talking about cashing out after YHOO's performance. It might indicate a negative sentiment if YHOO's stock is down. But since both are mentioned, it's tricky.

Tweet 3: "" $ goog $ pcln $ vtae."" So factors are Google (GOOG), PCLN, and VTAE. Probably positive factors for GOOG as they're tech companies that go up in value when their stock does well.

Now, summarizing each tweet:

1. Tweet 1: Factors include Google's performance, Facebook, and Twitter. Likely mixed, but with a focus on Google.
2.Tweet 2: Includes Google, Yahoo, and YHOO. More negative as it mentions cashing out after Yahoo losing.
3.Tweet 3: Positive factors for Google since PCLN and VTAE are tech companies.

Putting it all together, the sentiment is likely positive because while tweet 1 talks about a joint venture with Twitter but focuses on Google, which could be a good sign if they perform well. Tweet 2 mentions YHOO losing, which might make it negative, but overall, the target stock (Google) and other factors are favorable. So overall, it's leaning positive."
2015-09-13,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze the given tweets about the stock price of a company and determine whether they are positive, neutral, or negative. Let's go through each tweet step by step.

Starting with the first tweet: ""cci probe : google wants access to documents held back by watchdog - … URL google $ goog $ googl … URL"". It seems like Google is being investigated by a cci group, which could potentially affect their stock price. I'm not sure about the exact impact yet, but the mention of an investigation makes me think it might be positive because it's related to the company's security and trustworthiness.

Moving on to the second tweet: ""jbem ' picks - free membership - join here : URL $ googl $ goog $ cabo $ uhal $ good $ csbk $ clbh $ rnf"". This tweet is a bit unclear. It looks like there are some words mixed up, maybe typo? The mention of Google ($ googl) and something about 'good' sounds positive. It seems like they're offering something or suggesting joining, which might be a sign of optimism for the stock.

The third tweet: ""$ goog high open interest range is 635.00 to 635.00 for option expiration 09/18 / 2015 . URL"". The mention of ""high"" and specific details about open interest (open interest usually refers to the volume of shares available for trading) could indicate market conditions are favorable, suggesting a positive impact on stock price.

The fourth tweet: ""$ goog URL the rich are already paying for puerto Rico's problems URL"". This is more controversial. The idea that companies are covering their back doors to certain regions suggests potential manipulation or insider financing. However, since it's about the rich and specific issues in Puerto Rico, it might not directly affect the stock price as much as the previous ones. It could be seen as negative due to possible financial manipulation.

Now, summarizing:
1. First tweet: Positive.
2. Second tweet: Still positive but unclear.
3. Third tweet: Slightly positive with some uncertainty about open interest.
4. Fourth tweet: Negative because of possible manipulation and specific regional issues.

Considering all these, the overall sentiment is leaning towards a mix. But since the majority are positive, I think it's more likely to be positive overall."
2015-09-14,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me break it down step by step.

First, each tweet seems to be related to Google stock prices or related financial terms. My task is to assess whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative in terms of affecting the stock. I'll need to go through each tweet one by one and evaluate them.

Starting with the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER congrats 2 gold members locking 25 % + gain on $ nflx this morn ka-ching $ amzn $ goog $ googl $ qqq $ fb stocks AT_USER"". This seems like a congratulatory message from a user, specifically mentioning that they've earned two gold memberships. It doesn't mention any positive or negative news about Google itself, so I'm not sure what effect this has on the stock price. Maybe it's just a personal update without concrete information.

Moving to the second tweet: ""rt stockjumper : $ goog $ aapl $ twtr weekend video - update from option millionaires - stock options chatroom come … URL"". This is a bit confusing, but it mentions that Google is doing well and possibly updating their stock options. I'm not sure what kind of impact this could have on Google's stock price. It might be positive, but without more context, it's hard to tell.

Third tweet: ""rt AT_USER russia declares google violated competition rules ; yandex spikes URL $ goog $ googl $ yndx"". This tweet is about a user from Russia declaring that Google violated competition rules and mentions Yandex. While this could potentially affect competition, it doesn't directly relate to Google's stock performance. So, I'm leaning towards neutral here.

Fourth tweet: ""AT_USER $ goog google hires auto industry heavweight to lead self-driving car business URL"". This is about Google hiring someone in the auto industry focused on leading a self-driving car company. This could be seen as positive because it might improve their market position or efficiency. However, without knowing how this affects the overall stock price or any specific factors like earnings or competition, it's hard to judge.

Fifth tweet: ""$ goog $ aapl $ twtr morning charts - update from option millionaires - stock options chatroom we start the week with … URL"". Similar to the second tweet, this seems to be an update related to Google and their stock options. It might influence investor sentiment but without more details on what's happening, it's difficult to assess the impact on the stock price.

Putting all these together: The first tweet is a personal congratulatory message, which could be seen as positive but without concrete information. The second tweet talks about stock performance, which can have short-term effects. The third and fourth tweets are more about company news affecting competition or their business strategy. The fifth tweet is another update related to Google options.

Since none of these tweets provide direct information that would significantly impact the overall stock price or any specific factors like earnings, I think the overall sentiment might be neutral because there's no clear positive or negative indication."
2015-09-15,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets and figure out their impact on the stock price for a given company. Let's start by breaking down each tweet.

The first tweet mentions $ uso investing and mentions the US oil fund, but it doesn't provide specific information about the stock or any positive or negative factors. So, this one seems too vague to influence investor sentiment much.

Moving on to the second tweet, it talks about our stock picks going over 3500% in the past year. That's a huge gain, which suggests good performance. It also mentions ""new pick"" and provides an example with $ ibm. While impressive, it doesn't specify if this is positive or negative for the company. It might be a signal of strong fundamentals, but without context, I'm not sure about the impact on stock price.

The third tweet discusses Google and Twitter partnering for better news delivery. This could indicate that there's an investment in improving their communication tools, which might influence the market indirectly. But it's still speculative enough to be ambiguous.

Lastly, the fourth tweet talks about a CEO speaking at a conference, mentioning something related to ""elephant in the room"" issues and Google. It seems like it's providing information without any obvious positive or negative implications for the stock price. There's no concrete data here either.

Considering all these tweets, none provide enough specific information to determine the stock's direction. The first tweet is too broad, the second has a high positive note but could be misleading if the company isn't doing well. The third and fourth are speculative and offer little to no insight into the stock's performance. Therefore, it seems like there's not enough data to conclude whether the stock is going up, neutral, or down."
2015-09-16,Negative,"Alright, let's see what I need to do here. The user has provided several tweets and wants me to determine their likely impact on the stock price of a company based on those tweets. They've given me an output format that expects one of three responses: [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, I'll start by parsing each tweet to extract relevant information. The target stock seems to be GM because some tweets mention it in their links. So, I can focus on how these tweets affect the stock price for GM.

Looking at tweet 1, ""charlie rose meets fortune’s most powerful women : URL."" Hmm, that's not directly related to GM or any other known company, so probably not relevant here.

Tweet 2 says, ""rt AT_USER $ goog $ googl $ aapl fed up - update from option millionaires - stock options chatroom i'll be brief tonight . it's ..."" I don't see any mention of GM in this tweet. It seems more about stocks and options, so maybe not impactful on GM.

Tweet 3 mentions ""goog google inc . - class c yield URL $ goog $ enip $ uwti $ fv goog pennystocks stocks."" This is talking about Google's performance, which doesn't directly relate to GM either. So probably no impact here.

Tweet 4 is: ""rt $ nflx hft algos triggered buy in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 08:33 p / t 105.00 quant $ msft $ fb $ gpro $ amzn $ fb $ goog $ tsla $ aapl $ qqq."" This tweet seems to be discussing stock buys from companies related to football teams, not GM. So, no impact on GM here.

Tweet 5 says: ""rt AT_USER unstoppable tech innovation in september : a dislike button ( $ fb ) a pencil ( aapl ) a logo ( $ goog )."" Again, unrelated to GM or any other known company, so probably nothing to consider for GM.

Tweet 6 and 7 are identical. They mention ""stockoptions investing AT_USER $ tsla $ amzn $ goog …."" These are other stocks, not related to GM. So no impact there either.

After reviewing all the tweets, none of them mention GM or any other company that affects GM's stock price. The tweets are more about general stock buys from tech companies and unrelated topics. Therefore, it seems like these tweets don't provide any information to influence the stock price of GM."
2015-09-17,Missing,File not found
2015-09-18,Missing,File not found
2015-09-19,Negative,"Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has given me some tweets related to stock market topics and asked me to determine if each tweet is positive, negative, or neutral in terms of impact on a company's stock price. I need to consider the information provided for each tweet.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""vxx ipath s & p 500 vix short-term futures etn message board posts URL $ vxx $ g.to $ goog $ soxl vxx pennystocks stock."" Hmm, it's about some ETFs on the S&P 500. The mention of long-only ETFs seems like a negative factor because they might limit growth opportunities for winners. But I'm not sure if this is enough to make it positive or neutral.

Next tweet: ""goog google inc . - class c investor opinions URL $ goog $ jnj $ len $ xle goog invest invest."" This looks like investor opinion posts. Investors often share their thoughts on the stock, which can influence price movements but don't necessarily give a clear overall sentiment without more context.

Third tweet: ""goog google inc . - class c financials URL $ goog $ cvc $ vvus $ lag goog pennystocks stock."" Similar to the second tweet, this is about investor opinions, likely from financials. Again, just opinions might not be enough on their own.

Fourth tweet: ""goog google inc . - class c financials URL $ goog $ intc $ nugt $ wfc goog tradeideas finance."" Again, focusing on financials and investors' viewpoints. It's possible this is a mix of positive (investors looking to buy stocks) and negative (those concerned about competitors), so it might be neutral.

Fifth tweet: ""$ aapl news : "" will ad blocking be google's kryptonite ? $ aapl apple $ goog $ googl "" URL analyze … URL."" This seems more towards technology. The mention of ad blocking by Google is a known issue, which could lead to negative sentiment from investors who might worry about competition or innovation costs. It does seem like a potential negative factor.

Now, putting it all together. Each tweet contributes to the overall sentiment. The third tweet has only financials and opinions, so maybe neutral. But since the first tweet is about S&P 500 ETFs, which are long-only, that's definitely negative. Then there's this fifth tweet about a major tech issue. So even though others are neutral or negative, the overall trend might be negative because of the significant event mentioned.

I should summarize all these to say the overall sentiment is negative."
2015-09-20,Neutral,"Okay, so I have to figure out whether these tweets are positive, negative, or neutral in terms of their impact on the stock price of a company. Let's go through each tweet one by one.

Starting with tweet 1: It says, ""what is it ahead for us tech giants ? check what analyst have to say $ goog $ twtr $ aapl URL … URL."" Hmm, this seems like an informational post asking for quotes from analysts and checking the stock prices. That's more about news and information rather than predicting or influencing investor sentiment.

Moving on to tweet 2: ""ctxs citrix systems , inc . quotes URL $ ctxs $ nat $ goog $ regn ctxs tradeideas invest."" This is an investment quote, so it looks like someone is expressing their opinion or suggesting they might buy the stock. It's a bit more of a statement from someone's perspective rather than affecting the market.

Tweet 3: ""goog google inc . - class c market cap URL $ goog $ pbr $ ual $ kr goog invest stock."" This seems to be a market analysis tweet, stating that Google is in class C with a P/B ratio and UAL. It might be providing technical or financial info, but it doesn't seem to indicate positive or negative sentiment towards the stock.

Tweet 4: Similar to tweet 3, ""goog google inc . - class c market cap URL $ goog $ pbr $ ual $ kr goog invest stock."" Again, just stating market data without any predicting actions.

Now, tweet 5: "" $ aapl releases ad blocker , not sure what $ goog and $ fb are feeing like . tracking this until q3 and q4 results."" This is about Google's product release, specifically mentioning the ad blocker. It seems to be providing information on the future of products but isn't predicting market movements or giving any analysis.

Tweet 6: "" $ gpro another blast from the past - URL $ aapl $ gild $ goog $ googl $ pcln $ spy $ z $ qqq $ nflx $ gld $ baba $ amba $ tlt."" This looks like an exchange-traded fund (ETF) review, suggesting someone is considering investing in GPRO. It's more of a recommendation rather than any indication of sentiment towards the stock.

So, summarizing each tweet:

1. Informational query.
2. Investment quote.
3. Market analysis.
4. Another market analysis.
5. Industry update on products.
6. ETF review.

None of these seem to provide positive or negative cues about the stock price. They're more about providing information, opinions, or product updates without predicting performance. Therefore, my initial thought is that each tweet contributes somewhat positively by giving context but doesn't tip the balance in favor of positive, negative, or neutral sentiment."
2015-09-21,Neutral,"Alright, I need to determine the impact on the stock price of the company based on these tweets. Let's go through each tweet step by step.

First, the target stock is identified from the tweets. Looking at the tweets, it seems like ""googl"" and ""apple"" are being mentioned, so the target symbol is likely Google Inc., which has the ticker symbol ""GOOG"".

Next, I'll analyze each tweet for Positive (P) or Negative (N) factors.

1. The first tweet mentions Google can develop free software to block ad-blockers. That sounds positive because it's a potential improvement in their technology and could lead to more users being protected. So this is a Positive tweet.

2. The second tweet talks about upgrades for Apple, NVIDIA, and other companies like Cyberark. This suggests that there are planned changes or improvements in these sectors. As Google might be looking at competitors, this could be a positive factor because it shows potential growth areas. So another Positive tweet.

3. The third tweet mentions rocket fivers selling on sigma-x, crossfinder, and ats. These seem like financial instruments used by stock traders. While this is related to trading, it's not directly impacting the company itself. So no significant impact here.

4. The fourth tweet has a mix of positive language: Google's symbol and terms like ""Monday morning reads."" This is more about sentiment than anything specific to the stock, so probably Neutral.

5. The fifth tweet points out that ad-blocking fears could hit Google stock if they're overdone. This seems like a negative factor because increased competition might lower demand or costs, which can hurt the company. So Negative tweet.

6. The sixth tweet is about Google's fiber rollout being slow and mentioning Motley Capital. While mentions of rollout suggest potential for change, it's more about industry conditions rather than specific to the stock. Still, the mention of ""rollout"" might indicate optimism or concern, but overall not directly related. So Neutral.

7. The seventh tweet talks about Facebook, Google, Apple, and other tech companies. Again, this is about market trends in tech beyond the company itself. So no significant impact on the stock price.

8. The eighth tweet mentions technologies like dislike buttons and a pencil. These are more general terms and don't directly relate to Google's products or operations. Hence, Neutral.

Now, summarizing each tweet:

1. P
2. P
3. No impact
4. N
5. Negative
6. Neutral
7. No impact
8. No impact

Overall, there are two positive tweets (1 and 2), one negative tweet (5), and the rest don't affect the stock directly or moderately. So it's leaning towards a mix of positives and negatives.

Since there's an imbalance with more positive than negative factors, but considering that all other factors either don't impact much or have neutral sentiments, I think the overall sentiment is [Neutral]. It's not overwhelmingly positive because some negative tweets are there, but they're not overwhelming."
2015-09-22,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze the impact on the stock price of a given company based on these tweets. Let me start by understanding what each tweet is saying.

The first tweet says ""top tech stocks ride choppy market."" That seems like it's talking about the overall market being tough or unstable, which can cause investor sentiment to be down. The word ""choppy"" might mean that prices are volatile or fluctuating, but I'm not sure if that's positive or negative.

The second tweet is ""goog $ googl URL $ goog."" It mentions Google and their stock price, so maybe it's talking about the company itself rather than just the market. "" investments in virtual reality start-up"" seems like they're focusing on a new tech company but doesn't specify what that means for the overall market.

The third tweet is about Disney investing in VR. Again, this is more about their own company's projects and doesn't directly talk about market trends or investor sentiment about a specific company listed elsewhere.

So, putting it together: The first tweet affects the broader tech sector which can influence multiple companies. The second tweet is about Google, but without info on Google's performance, I'm not sure. The third tweet is about Disney, which doesn't relate directly to the stock price of another company unless they're related in context.

Given that the user provided a target stock symbol, which isn't here, I need to infer from the tweets. Tech stocks are generally volatile because companies can fluctuate a lot due to market conditions and economic factors. The first tweet mentions the choppy market, which is a common theme in tech stocks that are in the market for a while.

Even though the other tweets don't specify their impact on a particular stock, but more on general tech trends, it's possible that these tweets might indicate uncertainty or lack of confidence in certain sectors. But without specific mention of positive or negative factors related to the target stock, I can't directly assess its impact on the stock price.

I think overall, the information given suggests there's some uncertainty and risk involved, which could lead investors to be cautious about their decisions. But it doesn't specify if this will result in an increase (positive), decrease (negative) or no significant effect (neutral). So, I'll go with [Neutral]."
2015-09-23,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the future stock price of a company. Let's see, first, I should identify each tweet and extract the target stock symbol.

Looking at the tweets:

1. The first tweet mentions Singapore's ishares volume, but it seems like it might be unrelated.
2. Second tweet about hsba and holdings, again unclear context.
3. Third about Google's performance, which is a strong hint of positive news because Google is a big tech company.
4. Fourth refers to short sales for Xlv in 2015. That's more speculative but might show some concern if they're selling stocks.
5. Fifth tweet mentions the S&P 500 and other indices rising, which could indicate strong market conditions, suggesting positive stock performance.
6. Sixth tweet about SSNL paying for Samsung to launch, indicating potential growth in tech or industry.
7. Seventh mentions a buyer's perspective on various companies like Apple, Tesla, etc., which might show investor confidence.
8. Eighth tweet talks about Google launching into China, which is significant as it can drive global revenue and stock price.
9. Ninth refers to randgold resources and their investments in cloudflare, suggesting tech growth and potential stock performance.
10. Tenth mentions Microsoft, Qualcomm, and Baidu collaborating on a joint investment in Cloudflare, aligning with the tech sector's advancements.
11. Eleventh is about HK Halcon Resources' summary, possibly indicating some investment or data release related to tech.
12. Twelfth tweet talks about Unis focusing on the bum's rush, which could imply quick investments or market moves.

Now, for each relevant tweet:

1. Suggests volume but unclear impact.
2. Indicates hsba holdings, speculative context.
3. Google is a major player, likely positive.
4. Short sales might show concerns but not strong sentiment yet.
5. Strong market performance from the S&P suggests upward trend.
6. Technology sector growth, which could be positive.
7. Positive outlook for tech companies, which can boost stock price.
8. Launch in China signals potential expansion and revenue growth.
9. Cloudflare joint investment points to tech advances.
10. Major tech collaborations indicating future strength.
11. HK Halcon's data might show sector activity or new projects.
12. Unis focusing on tech investments could drive further growth.

Overall, the tweets are mostly pointing towards a positive trend, especially Google, tech companies, and major tech collaborations. Speculative ones like short sales might have mixed sentiment, but the more concrete ones suggest confidence in the future."
2015-09-24,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this task. I need to analyze the given tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided five tweets and asked for an overall sentiment conclusion using ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"".

First, I should identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""danrocks 4 : goog google inc . - class c ideas URL $ goog $ hgd.to $ vxx … URL URL"". It seems like DanRoCK is a company with symbol vxx. So, the target stock is VIX.

The second tweet: ""rt AT_USER 30 aug 2015 : uptrend stocks in technology $ adsk $ amd $ ca $ ctsh $ ctxs $ ffiv $ goog $ intu $ irm $ jbl URL"". The user mentions AT_USER and probably a tech company. Maybe AT&T, but given the context of up trend stocks, it could be something like AMST (a common abbreviation for AT&T).

Third tweet: ""eem ishares msci emerging markets company info URL $ eem $ goog $ qsii $ ua eem stocks share"". EEM is likely EEM, which stands for E视图股票，an ETF. The mention of MSCI suggests it's related to the MSCI index.

Fourth tweet: ""ews singapore ishares 52wk high URL $ ews $ ugaz $ gs $ goog ews finance nasdaq"". IES Singapore is a company with a symbol EWS, but looking at the symbols used, I'm not sure if that's relevant. The mention of 52 weeks high might indicate some trend.

Fifth tweet: ""wall street finally realizes the sum of the parts power of $ goog i showcased 5 yrs ago . look at presceient research URL"". This seems to relate to Google stock (GOOGL), which is a big tech company, and mentions something about presceient research showing positive trends over five years.

Now, I need to analyze each tweet for factors—Positive and Negative. Let's go through each one:

1. First tweet: The user is discussing technology stocks but doesn't mention any positive or negative points related to VIX directly. It seems neutral or maybe a bit of info about trends.

2. Second tweet: The user mentions tech companies and their performance, which could be positive because they're in the uptrend sector.

3. Third tweet: EEM is an ETF; the mention of MSCI might indicate it's related to emerging markets, which could have an impact on VIX. Not sure about sentiment yet.

4. Fourth tweet: IES (IES) and other companies but no explicit sentiment here—probably just listing symbols without analysis.

5. Fifth tweet: Clearly relates to Google stock with a positive outlook from presceient research, indicating confidence in the company's performance over time.

Now, combining these thoughts, VIX is a widely followed ETF tracking VIX index, which is related to S&P 400 index. The user mentions tech companies and tech trends, which could influence VIX. The fact that Google is up with positive research suggests confidence, but other factors like EEM being an emerging markets ETF might also play into it.

Since the main impact seems from Google and the upward trend in tech stocks, which can affect VIX positively. However, some tweets don't directly state anything about positive or negative sentiment towards VIX itself.

So overall, considering the trends and mentions of companies that could affect the stock price, but without explicit positive or negative statements, it's a bit ambiguous. But leaning more towards positive because of Google's positive outlook."
2015-09-25,Positive,"Alright, let me break down how I would approach this analysis for each tweet regarding the stock price impact on a company like Apple.

Starting with the first tweet, ""rt AT_USER iphone 6s hits stores amid apple growth questions : URL $ aapl $ goog $ pcln $ k"". It seems to mention that the iPhone 6S is hitting stores and relates it to Apple's growth. I know Apple makes iPhones and related software, so this could be positive because more customers might come to support Apple's products.

The second tweet mentions an IPX-100 fund asking size: ""$ fnv $ gdxj $ ebay $ goog fnv investing finance"". This is about a mutual fund investment, which generally supports the stock positively as it represents actual actions from investors in the company.

Looking at the third tweet, ""biib biogen inc . financials URL $ biib $ goog $ sso $ uco biib tradeideas invest"". Here, there's a mention of biogen, a biotech company. Since Apple and Biogen are both companies within the biopharmaceutical sector, this could be seen as a positive sign for their growth in that niche market.

The fourth tweet talks about a stock rate: ""$ lnkd $ pcln $ bidu $ googl $ goog $ nflx $ aapl $ amzn $ bac $ …"". Positive language like ""25 / month"" might suggest support or at least confidence in the stock's future performance.

Fifth tweet is about the Apple stock message on the board: ""$ aapl $ goog $ aa $ pmcb aapl investing finance"". This indicates that investors are actively tracking Apple, which can lead to more informed decisions and potentially positive price movements.

Sixth tweet mentions a note from a Norcal tech company including several companies like Google, Tesla, Microsoft. Tech sectors generally have strong growth potentials, so this could be a positive signal for the overall market and Apple's stock in particular.

Seventh tweet discusses KMI's quotes on major financials: ""$ kmi $ goog $ tlt $ vinix kmi stocks pennystocks"". While not directly related to Apple, the mention of Google's performance might suggest that both companies are performing well in a broader tech context.

Eighth tweet is about Google stock changes and class C status: ""$ goog $ eros $ feye $ fcx google stockmarket pennystocks"". A positive sentiment from Google could positively influence Apple, especially if they have overlapping products or services.

Ninth tweet talks about an ultra short-term futures for Google: ""$ uvxy $ smn $ goog $ usat uvxy stock share"". Positive language about Google's stocks might imply confidence in their future performance, which could push the overall market and Apple's stock up.

Tenth tweet mentions ProShares Ultra VIX futures for Apple: ""$ uvxy $ smn $ goog $ usat uvxy stock share"". Again, referencing Google's positive sentiment could lead to more favorable trades for Apple.

Eleventh tweet is about accessing a ticker in relation to tech giants: ""us tech giants URL $ aapl $ goog …"". Similar to previous positive tweets, this could indicate investor interest and potentially support for Apple.

Lastly, the twelfth tweet discusses major news on a few companies including Google. This could lead to increased attention and positive sentiment towards these companies, which might influence their stock price.

Overall, each tweet seems to either mention related companies that could drive Apple's growth or mentions of investing in Google or other companies with strong fundamentals. These factors all contribute positively to the overall market and company performance."
2015-09-26,Neutral,"Alright, so I have to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a given company. The user has provided six tweets, each addressing different topics related to financial terms and stock symbols. My task is to assess each tweet's sentiment towards the overall stock market.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the hashtags in the tweets, they all seem to be related to Google (GOOGL) or other tech-related stocks like NVIDIA (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), and Amazon (AMZN). So, it seems like the user is analyzing tweets around these specific stocks.

Each tweet has both positive and negative factors. My goal is to assess each one individually and then come up with an overall sentiment for the stock's performance.

Starting with tweet 1: It mentions "" Investors buy shares of Google on weakness..."" This suggests that there's positive action from investors regarding Google, even though it's seeing some weakness or maybe a dip in prices. So, I'd consider this as Positive.

Tweet 2 talks about insider selling and mentions ""class C stock."" Insider trading can influence stock price, so both positive (since it might affect investor confidence) and negative (as it could lead to speculative trades). However, without knowing the context or the direction of the sell, it's hard to say. But considering that some stocks are more volatile than others, maybe this is leaning towards Neutral because it's a general statement about insider selling.

Tweet 3 discusses a Twitter user offering a $25 monthly rate for a stock they mentioned like $lnkd. That seems like a business opportunity or maybe a deal with investors. Positive sentiment here would be the potential profit and growth from such deals, so I'll mark this as Positive.

Tweet 4 mentions ""class C stock forum."" This is another indicator of investor sentiment, especially since class C stocks can offer good returns and might drive up prices. So, Positive sentiment applies here.

Tweet 5 talks about cablevision systems and their performance on a high note. Even though it's a specific sector (maybe telecommunications), the mention of ""high"" could mean that the stock is performing well, contributing to positive sentiment towards overall tech stocks.

Tweet 6 discusses gold miners and market volatility with a bearish perspective. Gold miners are a financial institution, so this might affect the stock price negatively if there's instability in their operations or investments. The term ""market cap"" also suggests broader market conditions could impact the company.

Now, putting it all together: Positive (tweets 1,3,4), Neutral (tweet 2), and Negative (tweets 5,6). The overall sentiment isn't entirely clear because of the uncertainty in tweet 2's details. But given that some positive tweets are conflicting with others, I might lean towards a [Neutral] overall sentiment since it's not consistently positive or negative.

However, considering tweet 5 is about cablevision systems which is more specific but still a tech company, and tweet 3 deals with a specific stock deal opportunity, perhaps these are supportive. The overall market has been mixed due to various factors like inflation, economic data, and geopolitical issues. So, without knowing the broader context, it's hard to say definitively.

But for the sake of this exercise, I'll go with [Neutral] since tweet 2 is too vague and ambiguous."
2015-09-27,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out how the given tweets impact the future stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I should identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet: ""dis walt disney co . tick URL $ dis $ goog $ cqh $ uup dis share investing"". The stock symbol here is GOOG, which stands for Google. So, we're talking about Google.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one to see if they mention Google and extract their sentiment towards the company.

1. **First Tweet**: ""dis walt disney co . tick URL $ dis $ goog $ cqh $ uup dis share investing"" - This seems like a dummy tweet with no positive or negative information about Google. It's just a placeholder, so I don't think it affects anything.

2. **Second Tweet**: "" $ googl $ goog $ qcom news : ""qualcomm snapdragon inside the lg google nexus 5x … "" URL analyze : URL"" - This tweet mentions ""lg google nexus 5x"", which is the Google Nest platform, but it doesn't specifically talk about Google's performance or anything related to the stock. It seems neutral.

3. **Third Tweet**: ""mmrf mmrglobal inc . p / e ratio URL $ mmrf $ ief $ goog $ edap mmrf investing pennystocks"" - This mentions Google's P/E ratio and it looks like a company profile for MMRF, which isn't related to Google itself. So, nothing here about the stock.

4. **Fourth Tweet**: ""pxd pioneer natural resources co . dividend URL $ pxd $ ewg $ cod . l $ goog pxd share stockmarket"" - This tweet mentions PXC as a supplier and talks about dividend payments from GOOG, but it doesn't provide any information on revenue, profit, or other key factors related to the stock. It seems neutral since there's no direct positive or negative indication.

Now, combining all these tweets: none of them directly state that Google is performing well positively or negatively. Some are placeholders or discussing unrelated topics like Nest and dividend payments. Therefore, it doesn't provide enough information to determine a positive, neutral, or negative impact on the stock price."
2015-09-28,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of the company in question.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at them, tweet 1 mentions ""google,"" so that's probably GOGGL or GOOG. Wait, but some other tweets also include ""gog"" with a capital G and o without a dot, like ""gog"" in tweet 5. Hmm, maybe I should check the rest to see which one is definitely the target.

Tweets 1 through 10 all seem to be about stocks or related companies: google, syn synthetic biologics, xlv health care, pbmd, panw, at_user (though I'm not sure who this user is), pepsi cola, coke, and cocteau. So it's likely that the target stock symbol is ""gog"".

Next, for each tweet, I need to identify positive and negative factors. Let me go through them one by one.

1. ""google earns 'buy' rating from suntrust"" - This seems like a positive sentiment about Google's future earnings.
2. ""syn synthetic biologics , inc . company info URL $ syn $ goog $ csh / un.to $ mpo synth invest pennystockstasr taser intl…"" - This looks like a news feed or stock listing, but it doesn't mention anything specific about the company or its performance.
3. ""xlv health care select sector spdr bid URL $ xlv $ pvsp $ jblu $ goog xlv nasdaq nasdaq"" - Similar to tweet 2, this seems like a stock update without any positive or negative keywords related to the stock itself.
4. Same as tweet 3; again, just stock info and updates.
5. ""google : first a joint venture with twitter - is ibm next ? URL $ twtr $ goog $ googl $ ibm URL"" - Positive because Google is forming a partnership with Twitter, which could be good for future earnings.
6. ""pbmd prima biomed ltd . eod data URL $ pbmd $ acls $ v $ goog pbmd investing investing"" - This seems like a company profile or news about Pram Biowed Ltd., but not directly related to Google's stock.
7. Same as tweet 2, just stock info and updates.
8. ""AT_USER AT_USER that's hard , it's a valuation short - $ rax is completing with $ amzn $ msft $ goog who can afford to make hosting cost zero"" - This seems like a negative sentiment about the company's valuation or financial health. The mention of hosting costs might indicate issues.
9. Same as tweet 2, stock info and updates.
10. ""coke coca-cola bottling co . consolidated e . p . s . URL $ coke $ goog $ bdt.to $ syke coke pennystocks tradeideas"" - This mentions a company unrelated to Google, so maybe just stock information.

Now, for each tweet, I'll note the factors and sentiment. Most tweets are either informational or just about other companies, not directly related to Google's performance. The only positive tweet is number 5, which talks about forming a partnership with Twitter, which could be beneficial. Number 8 mentions valuations but seems negative.

Since most of the relevant information isn't specific to Google, I can't confidently assess their sentiment towards the stock. Therefore, it's likely that none of these tweets have a clear positive or negative impact on the stock price."
2015-09-29,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for the given company. The user provided a list of 17 tweets and some specific instructions on how to process them.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the tweets, it seems like all of them mention Google (GOOG), so that's our target stock symbol.

Next, for each tweet, I should separate the factors into positive and negative ones. Then assess the sentiment by evaluating how these factors might influence investor sentiment.

Starting with the first tweet: It mentions detailed benchmarks showing iPhone 6S is the fastest phone globally, focusing on $ signs and their respective stocks. I don't see any positive or negative factors here, so this seems neutral.

Moving to tweet 2, it talks about Google changing its search algorithms for mobile websites and is offering a great rate. This doesn't seem positive or negative, just an update, so probably neutral.

Tweet 3 discusses Google unveiling Nexus 6P and 5X phones, which are Android users top in the market. While it's something to do with Google's hardware line, no direct info on the stock, but it's more about hardware than the stock itself. So neutral again.

Tweet 4 is about gains from movements in assets like NVAX, AAPL, GOOG, DJIA, and US DJPY. This seems speculative and can be seen as neutral because it doesn't mention any positive or negative news related to Google's stock.

Tweet 5 is about Blackberry Q2 earnings review, focusing on software outlook and Android strategies. Again, this is more about the company's future plans rather than its current financial performance, so neutral.

Tweet 6 introduces Google introducing email-based ad targeting. While it's something Google is doing, there's no explicit mention of positive or negative impact on their stock price, just a marketing strategy. So likely neutral.

Tweet 7 mentions Apple CEO Tim Cook's privacy letter as a threat to Google. This seems like a serious threat, which could be seen as negative for Google's stock.

Tweet 8 is about NestORNAmerican tanker shipping ltd., with investor opinions from N.Y. Stock Exchange. This doesn't seem related to Google's stock; it's another company entirely, so neutral.

Tweet 9 talks about Google's Nexus phones potentially involving a project called ""Fi."" There's no direct info on the stock price impact, just an internal announcement, which is neutral.

Tweet 10 discusses JBLU and its jetblue airlines. Again, unrelated to Google, so still neutral.

Tweet 11 mentions SPDR (a stock exchange) with shares about autonomous vehicles. Not related to Google, so neutral.

Tweet 12 talks about autonomous vehicles arriving in 3 years and splitting into stages. No connection to Google, hence neutral.

Tweet 13 is about TBEV and their performance in the sector. No direct link to Google's stock, so neutral.

Tweet 14 discusses SDRL and Seadrill. Again, unrelated, so neutral.

Finally, tweet 15 talks about Sprint's summary. Not related to Google, thus neutral.

Now, looking at all these tweets, there are a few that could be considered negative (tweet 7) but the majority seem neutral or speculative. The overall sentiment seems mixed but leaning more towards neutral because while some tweets are negative, others don't directly impact the stock. Therefore, combining all factors, I would say the stock is [Neutral]."
2015-09-30,Positive,"Alright, so I'm trying to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The possible sentiments are positive, neutral, or negative. Let's go through each tweet step by step.

Starting with the first tweet: ""chatter $ goog may take stake $ gpro been saying ages with video content king makes sense for youtube or $ fb / / AT_USER AT_USER $ aapl"". It seems like the user is talking aboutGOOG possibly making money from their video content, which could be positive. They're also referencing股 price changes and other companies. I'm thinking this might be selling stock or suggesting favorable investments.

Second tweet: ""rt $ aapl hft algos broke 109.80 in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 09:34 , p / t 108.00 quant $ msft $ fb $ gpro $ amzn $ goog $ tsla $ nflx $ qqq"". Here, they're discussing stock prices of several companies and making price comparisons. The user seems concerned about the volatility but doesn't explicitly state whether these are good or bad for the stock.

Third tweet: ""[ video ] mid-week update with kay kim | $ indu $ djia $ spx $ spy $ compq $ qqq $ rut $ iwm | $ aapl $ tsla $ goog $ googl $ xlu … URL"". It's another video update, but without direct mentions of stock performance. The user is providing context about the market index and tech companies.

Fourth tweet: ""CSIQ canadian solar inc . dividend URL $ csiq $ jjc $ goog $ xlf csiq nasdaq share"". They're discussing a company with a dividend and making a purchase offer for their shares. This could be seen as positive because it's a potential investment opportunity.

Fifth tweet: ""google facing ' array ' of undisclosed sec investigations , warns probes reporter $ goog URL"". The user is talking about Google's legal situation, which might affect investor sentiment. If they're worried about security issues or regulatory actions, this could be negative.

Sixth tweet: ""see why these assets are trending in 1 watchlist greececrisis $ aapl $ eurusd $ goog $ spx URL URL"". Again, discussing market trends and potential financial impacts of the Greek crisis. This seems like it might be positive if the crisis is seen as a positive event affecting the stock.

Seventh tweet: ""google earns overweight rating from jpmorgan chase & co . ( goog ) URL"". Positive news about Google earnings would likely boost investor confidence, which could lead to positive sentiment towards the stock.

Eighth tweet: ""$ goog - nbcu reaches deal to sell ads on youtube videos , including ' tonight show ' clips URL"". This seems like a strategic move by a company to buy more ads from YouTube, possibly increasing their revenue. This is usually good for profitability and stock performance.

Ninth tweet: ""rt AT_USER google unveils everything apple launched , but cheaper : URL $ goog $ aapl"". Positive information about competitors or new products could be good news, boosting the company's outlook.

Tenth tweet: ""rt $ aapl hft algos triggered sell in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 09:22 , p / t 108.00 quant $ msft $ fb $ gpro $ amzn $ goog $ tsla $ nflx $ qqq"". Similar to tweet 10, they're talking about selling stock based on previous performance, which is a positive signal.

Eleventh tweet: ""rt $ aapl hft algos triggered sell in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 09:50 , p / t 108.00 quant $ msft $ fb $ gpro $ amzn $ goog $ tsla $ nflx $ qqq"". Same as tweet 10, just the time is slightly later.

Now, compiling all these, I notice that some tweets are positive (like Google earnings, video content ideas) while others suggest selling stock based on previous performance. It's a mix of optimism and cautious buying. But overall, the most significant positive factors seem to be Google's earnings and the video-related suggestions, which could lead to positive sentiment. However, the other tweets are indicating potential risks or concerns about stock volatility, which might lean towards negative.

Considering all these, I think the overall sentiment is leaning towards positive but with some cautious optimism. Maybe it's a moderate positive."
2015-10-01,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out the likely impact on the stock price for the company based on these tweets. Let me go through each tweet one by one and break them down.

First, in tweet 1, nest is releasing a protocol related to smart home devices. This could be good because smart home products are often in demand and might drive sales or innovation, which could positively impact the stock price.

In tweet 2, there's an insider transaction on Google by co-founder. While insiders can sometimes influence stock prices, it's not something that usually leads to a significant change. It might just add noise or maybe make investors more cautious but doesn't necessarily signal strong news.

Tweet 3 mentions Google's self-driving technology getting closer to reality. This is positive because advancements in AI and tech can boost investor confidence, especially if the company is investing heavily in these areas. A shift towards better technology could attract new customers and increase revenue, which is a good sign for stock price.

Looking at tweet 4, the user wants to see Sheryl post on $Twitter so that both Google and Apple can fight. This seems like it's setting up a potential merger or acquisition scenario between the two companies. A split bet against each other could lead to significant deals, which is a strong indicator of good news for the stock price.

Tweet 5 talks about Google's financials being in class C, which means they're seen as more stable and less risky. This could reassure investors that the company is financially sound, which would generally be positive for stock performance.

Tweet 6 is about Apple and Google leading the way to own the future. This suggests a competition to establish dominance, which might drive price competition. Companies that seek to capture market share from others often experience increased revenues or profits, though it could also lead to increased costs if they expand too much.

Now, putting this together: The tweets are mostly positive with some minor concerns. While tweet 2 is somewhat speculative, the rest show growth potential and strategic moves. Overall, these signals point towards strong fundamentals that are expected to drive stock price increases."
2015-10-02,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on TSLA's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I see the target stock is TSLA (Ticalo). Each tweet seems to be about a specific event or upgrade related to TSLA's stock. 

Looking at tweet 1: It mentions ""hft algos triggered buy in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 08:28"" and provides the stock price. This looks like a positive signal because it indicates a potential increase.

Tweet 2 talks about AT_USER providing information on GM's (gambit) stock, which could be related to TSLA, so positive sentiment here too.

Tweet 3 also mentions an upgrade from Oppenheimer, which is typically a good sign for the company. That adds another positive factor.

Tweet 4 repeats the info from tweet 2 and 3, reinforcing the same positive outlook on GM's stock.

Tweets 5-7 discuss TSLA-specific upgrades: Alphabet's upgrades to outperform GM and Google. These are strong signs of growth potential, so they contribute positively to the stock price.

Lastly, tweet 8 mentions that TSLA is being used by a billion user base. This suggests increased demand for their services, which could lead to growth, contributing to a positive sentiment overall.

Adding all these factors together—positive upgrades from Oppenheimer, GM's news, and increasing usage—it seems the overall impact is a strong positive on TSLA's stock price."
2015-10-03,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to determine the impact on the stock price based on these tweets. So, first, I need to extract the target stock symbol from all the tweets because that's essential for any analysis.

Looking at the tweets provided, they don't directly mention the company names except in some context. Let's check each one:

1. The first tweet is about ""goog"", but it seems like it's more general without a specific stock.
2. The second tweet also just lists ""google"" and others, again, no specific company mentioned.
3. The third tweet has ""$ vrng $ goog $ googl"" which might refer to Google, especially with the context of their services or products. ""Tha..."" could be slang for ""but,"" so maybe referring back to Google. 
4. The fourth tweet talks about $ gequ increasing almost 20 times and mentions subscribers, so that's definitely referencing Amazon.

So it seems like the primary companies involved here are Google (GOOG) and Amazon (AMZN). Now, I need to analyze each tweet with respect to these stocks.

Starting with the first tweet: ""google nexus , amazon , at & t ( podcast ) $ goog google …"" It mentions Google's products and their services, so positive for tech companies. The term ""nexus"" might be related to Google's ecosystem or partnerships.

The second tweet is about Google and Amazon together, specifically mentioning they're stealing a patent or idea. That could indicate either a strategic move towards acquiring another company or a partnership effort in the tech industry. Patents are often seen as positive for innovation but sometimes can be competitive if other companies are also entering the market.

The third tweet says ""rt hairy_st"" and talks about stealing an idea with few patents, making them $ goog $ googl. Again, focusing on Google's innovation and their strategic approach in product development or partnerships. This could be seen as a positive sign for growth because having innovative products can attract more customers.

Lastly, the fourth tweet is clearly about Amazon increasing significantly in value, which is positive news for Amazon and likely beneficial to its stock price.

Now, assessing each tweet:

1. ""google nexus , amazon , at & t ( podcast ) $ goog google …"" - This seems to be about Google's ecosystem and services, so positive.
2. ""google nexus , amazon , at & t ( podcast ) URL $ goog google $ googl $ amzn $ t URL"" - Combines Google with Amazon, which is a market move towards tech partnerships or acquisitions. Positive for the company in question.
3. ""rt hairy_st : $ vrng $ goog $ googl we stole and idea , few patents , made billions , grow , diversify not be obvious . tha … URL"" - Talks about stealing an idea with few patents, indicating potential strategic moves or new developments. This is positive because innovation can drive growth.
4. ""$ gequ has increased almost 20 times in value , for our subscribers ! huge news : $ erbb $ bbda $ goog"" - Clearly mentions Amazon's stock increasing significantly, so this is a strong positive.

Putting it all together: Each tweet seems to be supporting the success of Google or related companies, which typically leads to positive stock movements. All tweets are positive in nature and focus on innovation, partnerships, and growth potential. Therefore, these signals suggest that the stock price is likely going to increase."
2015-10-04,Neutral,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided four tweets and wants me to determine their impact on a company's stock price using one of three categories: Positive, Neutral, or Negative. 

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at tweet 1, it mentions ""goog $ googl"", which likely refers to Google. The other tweets involve Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and PCLN (which might be PriceChips Inc., a subsidiary of Intel). 

For each tweet, I'll separate the factors into positive and negative. Then, I'll assess the sentiment by looking at the overall tone and any notable claims or misunderstandings.

Tweet 1 talks about new media ruining Google's USA visit. It seems to express disappointment with how Google is being misrepresented or misleading. This would be a Negative sentiment as it downplays their efforts and credibility.

Tweet 2 mentions that users can access a ticker for multiple companies, suggesting a desire to hold multiple positions instead of holding individual stocks. While this indicates interest in the group, the primary action is about stock holdings, which might not directly influence future stock price unless there's an underlying trend or expected performance.

Tweets 3 and 4 are all related to ""rt stockology 101"" with mentions of financial terms like 1 money mistake. These tweets seem more philosophical or humorous, possibly aiming to engage rather than provide actionable information. Since they don't directly address technical or market factors, their impact is likely Neutral.

Putting it all together: one tweet is Negative, the others are Neutral. The overall sentiment would be a mix of negative and neutral."
2015-10-05,Positive,"Alright, let me figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided four tweets with some symbols and URLs mentioned, but I'm not sure about all details. My task is to assess each tweet's potential effect.

First, looking at tweet 1: ""m & amp; a daily : paving way for apple car ? URL $ amzn $ atcey $ avgo $ bhi $ brcm $ cam $ chs $ cvc $ exc $ fdx $ gm $ goog $ googl $ hal"". The mention of Apple's stock symbol, ""apple"", and its current symbol on Twitter seems to suggest that there might be some interest or buzz around Apple. If someone is talking about a ""paving way for apple car,"" it could imply that the company is making progress toward their product vision. However, without knowing more about what they're focusing on (like a car company), I can't be certain. It's possible positive because Apple's stock is highly valued.

Tweet 2: ""@alphabet $ goog $ googl URL ... What you need to know about alphabet $ goog $ googl URL"". The mention of ""alphabet"" and ""goog"" makes me think this could be a Twitter account related to Alphabet Inc., which is known for the Google Glass product. If the user is promoting or signaling something good, like advancements in AI or 5G technology, it might boost investor confidence. I'm leaning towards Positive here because Google Glass has been influential and can impact stock sentiment positively.

Tweet 3: ""@almostforgot ; result of last trade ( $ fb $ amzn $ goog $ nflx $ blk $ lnkd tweeted ... ) $ googl entry 661.67 closed 672 . … URL"". Here, the user is talking about a trade result and mentions ""goog"" again, possibly related to Google. If there was some confusion or miscommunication in trading results, especially if it's a positive outcome for the stock, this could influence sentiment positively as well.

Tweet 4: ""@gain from movement in these buzzing assets greekdebt $ djia $ goog $ spx $ twtr URL URL"". This tweet mentions Greek debt and other indices like DJIA (Dow Jones Industrial Average) and SPX (S&P 500). While Greek debt is a significant issue, if it's being discussed in the context of market performance or stock movements, I'm not sure. The mention of ""twtr"" could refer to Twitter stock, but without context about its performance relative to others, it's hard to assess. It might be a neutral statement since it's speculative and relates to broader market trends rather than direct stock indicators.

Putting it all together: Tweets 1 and 3 seem to hint at positive developments or discussions related to Apple and Google, which are major companies with strong stock prices. Tweet 2 is more about Alphabet Inc., which could also have a positive impact if promoting new products. Tweet 4 introduces another angle with Greek debt, which isn't directly tied to stock performance. Considering the main focus on significant tech stocks like Apple and Google, these tweets likely contribute positively to investor sentiment."
2015-10-06,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out how these tweets will impact the stock price of the company. Let me start by understanding what's given.

First, there are two tweets provided, but they both seem to be about investing or financial topics like tech stocks and exchange rates. The user wants me to analyze each tweet, determine their impact on the stock, and then decide if it's positive, neutral, or negative overall.

Starting with the first tweet: ""screen through high rated articles at once for us tech kings $ aapl $ goog $ fb URL URL"". Hmm, that seems like an ad or promotional message about investing in tech stocks. They're talking about screensharing and maybe suggesting stocks like Apple (APlp), Google (Goog), and Facebook (FB). The mention of dollars suggests they're probably talking about foreign exchange rates or international transactions.

Now, the second tweet: ""gain from movement in these buzzing assets $ eurusd $ gbpusd $ goog $ rgzpf $ usdjpy URL URL"". This looks similar to the first one but with different currency pairs. Again, it mentions trading and possibly dollars related to specific currencies like EURUSD, GBPUSD, GROZPF (which might be a typo for another currency), and USDJPY.

From what I can gather, both tweets are offering information about investing or financial products that involve trading certain assets. They might suggest buying stocks in tech companies or others listed on the stock market. The fact that they're promoting multiple assets could imply that there's interest or consideration from potential investors looking to trade these specific financial instruments.

Given that this is a company, if the tweets are offering investment advice, it could lead investors to consider whether investing is worth the risk for them. If the user is encouraging trading and stock purchases, that might indicate positive sentiment because it's talking about opportunities or strategies for success in the market.

However, I'm not entirely sure if ""gain from movement"" implies anything more specific than just information. It could be general advice rather than focusing on a particular company. But given the context of tech stocks, which are often considered by many investors as being a positive trend with growing potential, it's possible that this sentiment is positive.

But wait, both tweets mention ""for us,"" suggesting they might be targeting a specific company or group of companies. If the target company is doing well in these areas, and there's interest from potential buyers looking for investment opportunities, that could enhance their stock price. On the other hand, if it's just general advice without any specific information about the company's performance, it might not have a strong impact.

I'm also wondering about the tone of the tweets. Both seem to be positive in nature, with words like ""gain from,"" ""movement in these buzzing assets."" This could imply that they're encouraging investors to participate or take action related to those assets.

In terms of overall sentiment, if there's a lot of interest and promotion without any specific negative information, it might lean towards positive. But if there are concerns about the market performance or if the target company isn't doing well in these areas, it could be negative. However, since both tweets are focused on high-priority assets that companies often invest in, especially tech stocks which have been a bit of a hit recently, I think they might contribute to a positive sentiment.

But wait, maybe some people don't buy stocks directly and instead trade currency pairs or make other investments. If this is about trading, then it's about speculation rather than actual purchases, which could lead to negative sentiment because it involves risky trades that could lose money. However, if the focus is on suggesting strategies for success in the market, even if there are risks involved, it might still be considered positive.

I'm also thinking about the target company and its position in the market. If they're well-known tech companies, their stock may have already shown some growth, which could make this tweet more likely to boost the price. But without knowing the specific information behind these tweets, I can't say for sure.

Another angle is the use of ""URL URL"" at the end of each tweet. It might be a placeholder or an error, but it doesn't provide any additional context that would influence the sentiment negatively.

Considering all this, I think the overall sentiment is probably [Positive] because the tweets are promoting financial information and investment strategies, which can lead to investor interest and potentially higher stock prices, even if there's some risk involved. However, without more specific details about the company or its performance in these areas, it's a bit of an assumption.

I'm also considering that sometimes tweets can be misleading or based on incomplete information, but since both are offering investment advice with no negative words, I lean towards positive sentiment overall."
2015-10-07,Neutral,"Okay, let's figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of the company. The user has given me 15 tweets in total, and I need to assess each one by tweet or summarize the overall sentiment. 

First, I'll go through each tweet one by one. I need to extract the relevant information about the stock symbol and then analyze the factors mentioned. For each tweet, I have to identify positive (P) and negative (N) factors. Then, I evaluate how each factor might influence investor sentiment.

Starting with tweet 1: It mentions ""AT_USER the psychology of investing – your brain and your money URL $ dia $ spy $ qqq $ aapl $ goog $ twtr URL."" The main points here are about investing mindset and stock symbols. Since it's about strategies related to investing, this seems neutral towards specific stocks.

Tweet 2: It lists minor movements in several stocks but doesn't provide any significant news. It talks about expert opinions (%-), which might indicate some short-term analysis but not major sentiment change. So, I'll mark this as neutral.

Tweet 3 repeats the same prompt, so it's likely similar to tweet 1 and should be considered neutral again.

Tweet 4 mentions EU safety regulations and tech losers, focusing on Facebook and Google. This could suggest a downbeat view from regulators affecting the market, but without specific news about the company itself, it's probably neutral.

Tweet 5 provides more details on the same topic as tweet 4, reinforcing the idea of regulatory changes impacting the market, so again, I'll keep this neutral.

Tweet 6 talks about Alphabet Inc. and their class C news. If Alphabet is a tech company, this could indicate negative news from a major player, but without specifics on what's happening with Alphabet itself, it's hard to gauge sentiment.

Tweet 7 repeats the prompt, so same as tweet 1—neutral.

Tweet 8 says the same thing again, repeating the prompt. It's redundant and probably just reiterating the topic without new info, so neutral.

Tweet 9 is another repetition of tweet 5 about regulatory news affecting the market. So, again, neutral.

Tweets 10 to 13 are all about surface pro 4 and Microsoft. They don't provide specific stock details or relevant news related to Alphabet or other companies mentioned in the tweets. This seems too vague for sentiment analysis, so they'll likely be considered neutral.

Tweet 14 mentions that Google is downgraded by Vetr Inc., affecting their stock price. This is a specific negative event, which could indicate a potential downward trend and might have a slight negative impact on the stock.

Tweets 15 talks about Alphabet increasing its price from $760 to $790 in Wells Fargo's range. While this is positive news for Alphabet, it's a moderate increase rather than a significant one. However, since it's related to Alphabet, which is being evaluated in other tweets (like tweet 8 and 12), the sentiment might still be neutral.

Now, summarizing all these: tweets 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10-13 are about various regulatory issues or tech companies not directly related to Alphabet. Tweet 14 is a specific event that could slightly affect the stock price negatively but might be minimal compared to other factors. Tweets 12 and 15 talk about gold prices, which don't impact stock prices, so they're neutral.

Considering all this, the overall sentiment seems mixed with some negative events, but most tweets are about unrelated or minor topics. The specific event in tweet 14 might tip the balance slightly, but given that other tweets don't provide substantial news related to Alphabet's performance, it's likely a mix of positive and negative factors.

I think the overall sentiment is neutral because while there are some negative events, they're not dominant enough to outweigh the general market conditions. The stock price hasn't shown any clear trend based on these tweets."
2015-10-08,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company and decide if it's positive, neutral, or negative. The user provided a list of tweets, each with some content. Let me go through them one by one.

First, they mentioned ""rt AT_USER ..."" which usually means someone is responding to an investment tip. I think these are tips from others advising investors on their investing psychology and financial decisions. But the main goal here is to see if these tweets contribute positively or negatively to a company's stock price.

Looking at each tweet:

1. The first one mentions ""the psychology of investing – your brain and your money"" with various stocks listed. It seems like it's about general advice, but I don't know how that affects any specific stock directly.
2. Second tweet has multiple links with class C shares for Peabody Energy and the S&P 500. Again, not specific to a company.
3. Third one is repeating the first tip line, which is probably just repetition without new info.
4. Fourth tweet mentions BTU for Peabody Energy and some other stocks. No specific stock mentioned here.
5. Fifth tweet talks about CMG, fnma, goog, mcd, cmg again—another repetition but on different companies.
6. The sixth tweet says Google shares have closed up to $645.44. That's an event that would affect the stock price. If investors are seeing a rise, it could lead to an increase in demand or positive sentiment.
7. Seventh tweet repeats the first tip line again.
8. Eighth and ninth tweets mention Chrome and Microsoft as windows 10 users' preferences for browsers. Again, no specific company mentioned here.
9. Tenth tweet is another repetition of the first tip line.
10. Eleventh tweet mentions Alphabet Inc. class C summary, but again, not a specific stock.
11. Twelfth tweet discusses TD to Toronto-Dominion Bank's P/E ratio, which might affect financial performance, but not directly related to any stock listed.

So, looking at the positive tweets: only the sixth one specifically mentions Google shares. That's an event that would likely increase demand for Google stock if it hits a high. The other tweets are general tips about investing in different companies or topics without targeting a specific stock.

The overall impact seems to be on Google since the sixth tweet is the only one mentioning their stock price. If Google sees a rise in shares, especially around $645, that could lead to an increase in investor demand for the stock. Therefore, this would contribute to a positive sentiment towards the stock."
2015-10-09,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and figure out if they're positive, neutral, or negative for the stock price of some company. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

Starting with tweet 1: ""goog alphabet inc . - class c short sales URL $ goog $ xli $ ewy $ xrt goog pennystocks pennystocks."" The word 'class' is mentioned along with 'short sales.' Short sales are a financial strategy, so that's a negative thing for investors because it can reduce their investment returns. So I think this tweet is Negative.

Next, tweet 2: ""hhse hannover house , inc . last trade URL $ hhse $ goog $ qid $ ewz hhse finance nasdaq."" The word 'last trade' implies that the stock had its last market activity, which could mean it's about to change hands. It doesn't specify what it's trading for or related to anything, so I'm not sure. Maybe Neutral?

Tweet 3: ""rig transocean , inc . e . p . s . URL $ rig $ goog $ gmcr $ sd rig invest investing."" The word 'invest' is a neutral term in stock terminology and doesn't directly relate to the stock's performance. So probably Neutral.

Tweet 4: ""x news updated thursday , october 8 , 2015 11:07 : 21 pm $ gg $ tbt $ goog $ iwm URL."" The time is on October 8, 2015, which seems specific. I don't have info on whether this tweet affects the current stock performance. Maybe Neutral or Positive if it's just a recent event.

Tweet 5: ""rt AT_USER rt $ nflx hft algos broke 114.20 in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 10:19 , p / t 118.00 quant $ msft $ fb $ gpro $ amzn $ goog $ a …"" This tweet mentions NFLX, which is脸书's stock symbol. It also talks about football stats and other companies. I don't see any direct mention of the target stock or its performance. Maybe Neutral.

Tweet 6: ""rt AT_USER today is the first day that google's parent company is called alphabet . URL $ goog $ googl URL."" The tweet says Google's parent is now Alphabet, which seems like a recent statement. Alphabet is a well-known tech company with strong earnings. This could indicate good news for stock prices, so Positive.

Tweet 7: ""see why these assets are trending in 1 watchlist $ bac $ cien $ glen $ goog $ lse URL URL."" The word 'watchlist' and the names of stocks don't relate to Google's performance. So I think Neutral.

Tweet 8: ""m & a daily : paving way for apple car ? URL $ amzn $ atcey $ avgo $ bhi $ brcm $ cam $ chs $ cvc $ exc $ gm $ goog $ googl $ hal."" This tweet mentions Apple and Google. It's not directly related to the target stock, so maybe Neutral.

Now combining all these: Tweets 1 is Negative, 2 is Neutral, 3 is Neutral, 4 could be Positive or Neutral (depending on context), 5 is Neutral, 6 is Positive, 7 is Neutral, 8 is Neutral. So overall sentiment... It's mostly Neutral except for a couple of tweets that are positive about Google and Apple. I think the overall sentiment is [Neutral]."
2015-10-10,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to figure out if they're positive, neutral, or negative for the stock price of some company. The user provided three tweets and wants me to summarize their impact on the future stock price.

First, let's break down each tweet. 

The first tweet says that ""our stock alerts gained over 1,900 % in 2 and a half months ! see our special new pick : URL $ ibm $ goog $ aapl."" It seems like the user is confirming gains but it's not very specific about what they mean by ""stock alerts."" Maybe referring to something else. So, I don't think this is a strong positive or negative statement on its own.

The second tweet mentions Google CEO Pichai mentioning new sales, advertising, and Android features. That sounds like good news because Google has been making strides in tech and could boost their stock. However, it's more of an analyst update than a significant event from the company itself.

The third tweet talks about staying ahead with NASDAQ 100 analysis, views, etc., but again, without specific information on what the tweets are about, it's hard to gauge the impact on the stock price. It might be providing general news that doesn't directly relate to any particular company's performance.

Considering all these, I don't see any clear positive or negative indicators here. The first tweet is somewhat vague but not specific enough, and the others aren't directly related to a company's performance. So, combining them, it seems like there's no strong evidence of positive or negative impact."
2015-10-11,Negative,"Okay, so I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the future stock price of a company. Let me break down each step as if I'm just starting out.

First, the target stock is identified from the tweets. Looking at tweet 1: ""steve jobs : a great movie but not about the man i knew : URL $ aapl $ goog $ pcln $ k"". The stock symbols here are APEX (A) for Apple and GOOG (G). So I'm assuming the company is either Apple or Alphabet Inc.

Next, each tweet is broken down into factors. In this case, it seems to be focusing on Steve Jobs and mentioning some movies but not specifically about him. But I can still extract that the target stocks are Apple and Google because those are the obvious ones here.

Now, for sentiment analysis. The user says, ""a great movie but not about the man i knew"". Hmm, this is a bit tricky. It sounds like they're talking about movies, so maybe it's influencing investor sentiment towards either positive or negative directions regarding the movies. But since the tweets are about stocks, perhaps they're indirectly affecting people who hold these stocks.

I need to consider whether the movies being discussed (like ""The Matrix"") are related to Apple or Google. It doesn't seem like these are directly related, so maybe the tweet is more about general investing or market trends rather than specific companies.

If investors are looking at movies and not finding them helpful, that could affect their view on media consumption or content, which might in turn influence stock prices for companies that consume media. However, without knowing if this relates to either Apple or Google's business directly, it's hard to tell.

I should also think about the overall market trends. If there are general events affecting the stock market like economic downturns, company performance, or interest rates, they might impact the stock price. But here, I don't see any immediate indicators of such events.

Considering all this, since these tweets don't specify a particular stock or provide strong information about the companies, it's challenging to say for sure whether they are positive, neutral, or negative towards the company's stock. The tweet is more about discussing movies in general and their potential impact on media consumption trends rather than any specific aspect of the target stocks.

Therefore, I think it's reasonable to conclude that these tweets don't provide strong evidence to determine a clear overall sentiment for either Apple or Google. So, the sentiment remains neutral."
2015-10-12,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. The user provided seven tweets and asked me to analyze them. Let's break this down step by step.

First, each tweet has different factors that affect investor sentiment. So for each tweet, I should separate positive (P) and negative (N) factors, assess if they're positive or negative, and then determine how each tweet impacts the stock price.

Looking at the tweets:

1. $ bee seas goog: This is a blog post about trending stocks. It mentions strategic hotels & resorts, which could be positive because it's a relevant industry. So factor 1 is P.
2. rt $ nflx hft algos broke 113.50 in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 10:39 : This seems like a price update from quantconnect.com. Negative because the number of shares is decreasing, which might indicate concern about future performance.
3. goog alphabet inc . - class c shares URL: Positive because Alphabet Inc has a strong track record in technology and has high valuation potential.
4. rt AT_USER 2/2 vfsummit $ goog cfo ruth porat .. but : This tweet seems to be discussing the CFO role, which is a positive sign as it's a key leadership position and can influence the company's direction.
5. rt $ nflx hft algos broke 12:00 , p / t 108.00 quant $ msft $ fb $ gpro $ amzn $ goog $ aapl $ tsla $ qqq : Another price update from quantconnect.com, likely negative because more shares are down.
6. $ goog chromecast 2 review: Positive because it's about a product, suggesting customer satisfaction and potential growth.
7. $ bbry goog googl ... registration page: Again, positive as Google hosting services might be good for the company.

Now, I'll analyze each tweet:

1. The blog post is about trends but not directly related to the stock. Maybe neutral because it's not addressing the specific stock.
2. Price drop from 113.50 in sigma-x seems negative. So N.
3. Alphabet Inc is positive; P.
4. CFO discussion is positive, especially if it mentions leadership; P.
5. Another price dip; N.
6. Chromecast review suggests good reviews; P.
7. Registration page for Google hosting; P.

So factors are: P (1), N (2 and 5), P (3, 4, 6, 7). Now, how do these affect the overall sentiment?

There's a mix of positive and negative factors. Some are strong support from Alphabet Inc, but others indicate concern about future performance. The review for Chromecast suggests potential success.

If enough positive factors outweigh the negatives, it might be positive. Here, there are four positives (3,4,6,7) and two negatives (2,5). Maybe leaning towards positive because some positives reinforce each other, while the negative is balanced by a couple of others.

Alternatively, if the negative trends have material impact, like the price drops on 2 and 5, which both show concerns about future performance, it might pull down the stock despite some positives.

I'm not sure. It's a mix. Maybe I should look for any strong sentiment signals. The CFO discussion is positive, but the recent price changes are more concerning. The chromecast review could be a short-term improvement but without context on the company's performance, it might not predict significant future gains.

So overall sentiment isn't clear-cut; there's some support from Alphabet and positive reviews, but two negative points pull the stock down."
2015-10-13,Positive,"Alright, I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price based on the provided information.

First, looking at each tweet individually:

1. The first tweet says ""apple tv : the amazon ban won't hurt a bit"" and links to Amazon. It mentions that the ban won't hurt the company because they can continue business as usual. This seems positive about avoiding potential risks.

2. The second tweet is ""dear tim cook , amazon just banned your apple tv 4 URL $ goog $ googl $ msft $ sne $ aapl $ amzn"". Similar to the first, it mentions that the ban won't hurt Amazon since they can continue operations. So, this reinforces the positive sentiment.

3. The third tweet is ""$ goog reviews updated monday , october 12 , 2015 12:07 : 21 pm $ rwm $ ddd $ xme $ nati URL"". It updates reviews on Google but doesn't specify whether it's positive or negative. Since there's no explicit mention of Amazon here, I can't determine the sentiment from this tweet alone.

Combining all three tweets, they all talk about Amazon avoiding potential bans related to another company, Apple TV. All of these are positive statements suggesting that even if a ban were implemented, Amazon could continue operating without issues. This seems like good news for Amazon's future performance because it reduces uncertainty and risks tied to other companies.

So, considering the positive feedback from all three tweets about avoiding potential bans, the overall sentiment should be positive."
2015-10-14,Positive,"Alright, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the future stock price of Alphabet Inc. I'm not very familiar with all the details about Alphabet's current situation, so I'll have to make educated guesses based on the information provided.

First, let me look at each tweet one by one and break them down into factors and sentiment.

1. **""rt $ qqq hft algos broke 106.20 in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 10:08 , p / t 104.00 quant $ msft $ fb $ gpro $ amzn $ goog $ aapl $ tsla $ nflx""**
   - This tweet mentions the price of Alphabet and talks about market data from several financial services companies like sigma-x, crossfinder, ats, and lx. It also provides stock prices for multiple companies including Alphabet.
   - The word ""broke"" might indicate a significant event affecting the stock. Since it's in quant and talking about price breaks, this could be a positive signal suggesting a potential good news story related to Alphabet or its competitors.

2. **""europe sets off a second cloud boom and amazon will be the biggest winner URL $ aapl $ fb $ goog … URL""**
   - The tweet mentions Europe setting off a new cloud boom, which is a metaphor for economic growth. It also suggests that Amazon could be a major winner.
   - Cloud boom often relates to tech companies as they might benefit from digital transformation or automation in industries like healthcare or manufacturing. This makes me think Amazon could see significant gains here.

3. **""url <- want to make $ 600,00 in one year trading ? check out how this guy did it ! $ goog $ pcln $ vtae""**
   - The user is asking if they can make $600,00 in a year and offers guidance by mentioning the CEO of Alphabet. This seems like a promotional tweet offering advice.
   - Offering to help with investments or ideas could attract investors looking for growth opportunities. It might suggest that Alphabet is doing well and could see returns.

4. **""goog alphabet inc . - class c stock forum URL $ goog $ aem $ upro $ jnug goog stocks share""**
   - The tweet links Alphabet's stock to a community discussing Class C stocks. This could mean that investors are interested in expanding their portfolio into financials, which might indicate growth potential.
   - If they're looking for investment ideas or discussing trends related to Alphabet, it adds credibility and could drive interest.

5. **""rt AT_USER $ goog's chief biz officer ( omid kordestani ) now exec chairman of $ twtr . ( that sound you hear is the rumor mill starting u …""**
   - The user is announcing that Alphabet's Chief Business Officer has left, and this person becomes the chairman of TwTR. This might be a sign of change within Alphabet or its leadership.
   - If someone is leaving their position and new leadership replaces them, it could imply increased influence, possibly positive for Alphabet's direction.

6. **""goog alphabet inc . - class c financials URL $ goog $ drys $ jpm $ lqmt goog investing investgoogl alphabet inc . …""**
   - Similar to tweet 4, this mentions Alphabet in the context of Class C financial companies and includes investment links. It suggests a focus on expanding into financial sector, which could be good for growth.
   - If these are considered financials, Alphabet might see gains from diversifying or acquiring new businesses there.

Putting it all together, each tweet points towards Alphabet having strong fundamentals, economic indicators (like cloud boom), and positive investor sentiment. The promotional offer in tweet 3 also suggests they're a solid company with growth potential. The announcements about leadership change (tweets 1 and 5) might indicate stability or expansion in their operations.

Considering all these factors—alphabet's current fundamentals, the overall market conditions indicated by economic indicators like cloud boom, and positive investment discusses—it seems Alphabet is poised for some positive developments."
2015-10-15,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and figure out their impact on the stock price of Alphabet Inc., also known as Google. Let me break down what each tweet is saying.

Starting with the first tweet: ""goog alphabet inc . - class c yield URL $ goog $ jdst $ algn $ swks google stockmarket nasdaq"". It seems to mention Google's class C yield and their stock ticker. This might be related to corporate finance, which usually doesn't directly affect investor sentiment much.

The second tweet is ""why apple still leads in mobile devices over Microsoft and Google URL $ aapl $ goog $ googl $ msft"". Here, the user is comparing competitors in the mobile device market. Apple is often ahead in this space, but it's more about business strategy than short-term stock price changes. I don't see anything here that would influence Google directly.

Third tweet: ""goog alphabet inc . - class c ex-div date URL $ goog $ goog $ yinn $ agn goog share stocks"". The term ""ex-divide"" is a bit technical, but it seems to be related to corporate events affecting stock prices. While this could impact investor sentiment, it's more about company news than specific stock performance.

Fourth tweet: ""AT_USER when are the momo stk people going to realize today that the p / a in $ nflx reflects the rest , , last qtr . $ fb $ amzn $ goog"". This tweet is referring to financial metrics for NFLX, Amazon, and Google. The mention of P/A ratios could indicate their valuation relative to other companies but doesn't directly affect the stock price of Google.

Fifth tweet: ""$ 71,000 in one trade ! ! by following their signals more info here URL .. $ amzn $ mcox $ goog"". It mentions a trade worth $71k and follows company signals. More information here could mean they're expanding or increasing their market reach, which might suggest growth but doesn't directly affect Google's stock.

Sixth tweet: ""rdus royal gold , inc . eod data URL $ rdus $ tza $ pmpix $ goog rdus finance stocks"". This is about Royal Gold & International Finance. Their financial performance could influence investor sentiment if they're a major competitor or have strong fundamentals, but it's not related to Google.

Seventh tweet: ""xlu health care select sector spdr market cap URL $ xlu $ pot $ mmm $ goog xlu nasdaq nasdaq"". Discusses health care stocks and the S&P 500. Health care is a significant industry, but unless there are specific developments, it's not directly affecting Google.

Eighth tweet: ""entrance to the dining room . $ alphabet $ nasdaq $ goog"" seems like a casual message from a customer asking about Google's NASDAQ stock. This could just be an informational post and might not have any impact on the stock price.

Ninth tweet: ""rt AT_USER rt to win - bigdata crowdfunding $ fb $ ym $ nq $ es $ goog $ googl $ aapl $ tsla $ gld $ mnst $ msft $ qqq $ hgu fintech drones..."" More information about bigdata and crowdfunding. This could relate to the company's products or market trends, but again, it doesn't directly affect Google's stock price.

After reviewing all these tweets, none of them seem to provide direct information that would significantly influence Google's stock price. Most are either discussing business strategies, financial metrics unrelated to Google, or informational posts without any positive or negative connotations. So, considering the overall sentiment, I'd say it's neutral."
2015-10-16,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether these tweets are going to have a positive, neutral, or negative impact on the stock price of pypl.

First, looking at tweet 1: It mentions ""pypl reynolds american inc."" So maybe it's talking about something about that company. The rest of the tweets list various factors like volume URL, exchange rates for $ pypl and others, but then a direct quote from reynolds saying $ ha $ fdx $ goog. Hmm, not sure what those terms mean here.

Then tweet 2 mentions insider selling at google with 5,056 shares. Insider transactions usually can affect stock prices because they might influence investor sentiment. If there's more buying or less selling, it could lead to a positive trend.

But I'm not entirely sure about the other tweets in tweet 1. They mention exchange rates and names like pypl, but without specific information on how those relate to pypl itself, it's hard to assess their impact. So, considering the insider transaction is significant, maybe it will have some positive effect, but the rest are unclear.

Putting it all together, there might be an outlier in tweet 1, and tweet 2 is a strong negative indicator due to insider selling. Without clear information from tweet 1, I'll lean towards overall negative sentiment."
2015-10-17,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company, specifically Apple Inc. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol mentioned in the tweets: it's ""A."" That stands for Apple Inc., which is a key indicator that we're analyzing the stock's performance based on the sentiment related to Apple.

Now, let's go through each tweet one by one. 

The first tweet says: ""why access a ticker when you could acesss a group of tickers - us tech giants URL $ aapl $ goog $ msft $ fb $ twtr."" Hmm, this seems like a generic request for information about accessing multiple stocks related to tech giants. It doesn't mention any positive or negative factors directly but seems more like an offer or suggestion. I'm not sure how this affects the stock price yet.

The second tweet is: ""$ goog - running on empty URL"" followed by some emojis and mentions of GHTC and other companies, with a mix of happy and upset expressions. This looks pretty positive because it's talking about being excited about a company called GHTC (GHTC) and listing the companies and their ticker symbols. The use of emojis like 🎉 and 💸 suggests excitement or interest in the stock. 

Wait, but I need to focus on Apple Inc., not just any tech giant. So the mention of ""goog"" isn't specific enough because ""goog"" is an acronym for Google. Maybe it's just a typo or extra information, so perhaps that tweet doesn't have a direct impact on Apple's stock.

Putting this together: the first tweet is about accessing other tickers related to tech companies, which could be seen as a way to gather information but not necessarily impacting Apple's price directly. The second tweet seems more like an announcement with some positive emotions, which might indicate investor interest or excitement around GHTC, but again, it's a bit vague and doesn't specifically target Apple Inc.

So overall, neither of these tweets seems to have a clear positive or negative impact on Apple's stock. It's mostly about gathering information from other companies and expressing feelings without any concrete action that would affect the price. Therefore, I'd say this is a neutral sentiment."
2015-10-18,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided four tweets and instructed me to use a scoring system with [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, let's understand what each part means. Each tweet is separated by ""rt AT_USER"" followed by some factors. It looks like they're trying to gauge sentiment based on recent events or trends related to the stock.

Looking at tweet 1: It mentions that analysts love AP, GOO, PCLN, and K stocks. I think this could be positive because being loved in the tech space is often a good sign for investors. But I'm not entirely sure if it's always indicative of good news or just how the market seems to react.

Tweet 2 also talks about the mobile industry changing quickly, mentioning AP, GO, MSFT, and RIMM. The fact that these companies are being mentioned in tech tweets could be a positive sign because moving into new sectors often leads to growth and higher stock prices. Plus, AP is known for its financial performance, so this might boost confidence.

Tweet 3 repeats the same points as tweet 2, just with different sector names. It's similar to previous ones, suggesting consistent optimism about the industry's evolution.

Tweet 4 mentions Dupont co., investing shares, and links it to stock prices of AP, GO, WOOF, and DIAR. I'm less sure about this one. Dupont is a financials company, but without more context on how their business is doing, it's hard to tell if it's positive or negative.

Tweet 5 again talks about the mobile industry changing quickly, similar to tweets 2 and 3. Again, being in tech could mean good investment sentiment. It reinforces the idea that current trends are positive for the stock.

Putting this together: Tweets 1, 2, 3, and 5 all highlight the fast-paced changes in certain industries like mobile, which can be seen as a positive sign if these sectors perform well. However, tweet 4 has more of a financial sector focus without clear industry trend indicators. Since most tweets are about tech or mobile changing rapidly, it's likely indicating a good outlook for the stock.

So overall, considering all four tweets, they seem to suggest that the current trends and changes in industries like mobile and technology are favorable, which would be positive for the stock price."
2015-10-19,Missing,File not found
2015-10-20,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of the given company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First tweet: ""gain from movement in these buzzing assets ftse 100 $ goog $ ibm $ tsla url"". It mentions the FTSE 100 and specific stocks, which might be related to broader market trends but doesn't provide immediate information about the company's financial performance.

Second tweet: "" outsiders missed the political logic of pharma's [r & d] spending ' --> could be true for $ goog , $ amzn , $ msft . eventually $ fb"". This seems to mention potential upcoming stock price movements based on current trends. It hints at future performance and doesn't have a clear positive or negative implication.

Third tweet: ""vr is coming fast . nyt partners with $ goog to mail a million cardboard viewers along with a vr article : url"". This sounds like a promotional social media post, which can boost investor interest and possibly increase stock price due to increased visibility.

Fourth tweet: ""$ dpm $ frak $ goog"" – I think there's an issue here. It might refer to a typo or error in some data related to Google, but it doesn't provide financial information about the company itself.

Fifth tweet: ""google's growing problem : 50% of people do zero searches per day on mobile url via at_user $ goog mobile search"". This suggests that consumer behavior is declining, possibly impacting sales. It could lead to negative sentiment towards Google and related stocks.

Sixth tweet: ""$ goog's growing problem: 50% of people do zero searches per day on mobile url via at_user $ goog mobile search"". Similar to the fifth tweet, indicating a trend where mobile users aren't searching for Google services much. This might indicate competition or other factors affecting the market indirectly.

Now, compiling these thoughts: The third tweet is about social media promotional activity which could be seen as positive by boosting investor interest. However, the fourth and sixth tweets are about issues with search behavior, which might lead to negative sentiment. The first tweet mentions broader market movements but doesn't provide direct financial info. The second tweet suggests potential future trends. 

Putting it all together: Promotional social media posts can be seen as positive by increasing visibility and user engagement. However, the data related to mobile searches indicates a trend that might affect competition or consumer behavior, leading to potential negative sentiment towards Google. This mix of positive and negative signals could result in an overall negative impact on stock price."
2015-10-21,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out the best way to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on stock prices. The user provided three tweets, each addressing different companies and factors affecting their stock performance.

First, I need to identify the target stocks mentioned in the tweets. From the first tweet, it seems like ""signs flashing technologies"" is the stock symbol. The second tweet mentions ""youtube,"" but since the user didn't specify the stock symbols for YouTube or Gpt Inc., I'll assume that's another target stock. The third tweet talks about a new Nexus phone from AT_USER, which might be a typo and refers to ""Apple Watch""? Hmm, not sure about that.

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate the factors into positive (P) and negative (N). Let me go through them one by one.

1. The first tweet says ""signs flashing technologies are sinking in Q3!"" which gives a negative signal about the company's performance. It also mentions staying focused with a closed price of FB at $97.80. So, I think this tweet is negative because it's projecting bad news for the stock.

2. The second tweet introduces YouTube launching an ad-free service and music streaming URL. YouTube is known for its content generation and ad revenue, so this could be positive. However, since there's no mention of a specific company or stock price change, I'm not sure about the impact on the overall stock, but given the context, it might have a slight positive effect.

3. The third tweet says ""rt AT_USER new Nexus phones come with lte-advanced - mobile android."" If ""AT_USER"" refers to Apple Watch, then this could be positive because Apple has been investing in gadgets for their fitness wear. However, without specific company names or stock prices, it's hard to assess the impact on a particular stock. Maybe just neutral if not providing significant information.

Now, assessing each tweet's sentiment:

- The first tweet is strongly negative because it's projecting that the signs are going bad, affecting Q3 performance.
- The second tweet is slightly positive because YouTube is a major player in content and ad revenue, which can support growth but without a specific stock reference, I'm not sure about the overall impact on any given company.
- The third tweet is neutral or maybe even positive if considering Apple's focus, but again, without context, it's speculative.

Considering all these factors, the first tweet has a clear negative sentiment. The others are either partial or speculative. So, when combining the sentiments, the overall impact seems to be negative because one of the tweets strongly indicates bad news."
2015-10-22,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for the given company. The user provided a list of tweets, and I need to assess each one step by step.

First, I'll start by identifying the target stock from each tweet. It seems like most tweets mention either Google (GOOG) or Amazon (AMZN), so those are my targets.

Starting with the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER q3 2015 $ goog $ googl $ amzn earnings conference calls today ( video ) URL google amazon investors."" This clearly mentions Google and Amazon, which I think refers to AMZN. The user is saying that Google's earnings were expected in Q3 of 2015 and they'll be hosting a conference call. This could influence investor sentiment positively as it shows confidence about their performance.

Next, ""i'm investing in the wrong companies ... wtf $ goog $ googl $ amzn URL."" The mention here of AMZN indicates that the user is not invested there, so this might be pointing towards negative sentiment because they're choosing not to invest in the right company. It suggests a lack of diversification.

""rt AT_USER google's first earnings as alphabet : here's everything you need to know URL $ goog URL."" This tweet is very positive about Google's earnings and mentions Alphabet (GOOGL). If Alphabet has strong growth potential, especially if it aligns with their core business goals, this could be a positive sign.

Then there's ""rt AT_USER amazon + 12 % alphabet +10.5 %Microsoft +5% $ amzn $ goog $ googl $ msft"" where the user is suggesting that Amazon (AMZN) is increasing in price due to Alphabet's performance. If Alphabet is expected to do well, this could push AMZN up.

The third tweet says ""rt AT_USER congrats bulls . 6 months of taking it in the bottom paid off finally . $ fb $ goog $ googl $ msft $ aapl $ amzn tonight we celebrate …"" The user seems to be encouraging investors to celebrate and mentions AMZN again. They might be signaling a positive outlook, which could boost the stock.

""The next tweet is ""everything that ’ t google in alphabet is now ' other bets ” hm . $ goog"" where the user is reminding investors not to invest only in Google but to bet on Alphabet instead. This sounds negative because it's pushing away from a strong company and suggests diversification, which could decrease investor sentiment.

""rt AT_USER $ amzn is all like ... and then $ goog is all like ... URL"" this seems similar to the previous one, reinforcing that AMZN might do well alongside Google.

The tweet ""ah gainers $ msft $ goog $ amzn"" is straightforward; it's listing positive gains for Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. Positive price movements usually indicate good news, which would be a positive sentiment.

Next, ""rt AT_USER $ goog : the newest member of the half a trillion dollar club that makes two . URL"" suggests that Alphabet might be adding another big contributor to their revenue pool, which could be seen as a positive sign for their growth prospects.

In tweet 14: "" Signal Twitter en $ goog - URL URL"" appears to be an indicator or link, possibly related to Google's stock price movement. It might indicate a buy intention or expectation of positive news, contributing to the overall positive sentiment.

Then there are more tweets discussing earnings and other factors. ""rt AT_USER q3 2015 $ goog $ googl $ amzn earnings conference calls today ( video ) URL google amazon investors"" again about Google's Q3 earnings. If it's confirmed that they will be called, the user might be signaling confidence in their performance.

Finally, a list of EMA and stock market indicators pointing towards positive trends for AMZN, suggesting good demand or expected growth which would contribute to a positive stock price.

Putting it all together, I notice some tweets are talking about Google's earnings, while others mention Alphabet. If Alphabet is expected to do well in the near term, that could positively impact AMZN's stock. The user also mentions betting on Alphabet's success, which might drive AMZN up. However, there are negative tweets warning not to invest only in Google but instead in other sectors, which can be seen as a diversification move, possibly reducing sentiment.

The overall trend seems positive because many tweets highlight the expected growth of companies related to Google and Alphabet, with some encouraging diversification away from strong performers. The list of gains for Microsoft, Google, and Amazon also supports a positive outlook. Therefore, despite some negative remarks about not only Google but also other sectors, the core themes are about expecting growth in key players."
2015-10-23,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the overall impact of these tweets on the stock price of the given company. The target stock is [GOOGLE]. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

Starting with tweet 1: "" $ goog : analyst action by cowen & company on alphabet : URL URL"". Hmm, that looks like a placeholder or a link to an analyst's report. I'm not sure what the analyst said, but since it's from a competitor company (Cowen & Company), maybe they're suggesting some positive action. But without knowing the details, it's hard to assess.

Moving on to tweet 2: "" more on google : $ 5b buyback launched , youtube / mobile discussed on call URL $ goog $ googl URL"". This seems to be about a buyback for Google. Buybacks can sometimes decrease stock price if investors prefer other opportunities. But I don't know the context here.

Tweet 3 is similar: "" $ goog $ googl google ( alphabet ) subía ayer un 10 % en a / h tras presentar estos resultados : URL URL"". Again, this mentions a 10% increase but without knowing if it's positive or negative for the stock. Maybe it's a bit of a bump, but not sure yet.

Tweet 4: "" chart : tech sector outperforming ( even before the $ goog , $ amzn , $ msft results ) - URL"". If all major tech companies are outperforming, maybe Google is still in a good spot. However, tech generally faces competition, so this could be mixed.

Tweet 5 and 6: They're both ""rt AT_USER china drops rates , amazon drops a profit - markets go wild ! $ aapl $ amzn $ goog $ msft $ qqq"". So multiple tweets from the same user. The quotes mention China dropping rates and Amazon profits, which can affect stock prices. If the sentiment is mixed—maybe some positive mentions of Amazon's profit but also potential uncertainty in China rates—this could have an overall negative impact.

Tweet 7: ""rt AT_USER china drops rates , amazon drops a profit - markets go wild ! $ aapl $ amzn $ goog $ msft $ qqq - - URL htt …"". Similar to tweets 5 and 6, multiple mentions of profit from Amazon and potential Chinese rate developments. It's possible the sentiment is consistent negative here.

Tweet 8: "" $ p notes selling out local ad inventory - key view acq tgt $ fb or $ goog - with whole package taken new dimension by AT_USER $ socl $ spy"". The user is selling inventory, which could be a positive signal about future growth. Also mentions Alphabet's stock and some other companies. This might indicate positive sentiment towards the tech sector.

Tweet 9: "" $ twtr , $ aapl , $ mu , $ mnk , $ goog , $ msft , $ amzn"" — these are all stock ticker symbols, not providing specific information about Google. So probably irrelevant for this analysis.

Tweets 10-25 are similar to tweet 7 and 8, with multiple mentions of profit from Amazon or other tech companies. They seem to be reinforcing the idea that the tech sector is strong, which could boost Google's stock price.

Putting it all together: There are several tweets talking about profits from Amazon, possible rate changes in China, selling inventory, etc. While some are positive (like selling inventory and potential tech success), others are more speculative or negative due to rate changes and uncertainty. However, the majority of the tweets point towards a favorable outlook for the tech sector, which would likely boost Google's stock price.

So overall sentiment is positive because multiple factors are pointing in the same direction—积极的市场表现和对科技行业的乐观态度。"
2015-10-24,Positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price of Alphabet Inc. based on the given information. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at each tweet individually and identifying if they mention Alphabet's stock symbol. The first tweet mentions ""goog alphabet inc .,"" which is clear—it's Alphabet's stock symbol. So, that seems important.

Next, I need to separate the tweets into positive and negative factors. Each positive tweet reinforces a positive outlook, while negatives indicate potential issues or concerns. But some tweets are a bit unclear in their wording, like ""dhi dr horton inc . current price"" which doesn't clearly mention Alphabet. That might make it harder to assess the sentiment.

For Sentiment Analysis: I'll look at each tweet's content. The first one talks about investors' expectations and believes in Alphabet's future performance. It mentions the stock URL and mentions other companies, which suggests investor confidence. 

The second tweet from Goldman Sachs reinforces their buy rating for Google, indicating positive sentiment for Alphabet. The third is similar, reinforcing another positive rating.

The fourth tweet introduces ETFs like EMAC TO and discusses investing. While it doesn't specify a direction, it might be more of a general statement about the company's investments rather than specific news impacting Alphabet's performance.

The fifth tweet gives an analyst rating that’s neutral for Alphabet, suggesting that their opinion isn’t strong enough to change investor views positively or negatively.

The sixth tweet updates opinions on IBM and other stocks but doesn't mention Alphabet at all. This could imply that the sentiment isn't tied directly to Alphabet, so it might not significantly impact the stock price.

The seventh tweet mentions DHI and current stock prices for Alphabet, similar to the first one. It seems like a general statement about the company's stock without specific details on performance or concerns.

Lastly, the eighth tweet talks about YouTube subscriptions and Alphabet's presence in media but again doesn't mention Alphabet itself beyond its mention of ""alphabet inc."" This is important because it might suggest broader industry trends affecting the stock indirectly.

Now, considering all these tweets: The first tweet has a strong positive tone towards Alphabet. The other tweets either reinforce that sentiment or don't provide specific info about Alphabet's performance. So overall, the information suggests Alphabet is well-rewarded and investors are optimistic.

Therefore, combining these factors, the overall sentiment seems positive."
2015-10-25,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets regarding Google's stock price impact. So, first, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at them:

1. $ goog - it's now easier than ever to shop on facebook URL.
2. $ goog - URL daily round up 10/23 / 15 : thc , acat , veev , opk URL
3. $ goog : analyst action by nomura on alphabet : URL URL
4. $ goog - google price target increased to $ 830.00 by analysts at needham & company llc goog URL
5. $ goog - google wants to use drones too , but not in the same way as amazon URL

The common thread here is that all tweets mention Google, so I think it's safe to conclude that the target stock is ""Google"". 

Next, for each tweet, I need to identify Positive and Negative factors. Let me go through them one by one.

1. ""It's now easier than ever to shop on Facebook URL."" Hmm, this seems like a neutral statement because it doesn't indicate any positive or negative action regarding Google itself. It's more about accessibility of Facebook. So, I'll mark this as Neutral.

2. ""$ goog - daily round up 10/23 / 15 : thc , acat , veev , opk URL."" This is also a bit vague and doesn't provide much information on Google's actions or trends related to its stock. It seems like it could be about products or services, but without more context, I can't say for sure. So, I'll mark this as Neutral.

3. ""Analyst action by nomura on alphabet : URL."" The term ""alphabet"" is a typo; likely referring to Google. This tweet mentions that analysts at Nomura are talking about Alphabet (Google) and its URL. It doesn't mention anything related to the stock price, so again, it's a neutral statement.

4. ""$ goog - price target increased to $ 830.00 by analysts at needham & company llc."" This clearly states that Google's price target has been set at $830.00. That should increase investor interest in the stock, which is positive.

5. ""$ goog - wants to use drones too , but not in the same way as amazon."" Again, it seems like this tweet is discussing Google's plans for using drones, possibly for something like self-driving cars or other tech. However, it doesn't mention anything about the stock price being up or down; it just talks about their approach. So, I'll mark this as Neutral.

Now, summarizing the factors:

-neutral
-neutral
neutral
positive
neutral

When combining these, the positive tweet has a big impact because it's directly affecting investors' expectations and potentially driving the stock price up. The other neutral tweets don't have enough information to sway the overall sentiment significantly. So, the overall sentiment should be Positive.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the third tweet. Let me double-check that. It mentions Alphabet (Google) talking about URL, which doesn't relate to their actual stock price. So, it's definitely neutral there. The fourth is the only one with a clear positive statement, so it should dominate the overall sentiment.

Yes, I think Positive is the right conclusion."
2015-10-26,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to analyze these tweets and figure out if they're going to impact the stock price positively, neutrally, or negatively for a given company. The user has already provided a detailed process with steps 1 through 8 and an output requirement of choosing between [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, I need to extract the target stock from each tweet. Let's go through them one by one.

1. ""Our penny stock pick on $ gequ is up 2,757 . 14 % for our platinum members ! subscribe today : URL $ cbl $ goog $ bll"" - Hmm, this tweet mentions a penny stock called gequ, which might be Gece (Gece), but the price increase seems like it could positively affect the stock. The mention of platinum members and subscription suggests customer engagement or updates.

2. ""Google : still the one $ goog URL"" - This seems to indicate that Google is doing well with a positive URL signal. It might be showing confidence in their performance, which can boost investor confidence.

3. ""Uttiledate analysis on $ aapl $ amzn $ axp $ baba $ cvx $ fb $ ibm $ mon $ xom $ msft $ goog $ ym_f $ es_f $ nq_f $ cl_f URL"" - This is a list of company names with their stock symbols and some of them are known to be leading companies, like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN). The fact that there's analysis on these could indicate support from investors, which might positively impact the stock.

4. ""rt AT_USER prepare for backing , filling and the fed URL ibdnews via AT_USER $ goog $ amzn $ msft $ vrx"" - The mention of preparing to back Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Visa (VWX) along with the Fed could be a positive sign, as these companies are in various sectors that might drive stock prices.

5. ""rt AT_USER google's mobile contribution to revenue grows - $ goog URL"" - If Google is growing its mobile revenue, it can boost overall revenue, which often leads to better performance and higher stock prices. This sounds like a positive factor.

6. ""rt AT_USER facebook ․ com and google ․ com are the most visited sites on the planet . in other news , $ fb and $ goog stocks are today both at all …"" - Facebook and Google's increasing presence on the web can drive company sales and user engagement, which might positively affect their stock prices.

7. ""$ goog - twitter inc . finally lends a hand to advertisers URL"" - The mention of Twitter helping with advertisers could be good for brand visibility or ad revenue, which is often a factor in stock performance.

8. ""rt AT_USER chase takes aim at apple , google with new mobile payments service : $ aapl $ goog $ pcln $ k"" - The introduction of a new mobile payments service targeting Apple and Google shows investment in their future products, which can attract more customers or investors, potentially boosting the stocks.

Now, considering all these tweets, each mentions positive developments related to companies that could impact their stock prices. The fact that there's increasing interest in specific sectors like Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Google, and Twitter suggests that the overall sentiment is positive."
2015-10-27,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of the target company. The user mentioned the tweet symbols but didn't specify which company. Since this is a prompt for general analysis, I'll pick a common stock as an example, like Apple (AAPL), and go through each tweet.

Looking at tweet 1: It mentions Facebook's and Google's websites are popular, and it talks about their stocks being high. That seems positive because both companies are well-known, so investors might be encouraged to buy shares.

 Tweet 2: It looks like someone is promoting Apple and Google articles they rated highly. The links might redirect them towards tech stocks, which could boost investor confidence in tech firms.

Tweet 3: Discusses the apple watch industry being affected by a Swiss watch industry. This suggests an upward trend, making the stock more attractive as it's gaining traction in a competitive market.

 Tweet 4: Talks about a shipping and trading company, which is a different sector. While it might have some positive aspects, unless there's specific info that affects the target company, this tweet could be neutral or even negative if the company isn't affected by its performance in other sectors.

Tweet 5: Mentions a stock pick up 3,085% for platinum members and encourages subscription. High returns can boost investor interest, making the stock more likely to rise.

Putting it all together, most tweets are positive about specific companies or trends that could positively influence their performance. The overall sentiment seems mixed but leans towards positive because multiple factors are pointing in a good direction. However, tweet 4 is a bit of a detour and doesn't directly relate to the target company, so maybe it's neutral."
2015-10-28,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets and figure out their impact on the stock price of the given company, which is probably Microsoft. Let's go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. The most common one here is ""msft"" in some of them. So the target stock is Microsoft.

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. Positive factors are probably words that indicate a good outcome or increase, like ""hft"", which might mean higher trading volume or confidence. Negative factors could be more negative terms like ""sell"".

Looking at tweet 1: It says ""rt $ twtr hft algos triggered sell in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 13:24 , p / t 24.00 quant..."" I'm not sure about the exact meaning of these abbreviations, but it's talking about selling stocks because of hft and algos. So this is negative.

Tweet 2 follows the same structure as tweet 1, so another negative impact on selling.

Tweet 3 also uses ""hft"" again, leading to sell, so continues the trend towards negative sentiment.

Tweet 4 mentions a sell signal but then talks about breaking into a stock quote. That might indicate that some people are still concerned or waiting for more information before buying.

Tweet 5 repeats the sell trigger from tweet 1-3 and also breaks in another stock. So this reinforces the negative sentiment further.

Now, looking at other tweets: Tweet 6 is about an ETF related to homebuilders, not Microsoft. Tweet 7 talks about investor opinions and the Google/MSFT relationship on a specific day. Tweet 8 says that Aapl made a buy decision using hft algorithms, which could imply that there was some positive news for MSFT, maybe good news because APLX is part of MSFT's stock.

Tweet 9 just mentions Google's URL, not directly related to Microsoft unless the user is referring to their stock. Tweet 10 talks about evaluating high-rated tech king articles and screening them, which might suggest that others found good investment opportunities for MSFT.

Putting this together: The tweets from 1-5 are all negative calls to sell due to hft algorithms or卖出 signals, but tweet 8 says Aapl used hft to buy. Since APLX is a component of MSFT, the positive action could mean they saw value and decided to invest. However, other tweets mention selling more stocks, which might indicate concern that buying another stock is causing negative reactions elsewhere.

The mix of both selling signals (negative) and a buy decision with hft algorithms (positive but for a related stock) makes it ambiguous. If APLX's actions were based on positive indicators, it could be a good move for MSFT, but the other tweets are still pushing for sell, which might affect the overall sentiment.

Considering all this, there seems to be some conflicting signals: both negative and positive factors. It's hard to tell if the combined impact is positive or neutral because some tweets push in one direction and others indicate concern about selling multiple stocks."
2015-10-29,Neutral,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user has provided 15 tweets, but I need to extract just enough information from them to assess the sentiment towards a specific stock.

First, I'll identify which tweet contains the target stock symbol. Looking at the tweets, none seem to mention a specific stock yet. That's a problem because I can't extract the stock symbol without more context or the exact line of text that includes it. Without knowing what stock we're talking about, it's hard to assess the market impact.

Since I don't have information on which company is being referred to in these tweets, I might end up with incomplete data or incorrect conclusions about whether each tweet affects a particular stock. This could lead to misjudging the overall sentiment of any given stock because I can't connect the information from the tweets to a real-world company.

I should probably ask for more details on which company's stock these tweets are referring to, so I can analyze their impact correctly. Without this, it's challenging to determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative towards that specific stock."
2015-10-30,Negative,"Alright, I need to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company based on the given information. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. The companies mentioned are Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet Inc., and others like Meta and Tesla. Each tweet includes mentions of these companies or their related products/competitors.

Starting with the first tweet: ""google plans to merge android , chrome os into single os - hmm , URL $ goog $ msft $ google $ googl … … … … … URL"". The main points here are Google's merger plan and possible stock price movements. The mention of a potential URL suggests that there could be some sort of stock news or updates, which would likely affect the stock price positively.

Next tweet: ""facebook ( fb ) , alphabet inc ( goog ) start war to collect the unconnected $ fb $ goog URL"". This looks like a serious political move by two major companies. If this leads to a trade war or conflict, it could have negative implications for both companies' sales and profits, thereby negatively affecting their stock prices.

The third tweet is: ""goog alphabet inc . company info URL $ goog $ sea $ ugaz $ amba goog finance share"". Here, Google is being sold as shares. This is a typical buyback event, which generally boosts the stock price positively because it increases ownership without selling stock.

Fourth tweet mentions Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Apple, making a positive statement about his work. While this could encourage investors to see more good news, it might not have a significant enough positive impact on the overall market or specific company's performance to determine a strong [Positive] or neutral conclusion.

Fifth tweet: ""wsj : google plans to merge android , chrome os into single os URL $ goog , $ msft , $ googl androi … URL"". Similar to the first, Google is involved in a merger. If there's optimism about this deal, it could boost the stock price positively. The mention of ""androi"" might be a typo for ROI or return on investment.

Sixth tweet: ""rt AT_USER aapl apple , inc . 52wk high URL $ aapl $ goog $ nrz $ intc aapl stocks tradeideas"". This looks like a social media post encouraging trading ideas. It's more about providing information and fostering discussion rather than directly impacting the stock price.

Seventh tweet: ""rt $ lnkd hft algos triggered buy in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 08:17 , p / t 265.00 quant $ msft $ fb $ nflx $ goog $ tsla $ amzn $ aapl $ qqq"". The mention of buying in other companies (like Meta, Tesla) suggests that investors are taking positions in related or competitor stocks, which could increase demand and possibly boost the overall stock price.

Eighth tweet: ""rt AT_USER china drops rates , amazon drops a profit - markets go wild ! $ aapl $ amzn $ goog $ msft $ qqq - - URL htt …"". While this mentions policy changes and company profits, it's more about domestic issues rather than external factors affecting the stock price directly. The sentiment here might be positive if there are concerns about inflation or economic conditions that could impact consumer spending.

Now, combining all these thoughts: The first tweet suggests potential stock news with a URL link, which is unusual but possible. The second tweet talks about a real-world event (trade war) which can have both negative and uncertain impacts depending on the outcome. The third tweet is about buybacks, which are generally positive for the stock price. The fourth tweet might have mixed effects if Pichai's performance positively influences Apple. The fifth tweet relates to Google's merger plans. The sixth tweet is more about information sharing. The seventh tweet indicates a focus on other companies but could influence investor sentiment. The eighth tweet discusses domestic economic issues.

Considering all the factors, while there are some positive points like buybacks and merges, the broader context includes potential trade war, market reactions to policy changes, and external events that might not be as directly influencing the stock price. However, given the strong buyback offer in the third tweet, which is a direct way for Google's shares to rise, it likely has a positive impact on their stock price.

So, despite some uncertainty from other tweets, the main positive signal comes from the buybacks and potential external events."
2015-10-31,Positive,"Alright, let me break down how I approached analyzing these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of Google.

First, I identified each tweet and extracted the target stock symbol from them. The primary stock mentioned is Google (GOOGL).

Next, for each tweet, I separated them into positive and negative factors. Positive factors are things that support the stock's performance or increase investor confidence, while negative factors are those that decrease investor sentiment.

Looking at the tweets one by one:

1. The first tweet mentions Google making comments about being open to a $50 partnership. This seems like a neutral factor as it's general but positive since it's related to potential business moves.
   
2. The second tweet lists various stock charts, which are always a good sign for investor sentiment and can boost confidence.

3. The third tweet talks about Google needing to transition to desktop success. Transitioning from mobile to desktop is a common IT issue that might affect product performance, which could be a negative factor if it impacts user satisfaction or business operations.

4. Similar to the third tweet, this one mentionsIAIA and deception attacks affecting investor opinions. This sounds like a negative sentiment factor as it's speculative and potentially misleading information.

5. Another tweet about Sundar Pichai's call seems positive because company executives are often seen as reliable and can influence investor sentiment positively.

6. The same executive update as in tweet 5, reinforcing the positive outlook from Sundar Pichai.

7. Yet another executive news tweet, which is consistent with positive sentiments around Sundar Pichai.

8. The same as tweet 4; it's speculative and could add to negative sentiment due to potential misinformation.

9. This one talks about stock performance in a few months. Positive factors since it's showing growth potential for the stock.

10. Similar to tweets 5-8, reinforcing positive news from Sundar Pichai.

11. Finally, this tweet highlights Google's stock gains and introduces a new pick. The positive context of rising stock prices is crucial for investors looking to buy.

Now, assessing each tweet:

Positive factors: 1 (neutral), 2 (good), 5 (positive), 6 (positive), 9 (good from company), 10 (positive). These are overall positive but include some speculative elements which could be negative.

Negative factors: 3 and 8. Speculative information about product issues and potential misinformation, respectively, which can impact investor sentiment negatively.

Considering the overall picture after analyzing all tweets, while there are some negative factors, the positive ones dominate. The stock's recent gains in value indicate optimism from stakeholders and investors, but the speculative content in two tweets might slightly sway the sentiment.

I thought about whether to lean more towards positive or neutral because there were both supportive and speculative elements. However, the overall trend of rising stock prices suggests a positive outlook despite possible underlying issues. Therefore, I concluded that the impact is mostly positive."
2015-11-01,Neutral,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on stock price. The user provided three tweets and wants me to determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative towards a company's future stock price.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Let's see:

1. The first tweet mentions ""us tech giants URL $ aapl $ goog $ msft $ fb $ twtr"". Hmm, not sure what these are. Maybe they're abbreviations or something else. But since it's about investing in certain stocks like Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Facebook (FB), and Twitter (TWTR). So the target stock might be one of these, but without more context, I can't be certain.

2. The second tweet talks about $ gequ having increased almost 20 times in value for our subscribers. Wait, ""gequ"" isn't a stock symbol I recognize. Maybe it's a typo or an acronym. Also, the user mentions $ cbl and $ bll, which are not familiar to me either.

3. The third tweet says financials updated Sunday, November 1, 2015, at 1:59 pm, with prices for Google (GOOG), Edzard (EDZ), Microsoft (MSFT), and Xerox (XLB). So again, target stocks are there, but without knowing what these stand for.

Now, the user's output requirement is to conclude with a single line saying [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Since all tweets mention specific stock symbols from tech giants like Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, and Edzard. However, I can't identify the target company because some abbreviations are unclear.

Considering that all tweets are about financial news regarding these stocks, but without knowing which one is the target company or if they're related to a specific industry or sector, it's challenging to assess their impact on the stock price of a particular company. 

I might assume they're unrelated unless there's context missing in the tweet. Therefore, I'm inclined to consider them neutral because we don't have enough information about the company's performance or financial health.

So, my conclusion would be [Neutral]."
2015-11-02,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to figure out their impact on the stock price of the company. Let's go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet talks about transaction costs and spread betting, which might affect trading fees but not necessarily sentiment.
2. The second tweet is a sell press for Google shares, so that's a direct negative sentiment.
3. Third tweet mentions buying Google stock as part of their business plan, which adds to the positive outlook.
4. Fourth tweet extends the business vision beyond technology, focusing on business growth, which suggests potential positive news.
5. The fifth tweet reports another rise in price, another positive point.
6. This one is a bit confusing with multiple URLs and mentions Sony's anniversary. It's speculative but seems neutral because of the unknown event.
7. The sixth tweet talks about drone deliveries as a tech advantage, which could be seen as positive.
8. Another speculative tweet about interest rates in foreign markets, which might not have an immediate impact on Google.
9. The seventh tweet mentions YouTube and alphabet struggling, possibly affecting their market position but still considered neutral.
10. The eighth tweet is bullish for Facebook and its stock exchanges, adding to the overall positive trend.
11. The ninth tweet talks about Google's YouTube video facing a war with itself, which could cause negative emotions in the tech sector.

Now, let's combine these factors: some tweets are clearly positive (points 3,4,5,7), one is neutral (6), others mix up positive and negative elements. However, the overall trend seems positive due to consistent positive tweets outweighing the speculative ones."
2015-11-03,Positive,"Okay, so I have to figure out the likely impact on the stock price of a company based on these tweets. Let me start by breaking down each tweet and analyzing its factors.

1. **Extracting the Target Stock**: The first step is to identify which stock symbol is mentioned in the tweets. Looking through all 24 tweets, I see ""goog"" appearing multiple times. So the target stock is Google (GOOGL).

2. ** Tweet-by-Tweet Analysis**:
   - Each tweet can be categorized into Positive or Negative factors based on sentiment.
   - The Sentiment Factor: This is how much of the tweet indicates positive or negative feelings towards the stock.

3. **Assessing Sentiment for Each Tweet**:
   -Tweet 1 and 6 are "" rt URL ... stocks URL … ……"" which don't provide specific information about stock performance, so I can ignore them.
   - Tweets 2 mentions ""10 things in advertising you need to know today"" – this seems neutral as it's more of a list of topics rather than any impact on the stock.

   Let me go through each relevant tweet:

   - **Tweet 3**: Discusses TSLA, YOMF, indu, etc. It says Tesla is ""no longer overbought and buy it!"" So this indicates an enthusiastic expectation for the stock to rise.
   
   - **Tweet 4**: Talks about YouTube monetization through product review videos – a positive sign of potential growth or interest in their service.
   
   - **Tweet 5**: Google's e-mail bot will respond. This is a proactive business move, potentially encouraging investors, but doesn't directly impact the stock price unless it leads to demand.

   - **Tweet 7**: Google services are set for return to China, which could affect market dynamics if they expect consumer spending in that region.

   - **Tweet 8 and 9**: Both mention ""rufus cuff,"" suggesting a negative sentiment as it's about replacing or enhancing a product feature.
   
   - **Tweet 10**: Similar to 7, mentions Google services going back to China – another expected change affecting market conditions.
   
   - **Tweet 12-24**: Similar structure; mentions tech giants, which is positive for the stock.

4. **Overall Sentiment Summary**:
   - The tweets are a mix of general views and specific product changes or trends in tech companies.
   - Positive tweets include TSLA's purchase intention, YouTube's monetization, Google's business move, and market shifts due to China's consumer spending.
   - Negative tweets include Google services being returned home, the rufus cuff idea, and some unrelated mentions.

5. **Conclusion**: Considering multiple positive factors like potential growth in tech trends, new business developments, and market movements towards certain products, it seems likely that the stock will experience a positive impact. Therefore, I should conclude with ""[Positive]"" as the overall sentiment."
2015-11-04,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether each tweet is positive, negative, or neutral. Let me take them one by one.

1. The first tweet says $ goog $ googl with two amazing stats from Alphabet's Q3 earnings. That sounds like a lot of good news for Alphabet, so that should be positive.

2. The second tweet mentions Sol Capital Management holding top 10 in Q3 2015 on the Google stock. That suggests they're getting good stock prices, which is generally positive for investors.

3. The third tweet talks about stock market overvaluation with various companies like $ spy, $ aapl, etc., and it's using proven statistics. Overvalued means investors think these stocks are more expensive than they really are, so negative.

4. The fourth tweet mentions Google firing someone and discussing the company. This can be seen as negative because people might feel concerned about their job losses.

5. The fifth tweet is about Google starting delivering packages by drone in 2017. That's a positive news for delivery services and growth, so positive sentiment.

6-8: All these tweets are talking about Facebook's value compared to Google, Apple, and Amazon. These are all valuations; it's generally neutral because it depends on expectations rather than actual performance.

9: The tweet is about the Alibaba 2Q16 results, which I'm not familiar with but since it's an ongoing company, this could be positive or negative depending on the details.

10-13: Similar to tweets 6-8, they're talking about stock market valuations. So neutral again.

14: Discussing how Apple can beat Microsoft with businesses URL. This is a positive outlook for Apple, so positive.

15: Another tweet about overvalued stocks. Positive sentiment.

16 and 17: Statements about Google's efforts to reach the next 1 billion and stock market valuations. These are all neutral because they don't have specific details or data points.

Adding up: The majority of these tweets are positive, mostly on Alphabet, Facebook, and Apple. Some mixed with overvalued (negatives) but overall leaning positive."
2015-11-05,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user provided a set of tweets and asked me to determine their likely impact on a company's stock price with options [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Scanning through the tweets, it seems most of them are about Google (GOOGL) or related companies like Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), and others. 

For each tweet, I should separate into Positive and Negative factors based on the content. For example, a tweet mentioning that stock prices are overvalued can be labeled as positive for that factor. Then, assess the sentiment by looking at words like ""rise,"" ""fall,"" ""up,"" ""down,"" or evaluating if the information is speculative or news.

Looking at the tweets:

1. The first tweet mentions stock market valuations and various stocks but doesn't specify a direction, so it's neutral.
2. Second tweet talks about Android One returning to India, which could affect Apple's performance, leaning positive.
3. Third tweet relates to Google app updates, suggesting possible gains for Apple or Google.
4. Fourth tweet has stats like S&P 500 index values and changes, showing a specific trend but not sentiment.
5. Fifth tweet discusses the tech watch industry, which might be seen as a distraction but could have some positive impact.
6. Sixth tweet talks about business tech, implying potential growth for Google.
7. Seventh tweet is about ADwords availability, possibly affecting AdTech companies but not directly the target.
8. Eighth tweet mentions Alphabet's earnings report, likely indicating positive news for Apple.
9. Ninth and tenth tweets show price fluctuations of GOOGL andgoogl, showing a trend in value which is positive for investors.
10. Tenth tweet lists S&P 500 stocks by market cap, not sentiment.
11. Twilio posts related to Google's search ads, which might influence Apple or Google but not directly the target.
12. A tweet about an update on an iPhone from Apple, likely positive for Apple stock.

Now, compiling these, most tweets are either positive (like Apple earnings, Google valuations) or neutral (like market cap rankings). The information tends to show a general trend in favor of positive sentiment. Therefore, the overall impact is expected to be positive."
2015-11-06,Positive,"Okay, I need to figure out how the given tweets affect the stock price of a company. Let me start by looking at each tweet and breaking them down step by step.

First, the target stock is determined from the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER stock market overvalued..."" So, it's about AT_USER stock.

Next, I'll go through each relevant tweet to identify factors as positive or negative. Each tweet has factors related to different companies like spy, qqq, aapl, googl, etc. But since my target is AT_USER, I'll focus on the ones that mention their performance.

Looking at tweet 1: It says stock market overvalued with several companies mentioned. This could mean investors are cautious or think the stock might not perform well, so it's negative.

Tweet 2 talks about Google updating Android for work and promises free nexus. This is a positive sign because new tech products can boost a company's performance, which usually translates to higher stock prices. So this is positive.

Tweet 3 mentions unemployment rates in the US being very low since George W Bush era. Wall Street is known for its reaction to economic data, especially when unemployment drops. Low unemployment can create job opportunities and confidence, so it might be positive for investors.

Tweet 4 discusses tech stocks like NVDA, AMZN, GOOGL, ATVI. These are tech companies with strong earnings potentials. If the tweets are about them, this could indicate a positive trend or at least supportive news. So again, positive sentiment.

Tweet 5 talks about Alphabet's stock closing record high each day of the week. Companies that perform well on such days can attract attention and drive stock prices. This is another positive sign.

Tweet 6 mentions TSLA (Tessla) offering shares through a company called Stss. It seems like they're expanding, which could indicate growth and higher demand. That's positive for investors.

Tweet 7 discusses Alphabet Inc.'s earnings with a focus on their product profitability and trade ideas. This is about the company's financial health, which can affect stock prices. Positive factors here might boost the overall sentiment.

Tweet 8 repeats tweet 1, so it reinforces the negative opinion from earlier.

Tweet 9 talks about Alphabet (Aplya) targeting Apple's performance with chips. If their product advancements could benefit both companies, this is a positive sign for investors involved in both stocks.

Now, combining all these, I see several tweets that are positive and a couple that are negative. However, the dominant positive trends across multiple platforms like Wall Street, tech earnings, and company growth seem to dominate the sentiment. So overall, it's likely a positive impact on the stock price."
2015-11-07,Positive,"Okay, so I need to determine whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative in terms of their impact on a company's stock price. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet says, ""rt AT_USER stock market overvalued - proven statistics URL $ dia $ spy $ qqq $ aapl $ goog $ twtr $ nflx $ tsla URL."" It mentions that the stock is overvalued and talks about various stocks like spy, qqq, aapl, goog, etc. This seems to be providing information that could influence investor confidence. Over valuing can sometimes encourage buying, so this might be positive.

2. The second tweet is ""goog alphabet inc . - class c last trade URL $ goog $ c $ gdx $ amgn goog invest invest."" It's talking about Alphabet's stock and mentions that it's in class c with a last trade. This could mean the stock is trading at a premium, which might be seen as overvalued but also could attract investors looking for growth opportunities. Maybe positive sentiment here.

3. The third tweet is ""apple isn't going to buy sirius xm : URL $ aapl $ goog $ pcln $ k."" It's suggesting Apple won't purchase Sirius XM, which is part of the technology sector. This could impact investor sentiment by signaling uncertainty about the company, maybe causing fear and negative sentiment.

4. The fourth tweet says ""ddd 3d systems corp . chart URL $ ddd $ goog $ tlt $ uup ddd investing investing."" It mentions DDD's stock but talks about Alphabet, which is in class c with a last trade. This might be indicating growth potential, so positive impact on sentiment.

5. The fifth tweet is ""rt tradewithjoe : winning bracket trade . $ googl $ goog URL URL … URL."" It seems to be talking about a trading strategy and mentions Google's stock. Winning brackets often attract winners, which can increase investor confidence, making this positive.

6. The sixth tweet repeats the first one: ""rt AT_USER stock market overvalued - proven statistics URL $ dia $ spy $ qqq $ aapl $ goog $ twtr $ nflx $ tsla URL."" Similar to the first tweet, it's confirming the stock's overvaluation and listing multiple stocks.

Now, I'll summarize. The majority of tweets are talking about the stock being overvalued or mentioning multiple stocks in class c with last trades. This could encourage investors to buy more, especially if the performance looks good. However, some tweets talk about potential losses from Apple buying Sirius XM, which might be a risk factor. But overall, the positive statements about overvaluation and growth suggest a positive sentiment.

Putting it all together, the overall impact seems positive but with some uncertainty."
2015-11-08,Positive,"Alright, I'm going to analyze these tweets and determine their likely impact on the stock price of the company in question. The goal is to assess whether each tweet positively affects the stock, keeps it neutral, or negatively impacts it.

First, looking at each tweet individually:

1. **dust velocityshares 3x inverse crude etn stock message board URL $ dust $ kmi $ ctrp $ goog dust share pennystocks**  
   This seems to be a marketing promotion or product announcement. Promotions usually attract investors and can boost sentiment positively.

2. **$ goog received a new alert . find out why at URL stocks daytrading trading mkt nyse nasdaq markets 39**  
   A new alert might indicate improved confidence in the stock, which could lead to more positive sentiment overall.

3. **$ googl $ goog $ fb : pinterest sharpens its visual-search skills : URL URL URL**  
   The mention of improving visual-search skills is a technical advancement that can be seen as an innovation, potentially attracting new investors and improving stock performance.

4. **. AT_USER AT_USER update could soon add family sharing and gifting $ goog URL URL**  
   The tweet suggests that the user will add features related to family sharing and gifting. If this feature is relevant or beneficial for pennystocks, it might positively impact the stock price by providing value.

5. **$ goog - 3 things you never knew about the internet URL**  
   This statement is a bit vague but mentions the internet's capabilities. Such a statement can be both positive and neutral; it depends on whether it aligns with the company's product line or strategy.

6. **$ googl $ goog $ fb : pinterest sharpens its visual-search skills : URL melbourne … … … URL**  
   Similar to tweet 3, this is another technical advancement in visual search technology. Such innovations often attract new investors and improve market trends.

Considering each tweet's potential impact:

1. Promotional messages usually boost investor confidence.
2. New alerts or updates can indicate improved security, safety, or other factors that benefit the stock.
3. Technological advancements or product features can provide value to users and attract new investors.
4. The tweet suggests adding specific features to the stock, which could justify further investment.
5. Technical insights might align with market trends but are not directly about the company, so sentiment is uncertain.
6. Again, a tech-related advancement indicating improved services.

However, some tweets like #fibolab and others mention technology that if relevant, can attract specific investor interest. But without knowing the exact products or services these tweets target, it's hard to be certain. However, overall, the positive indicators from these tweets suggest a potential positive impact on the stock price."
2015-11-09,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a given company. Let's go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet mentions shorting a stake in Nikos with an 9.2% passive stake and talks about being squeezed hard. This seems like negative news because it suggests that the company might face issues or reductions in its shares, which can hurt the stock price negatively.
   
2. The second tweet talks about American top tech companies founded by immigrants on both sides of the gender spectrum. While this is positive information for some investors looking at diversity, it's not specific enough to indicate a clear trend towards the stock. It's more of a general announcement rather than specific news about the company's performance.

3. The third tweet mentions that Google will launch something called 'Project Wing' and mentions their future services with Apple Inc. This seems like a positive sign for investors since it highlights Google's plans, which can boost demand and improve stock value. However, if other companies in this space are affected by the same news, it might cause some volatility.

4. The fourth tweet talks about Facebook expanding to take on Twitter and alphabet. This is significant because it shows that Facebook has a broader reach, which could positively influence its stock price as more people use their platforms. It's a positive factor for the company.

5. The fifth tweet mentions mxl, but there's no specific information given. It simply states the ticker symbol and some other words. Without context or details about what mxl does, it's hard to assess the sentiment here. It might be neutral or just plain uninformative.

6. The sixth tweet reports positive sentiment scores for Google, a significant movement up in points, and mentions NASDAQ indices like SPY (S&P 500) and NDX (National Discount Stock). Positive scores usually indicate investor confidence, which can lead to rising stock prices. This could be a strong indicator of positive sentiment.

7. The seventh tweet introduces Mellanox as a high-growth company with good value. While this is specific information about Mellanox, it doesn't directly relate to the main company being analyzed here. However, if Mellanox's success has ripple effects on the market, it could influence the stock price negatively or positively depending on how other sectors react.

8. The eighth tweet talks about Apple releasing a new 4-inch iPhone, which is a significant announcement in tech. Tech companies often see positive trends as their products get better and more popular, so this would likely boost the stock price positively.

9. The ninth tweet mentions Google's visual-search skills from Pinterest, which could be a buzzword but doesn't give specific information about the company's performance or news related to it. It might not significantly impact the stock price unless there are external factors affecting demand for their services.

10. The tenth tweet discusses Apple's watch making efforts to reduce the Swiss watch industry. This is another tech-related announcement, which could be positive if it indicates growth in the watch sector, thereby improving the company's market position and stock value.

Now, compiling all these thoughts: negative factors from tweets 1 and 5; generally positive from tweets 2,4,6,8,9,10; and some specific positive information from 7. However, tweet 3 has high visual-search skills which is a bit vague but could be seen as a positive indicator of growth.

Considering all the factors, while there are negative points, several tweets offer clear positive signs that could tip the stock price positively. Therefore, overall sentiment seems positive."
2015-11-10,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze the given tweets to determine their impact on the future stock price of a company. The user provided four tweets and an example output which is [Positive]. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, let's extract the target stock from each tweet. 

1. ""in search of alpha-trading on limited investor attention URL goog $ googl … url"" – This doesn't specify a particular stock, so I can't identify it yet.
2. ""take a look at the top stock picks of this multi-billion dollar fund wsh , ecl , adi , fis , goog url"" – No clear stock name here.
3. ""alot of chatrooms are afraid to play the big board stocks like amzn goog googl pcln but in awesomecalls its url"" – Again, no specific stock mentioned.
4. ""stitchy's video numbers are exploding fortunemagazine videomarketing facebook fb goog url"" – No stock identified here either.

Since none of the tweets identify a specific stock, I can't assess their impact directly on that company. Without knowing which stock is being referred to in each tweet, it's impossible to determine if the sentiment is positive, neutral, or negative for any particular stock.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I don't have enough data to conclude the overall sentiment of any stock. The user should provide more details about which stock each tweet refers to so that I can accurately assess their impact."
2015-11-11,Positive,"Okay, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a given company. Let me start by identifying the target stock symbol. Looking at the tweets, it's ""GOOG"", which stands for Google. So, we're focusing on GOOG.

Now, going through each tweet one by one:

1. The first tweet mentions companies like BUD, TAP, MOJ, etc., but nothing specific to GOOG. It talks about early movers and stock prices, which could be related to GOOG.
2. Second tweet says our pick on GEQ gained over 3500% in 4 months. This seems positive because it's a high percentage gain, suggesting strong performance.
3. Third tweet mentions NOC NGR Corp, but nothing about GOOG here.
4. Fourth tweet talks about the service making significant gains last month. Maybe indicating positive trends that could impact stock prices of companies relying on this service.
5. Fifth tweet mentions Google's total debt and defends it. This is a negative sign because high debt can be a red flag for investors, especially if the company isn't managing cash flows well.
6. Sixth tweet states China shares are struggling ahead of new data. Chinese data might have negative impacts on global stock markets, but I'm not sure how this affects GOOG specifically unless it's related to a product or technology in the US or Europe.
7. Seventh tweet says Google's stock has been up since October 4th. That's positive news for GOOG, which could boost other companies that rely on its services.
8. Eighth tweet mentions NASDAQ 100 stocks trending based on specific company data. This is speculative and might not directly impact GOOG unless it's a related sector.

Now, assessing each tweet:

- The second tweet has a very high positive percentage gain (3500%). High gains can be a strong indicator of positive sentiment.
- The fifth tweet talks about Google's debt, which is generally negative but could still have some positive aspects if the company's cash position improves. However, high debt without revenue might not necessarily improve stock price unless there are other factors like innovation or growth in products.
- The seventh tweet suggests positive news for GOOG since a certain date, which adds credibility to their performance and could be seen as a positive signal.

Considering all these tweets, the strong positive percentage gain (second tweet) seems like a dominant factor. High gains are usually seen as positive by investors because it indicates strong fundamentals. Even though some other tweets mention concerns about debt or data from China, those might have a more minor impact on GOOG's stock price unless there's significant news related to their products or services.

So, putting it all together, the overall sentiment seems positive despite some less obvious concerns. The main driver here is the high gain percentage in one tweet."
2015-11-12,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price. I'm just starting out, so I'll take it step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. It looks like some of them mention ""goog,"" others have different symbols like ""aapl."" Since most tweets are related to Google's stock, I think I should focus on that one because it seems more likely.

Now, looking at tweet 1: It mentions a trade gain and includes links. The words "" gps $ goog $ nspr $ goog"" suggest excitement about Google's growth or something positive. That could be a good sign for investors.

Tweet 2 is a bit confusing with all the terms like ""lnkd stawk,"" but I think it's referring to Google and other companies. It seems like someone is moving their position in this market, which might indicate optimism.

Tweet 3 talks about Apple (aapl), Amazon (amzn), and Facebook (fb). The mention of a URL suggests they're making moves on these stocks as well. This could affect investor sentiment because moving positions can be seen as positive or negative depending on context.

Tweet 4 mentions LinkedIn buying Quora, which doesn't directly relate to Google, but maybe it's unrelated or part of a broader trend.

Tweet 5 is about Alphabet (alphabet) building smartphones beyond the current model. Since Alphabet isn't listed in the tweets, I'm not sure how relevant that is. Maybe this is a distraction or unrelated info.

Tweet 6 is about Google and other companies, similar to tweet 2. It seems like someone is moving their position again, which might be a sign of strength or optimism among investors.

Putting it all together, each tweet mentions Google in some way—either directly with ""goog"" or indirectly through other terms. The positive mentions and potential movements could indicate that the stock is gaining momentum. Investors are moving positions to take advantage of growth opportunities, which usually leads to a positive sentiment for the stock price."
2015-11-13,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of Alphabet Inc. (GOOG). Let me go through each tweet one by one and see how they might affect investors.

Starting with the first tweet: ""why police pulled over a google self-driving car and issued no ticket URL $ goog"". Hmm, this seems like a positive sign because it's talking about something the company is doing to comply or maybe improving safety. More regulations often encourage investments, so that could be good for GOOG.

Second tweet: ""URL < <-- supertrades could buy a freakin house with this recent win ! ! $ mbly $ aapl $ jcp $ tasr $ goog"". This looks like a joke because the user is calling out Facebook (FB) and probably others. Jokes can sometimes come from bad intentions, so I'm not sure about the positive or negative impact here.

Third tweet: ""rt benzinga : youtube introduces new music app ; prominent media analyst responds $ goog $ googl $ p … URL"". This seems like a positive tweet because it's talking about innovation and media influencing tech. More people looking into new apps could drive growth, which is good for GOOG.

Fourth tweet: ""alphabet inc ’ s google ( goog ) takes a page from apple ( aapl ) URL $ goog $ googl … … … … … … URL"". This looks like a positive sign since it's comparing Alphabet with Apple, both of which are major tech companies. Comparing products can encourage investors to see if GOOG is following suit.

Fifth tweet: "" $ evdy $ goog $ googl : investors disappointed in everyday health : URL URL URL"". The user is talking about investor sentiment regarding health trends. If people are disengaged or upset with health issues, that could be negative for GOOG because health concerns can deter investment. But sometimes when consumers worry about something, they might drive demand even if it's a problem.

Sixth tweet: ""rt AT_USER apple cancelling beats music subscriptions : $ aapl $ goog $ pcln $ k"". This seems like support for Apple (AAPL) as the user is canceling their beats and looking into music subscriptions. Similar to the second tweet, this could be seen as a negative because it's harming another company. But sometimes social media can create buzz that doesn't always correlate with positive actions.

Seventh tweet: ""AT_USER AT_USER this is no longer a chatter ! once $ goog writes a check to $ sune we will see a quick recovery to around $ 7 +"". This seems very positive because it's suggesting they're coming back and looking for a quick reward. Positive news can attract investors, which usually means a rise in stock price.

Eighth tweet: "" $ evdy $ goog $ googl : investors disappointed in everyday health : URL URL URL"". Similar to the fifth tweet, this is talking about investor sentiment on health trends. If people are disengaged with health issues, it could be negative for GOOG because they might drive away investment.

Ninth tweet: ""$ goog - meet the next members of alphabet inc's billion user club"" — no details here, but if it mentions something that encourages more users or adoption, that would be positive. Maybe SEO efforts are in place to increase visibility, which can boost sales and stock price.

Tenth tweet: ""$ evdy $ goog $ googl : investors disappointed in everyday health : URL URL URL"". Again, similar to the fifth and eighth tweets, this is about investor sentiment on health, which could have a negative impact if people feel disengaged or worried.

Now, summarizing all these tweets. The first is positive due to safety measures, third is positive innovation, fourth is positive product comparison, fifth might be neutral because it depends on the user's view of health, seventh is definitely positive about coming back and seeking rewards, ninth could be positive if they're using SEO or similar tactics.

However, the second, sixth, eighth tweets are more negative due to jokes that suggest criticism or harming another company. So overall, the positive tweets outnumber the negative ones. The stock might have a slight positive impact because of these supportive tweets, but other factors like health trends and social media reactions could play a bigger role."
2015-11-14,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price for the given company. The company is ""goog alphabet inc."" Let me start by extracting their symbol. Hmm, looking at tweet 1, it's 'goog alphabet inc .', so that means goog_alphabet Inc., which is GGTC. I'll use this as my target.

Next, I need to go through each tweet one by one and analyze them. 

Starting with tweet 1: ""goog alphabet inc . summary URL $ goog $ eum $ eqlb $ baba goog invest invest"". Hmm, the text mentions investing in GOOG. It talks about VR, but maybe that's a tangent. The price symbols are $ goog, which is $5000, and some other currencies like eqlb and baba, I think those might be stock tickers. It seems to promote investment, so positive.

Tweet 2: ""3 tips on designing for vr , from google URL vr $ goog"". This tweet talks about VR design tips and mentions Google with a price symbol. Again, it's promoting investment in GOOG. Positive sentiment here too.

Tweet 3: ""- class c market cap URL $ goog $ regn $ hznp $ ome goog stock investing"". It ends with ""investing"" and mentions Google again, so positive. Also, they're discussing a class C company and their market cap. So, strong positive impact.

Tweet 4: ""kite kite pharma , inc . stock message board URL $ kite $ uwti $ goog $ mcd kite finance investing"". This one is talking about KITE KITAK MAH PHARMACEUTIKA forinc. The company in question is GOOG, and they mention investing in finance. Positive sentiment again.

So all four tweets are promoting investment in GOOG or related to their stock market. There's a lot of encouragement about investing here. No negative mentions, just positive words. 

Putting it all together, each tweet reinforces the idea that investors should watch GOOG. So the overall impact is very positive."
2015-11-15,Neutral,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price. First, I need to look at each tweet separately and identify the factors contributing to its impact.

The first tweet is about wanting to make $600k in a year trading and mentions several stocks like GOOG, PCLN, VTAE. The user is encouraging investors to follow Satish Kumar on Twitter. Hmm, I don't have enough information about Satish Kumar's background or his expertise, so it's hard to judge the sentiment here. But since he's a financial expert often seen on Twitter, maybe some investors are looking for guidance, which could be positive.

The second tweet is an RTDM (Right-to-Do-More) message from Satish_kumar. It seems like he's offering advice or making an offer, so I'm not sure if that's positive or negative. The mention of YouTube and mentioning the world sounds a bit vague, but since it's a financial tip, maybe there's some sentiment towards expert opinions.

For the overall analysis, both tweets are encouraging people to follow Satish Kumar and suggest doing their research on several companies. However, without specific details about his background or the quality of his advice, I can't be certain if these are positive, neutral, or negative influences. It might not have a clear direction in sentiment."
2015-11-16,Neutral,"Okay, let me analyze these tweets to figure out their impact on the stock price of BHP. 

First, I'll look for the stock symbol they're targeting, which is ""bhp"". Then, each tweet is either a factor or an event related to bhp's performance.

I see that some tweets mention positive factors like major terrorist attacks and major growth companies. But others talk about negative things, such as video services getting less attention from teens and BHP's earnings. 

Looking at the events: TSLA gained significantly, which is a positive sign. However, there are comments about BHP facing losses in their post-earnings period, which could indicate a negative sentiment for them.

The overall sentiment seems mixed because some tweets highlight positive aspects of other companies like AI or social media platforms, but others suggest problems with BHP's performance. So, it's not clear if the positive factors outweigh the negatives."
2015-11-17,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on stock prices for the company based on the given criteria. The task is to evaluate each tweet's factors and assess the sentiment.

First, looking at tweet 1: It mentions ibb biotech and various stocks, but it seems more like a positive sign with 'trvn $ goog $ mcd' which suggests potential growth or earnings. So this could be positive.

Tweet 2 talks about AT_USER discussing the law of attraction inspiring stock trades. That's a bit vague, so I'll consider it neutral because the message is not clear or directly related to the stock.

Tweet 3 mentions a weighted equal volume fund on Google with minor context. It just says 'equal weighted $ fang still up 1 % on the day ...', which doesn't provide enough info about GOOG's performance. So, I'll mark this as neutral.

Tweet 4 is about Alphabet Inc., mentioning NASDAQ and in a nutshell statement. This seems to focus on their stock performance and could indicate positive sentiment based on the company name and the context provided.

Tweet 5 discusses copx global and copper miners with volume. This is more about an unrelated sector, so it's likely not affecting GOOG directly, making this neutral.

Tweet 6 talks about $ goog reviews updating, which might be a selling point or just market update, but without specific details on GOOG's performance, it's considered neutral.

Finally, tweet 7 mentions GOOG's max pain and previous close. Since GOOG is the company in question, knowing its max price could indicate potential overvaluation. The mention of previous close and maturities might suggest a positive trend as investors are concerned about the stock's value against history. So, this should be positive.

Combining all these, tweet 1 is positive, others are neutral or have varying sentiment which affects overall analysis."
2015-11-18,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price for a given company, in this case, TSLA (Tina, Inc.). Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock. The stock symbol seems to be TSLA because it's mentioned as ""Tina, Inc."" or maybe ""TSLA"" is the full name without the first letter. Wait, actually, looking back at the list, the first tweet mentions ""tla twap hft algo for 11-17- 15 , t / s sell quant $ msft $ goog $ gpro $ fb $ aapl $ nflx $ amzn $ qqq URL."" Hmm, that doesn't seem to identify TSLA. Maybe the user made a typo or perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, in the output requirement, the user specifies ""conclude with a single line stating the overall sentiment"" and the example given was [Positive]. But since the target stock is TSLA, maybe it's a typo? Or perhaps all tweets are related to different stocks. Hmm, that might be confusing.

Wait, looking again at the output requirement: It says ""the likely impact on the future stock price of a given company."" So I'm assuming we're focusing on one specific stock, probably TSLA. But in the provided tweets, none mention TSLA except perhaps in the first tweet where it's mentioned as ""aapl"" which is Apple Inc. Wait, no, actually in the first tweet, it says ""tla twap hft algo for 11-17- 15 , t / s sell quant $ msft $ goog $ gpro $ fb $ aapl $ nflx $ amzn $ qqq URL."" So TSLA isn't mentioned here. Maybe the user made a mistake, or perhaps they meant to list other stocks. But since the output is for a given company, let's assume it's TSLA.

But wait, in the first tweet, it lists multiple companies: Tesla Inc., Amazon, Apple, etc., each with their stock symbols. So perhaps all these tweets are about different stocks related to these companies. If I'm supposed to analyze their impact on TSLA's stock price, that might be tricky because the first tweet doesn't mention TSLA at all.

Hmm, maybe there was a misunderstanding here. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended for all these tweets to collectively provide information about TSLA? But looking at each tweet, none of them directly or indirectly mention TSLA. For example, some talks about Google plus being ""dead,"" others talk about AI companies like Facebook and Amazon. There are no mentions of TSLA in any of the tweets.

Given that, it's challenging to determine the impact on TSLA because none of these tweets specify a particular stock. Without knowing which stock we're analyzing, it's impossible to assess if the sentiment is positive or negative regarding TSLA. The example given in the output shows that they concluded with [Positive], but without context, this is speculative.

Perhaps there's an assumption here that all these tweets are about a specific stock, maybe all related to Tesla? But looking at each tweet, some mention other companies. For instance, ""AT_USER yes , google plus is “ dead ” ( long live googleplus )"" refers to Google Inc., not Tesla. Similarly, ""netflix rolling out spinnaker cloud for alphabet , amazon $ goog $ googl $ amzn $ nflx URL"" mentions Alphabet Inc., which owns TSLA. So I'm starting to think that the tweets are all related to a common stock or perhaps a list of related stocks.

Wait, in the first tweet, it lists ""msft"", ""goog"", ""gpro"", etc. Let's see: msft is Tesla, goog is Google, gpro could be Microsoft (though I'm not entirely sure about their names), fb is Facebook, aapl is Apple, nflx is NVIDIA, amzn is Amazon, qqq might be Microsoft or something else.

So perhaps the tweets are all related to these companies. In that case, each tweet's content can influence investor sentiment for those specific stocks. For example, if any tweet mentions Tesla, it could affect TSLA stock price positively or negatively based on whether investors think it's undervalued or overvalued.

But looking at each tweet:

1. Discusses various tech stocks like Tesla, Google, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Amazon, and others.
2. Talks about Google being ""dead,"" implying a decline.
3. Discusses AT_USER talking about Google Plus becoming unresponsive, suggesting potential negative news for the platform.
4. A diagram explaining Apple's strategy towards its own stock.
5. Mention of Mark Zuckerberg receiving an award for science and tech.
6. Covers various tech trends in tutorials or information.
7. Details Netflix introducing a new service with Alphabet (which owns Tesla).
8. Discusses the ""secret law of attraction,"" which is more about psychology than anything specific to stocks.
9. Talks about companies that have potential to rise, with company-specific valuations mentioned.
10. Reiterates the ""secret law of attraction"" tweet from the previous tweet.
11. Talks about tech companies that could break through in the market.

Given this context, if any of these tweets mention Tesla Inc., it could influence investor sentiment towards TSLA's stock price. For example, a tweet about Google Plus being dead might suggest that Google is undervalued and investors are selling it, which could have an impact on their stock price as well. But since all the tweets don't specify exactly where they point to in terms of Tesla's stock, it's hard to gauge the sentiment directly.

Another angle is looking at specific keywords or phrases. For instance, ""msft"" refers to Tesla, ""goog"" to Google, etc. If any tweet uses these words in a way that suggests a positive or negative market reaction towards those companies, they could influence TSLA's stock price. However, without knowing which keyword relates directly to TSLA, it's difficult to assess.

Given all this uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to consider that none of the tweets provide direct information about Tesla Inc.'s stock. Therefore, based on the provided data, I cannot determine the overall sentiment of TSLA's future stock price because there are no tweets mentioning Tesla directly or indirectly in a way that affects its performance."
2015-11-19,Negative,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to determine the likely impact of these tweets on the stock price of pennystocks. The target stock seems to be pennystocks since they're mentioned in some tweets. Let me go through each tweet one by one and analyze their sentiment towards their overall performance.

Starting with tweet 1: It mentions that IBM's dividend yield is approaching 4%. This could indicate a positive outlook for the company, potentially making it a buy opportunity. But I'm not sure if this alone would significantly affect the stock price unless there are other signs.

Tweet 2 talks about assets jumping on the FTSE 100 and other indices like USDCAD and GM-Sales. While this suggests growth in their markets, it's more of a company-wide performance rather than an immediate impact on pennystocks' financials or fundamentals. So maybe not too strong of a signal.

Tweet 3 mentions that Google, Apple, and Amazon employees are looking to work next. This could be positive because good job opportunities might attract investment, but without specific details about how this will affect the company's performance, it's hard to gauge the impact on their stock price.

Tweets 4-10 all seem to repeat the same sentiment that I mentioned in tweet 3—Google, Apple, and Amazon employees are seeking better opportunities. This could be a bit redundant, but consistent positive info might signal good news for pennystocks.

Tweet 5 is a repetition of tweets 4-7. It's likely trying to highlight the same point about the employees looking for better positions.

Tweet 12 introduces alphavisor and techsparks being above certain thresholds. This could be signaling some technical analysis or market trends, but unless there are positive signals from other factors like earnings, this might not directly affect pennystocks' stock price significantly.

Tweets 13 and 15 talk about stock price updates and company losses in the smartphone industry. A loss could indicate a negative impact on their financials, potentially affecting their stock price if they're a tech company.

Tweet 16 discusses various currencies and indices like US DJIA, SPX (S&P 500), oil prices, gold, etc., but again, this is about broader market performance rather than specific to pennystocks.

Tweets 17 compares Google, Apple, FANG stocks from the past to 2015. This could be an interesting angle if there's a pattern or trend in how these companies perform over time, but without context about their current performance, it's speculative.

Putting this all together, tweets 1 and 6 provide positive indicators that IBM is performing well with good dividend yields, which might boost pennystocks. However, tweets 3-7 suggest potential gains for Google, Apple, Amazon by better employee positions. Tweets 5-7 are just restatements of the same idea.

Other tweets mention broader market performance or currency fluctuations but don't directly relate to pennystocks' stock price changes. The negative tweets (12 and 16) might indicate concern about broader indices, which could affect a diversified portfolio, including pennystocks.

Given that some tweets point towards good company fundamentals and positive news trends, they might have a slight positive influence on pennystocks, but the impact isn't immediate or consistent. The overall sentiment is leaning towards mixed."
2015-11-20,Positive,"Alright, let me tackle this query step by step. So, I'm given a set of tweets and I need to determine if they impact the stock price positively, neutrally, or negatively for a company. The user provided an example output which is [Negative], so my job is to apply similar reasoning.

First, I'll start by identifying the target stock from each tweet. It looks like many of these tweets are related to Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) and other tech companies. Let me go through them one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions ""the fangs $ fb , $ amzn , $ nflx , & $ goog have gained $ 440b in market cap ytd to carry markets."" Wait, that's the FANGS stock, but I'm not sure if the user intended that. Maybe it's a typo for GOOGL? I should note this uncertainty.

2. The second tweet is an update from AT_USER marissa mayer on how Larry and Sergey created a black market. This sounds like positive news about Alphabet, which could boost their stock.

3. The third tweet talks about assets being trending and mentions several stocks: ABBV, DAX, FBEC, GOOG, UNH, etc. Again, FBEC might be a typo for GOOG or another company, but the presence of GOOGL suggests positive sentiment.

4. This tweet is from AT_USER about a startup called ""firstalert"" and others like homekit being competitors to Nest Protect. It doesn't directly mention Alphabet, so I'm not sure how it affects their stock.

5. This tweet lists various companies and their movements. Again, GOOG is mentioned, so maybe this could influence their stock positively.

6. The sixth tweet gives a credit rating update for Alphabet. Credit ratings can indicate investor confidence towards the company's future performance, which might be positive for the stock price.

Now, I need to assess each tweet's impact on GOOGL and possibly others. The second and third tweets are about Alphabet's business operations or market trends, suggesting positive information that could boost their stock. The sixth tweet is a rating update, which is a bit more indirect but could indicate an improving company with a favorable outlook.

However, the first tweet mentions FANGS instead of GOOGL. If it's actually about GOOG, then it would be positive. But if it's a typo or unrelated, I might consider the others. Additionally, the third tweet has assets trending, which might not necessarily boost GOOGL but could influence other tech companies that go up.

Given all these factors, the overall sentiment seems to lean towards a Positive outcome because multiple tweets are pointing towards Alphabet and possibly related companies. The mention of FANGS might indicate some uncertainty, but given the rest of the tweets, it's still positive."
2015-11-21,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price for a given company. The user provided four tweets and wants me to conclude whether they will have a positive, neutral, or negative effect.

First, let's identify each tweet's target stock. But wait, looking at the tweets, none of them explicitly mention a specific stock symbol. That might be confusing. Maybe each tweet refers to different companies, but without their names, it's hard to know which one we're talking about. However, since the user wants a conclusion based on these tweets, perhaps they are referring to the same stock across all four tweets? Or maybe each tweet is a different company?

Let me check the words in each tweet:

1. ""rt AT_USER meeting low expectations ? google selfdrivingcar oct report : no crashes - $ goog iot URL""
2. ""77 % of americans visited a google product in october . $ goog URL""
3. ""goog alphabet inc . - class c ex-div date URL $ goog $ rsx $ kbio $ dbb goog finance invest""
4. ""7 stocks institutional investors bought like crazy in q3 $ amzn $ fb $ goog $ pypl URL via AT_USER""

Hmm, it seems like each tweet is about different companies: Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), and possibly others.

But the user didn't specify which company these tweets are related to. That's a problem because without knowing the stock symbol or the context of the tweet, I can't accurately assess their impact on the stock price.

Wait, maybe each tweet is about Google? Let me look again:

1. The first tweet mentions GOOG.
2. The second one talks about AMZN (Amazon).
3. The third mentions GOOG and others.
4. The fourth also mentions GOOG.

It seems like all tweets are related to Google. But in the first tweet, it's about Google meeting expectations and a report on self-driving cars. The second is about American visitors to Google products. The third is about Alphabet (which owns Google) with some ex-divide info. The fourth is about institutional investors buying shares of Amzn, FB, and others.

So all four tweets are related to Google or companies that are part of Alphabet? Maybe the user intended each tweet to be about a specific stock. Let me assume each one refers to different stocks.

But without knowing which specific stock each tweet pertains to, I can't analyze their impact accurately. However, maybe the user is referring to a single company across all four tweets, but it's unclear from the text provided.

Alternatively, perhaps they are asking about Alphabet Inc., given the use of ""goog"" and ""alphabet"". But since the words in each tweet don't specify the stock symbol, I need more context. If I have to make an assumption, maybe the target is Alphabet Inc., or one of its subsidiaries like Google, Apple (AAPL), or Microsoft (MSFT). 

But without knowing the exact stock, it's impossible to determine the sentiment impact on its price. Each tweet could be about a different company.

Given that, I think the user might have intended each tweet to refer to a specific stock but didn't include their symbols. Since I don't have that information, I can't accurately assess whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative regarding any particular stock. Therefore, my analysis would be incomplete without knowing which company is being discussed."
2015-11-22,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a given company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, from the provided tweets:

1. Sunday links: picking pickers : URL $ aapl $ goog $ pcln $ k
2. goog alphabet inc . ideas URL $ goog $ ewm $ vwinx $ hyg goog pennystocks nasdaq
3. $ goog - facebook inc . is crushing google in display ads - should alphabet investors be worried ? URL
4. tickers trending on twtr in last 1 hour ftse 100 $ eurusd $ goog URL URL
5. AT_USER can you imagine if $ fb or $ goog had of these $ yhoo operational issues ? stocks would implode !
6. track trending assets in 1 watchlist $ audusd $ dax $ gbpusd $ eurusd $ goog URL … … … … … … … URL
7. rxmd progressive care , inc . % change URL $ rxmd $ goog $ vale $ rsp $ vale rxmd share finance

I'll start by identifying the target stock from each tweet, which seems to be ""goog"" based on some tweets mentioning it. The company is Alphabet Inc., also known as Google, so I can assume the target stock is the one with the ticker symbol G.

Now, let's analyze each tweet:

1. ""picking pickers : URL $ aapl $ goog $ pcln $ k"" - This doesn't mention any relevant factors or trends; it seems like just some links and symbols without any analysis.
2. ""goog alphabet inc . ideas URL $ goog $ ewm $ vwinx $ hyg goog pennystocks nasdaq"" - This includes the ticker symbol for Alphabet (A) and mentions other companies, but no specific factors about Google's performance.
3. ""$ goog - facebook inc . is crushing google in display ads - should alphabet investors be worried ? URL"" - The tweet suggests that Facebook's ads are negatively impacting Google, which could affect investor sentiment towards Alphabet. This sounds like a negative factor.
4. ""tickers trending on twtr in last 1 hour ftse 100 $ eurusd $ goog URL URL"" - This is about the stock prices of Alphabet (A) and the EUR/USD exchange rate, but no specific factors related to Google's performance. It seems neutral here.
5. ""AT_USER can you imagine if $ fb or $ goog had of these $ yhoo operational issues ? stocks would implode !"" - This tweet is hypothetical and suggests that if Facebook (FB) or Alphabet had issues with YHOO, it could make Alphabet's stock collapse. This indicates a negative scenario for investors.
6. ""track trending assets in 1 watchlist $ audusd $ dax $ gbpusd $ eurusd $ goog URL … … … … … … … URL"" - It talks about tracking assets on a watchlist and mentions the EUR/USD exchange rate, but no specific analysis on Google's performance.
7. ""rxmd progressive care , inc . % change URL $ rxmd $ goog $ vale $ rsp $ vale rxmd share finance"" - This tweet suggests that if Proactive Solutions (PX) has a percentage change in their stock price, Alphabet's stock would suffer. The mention of VAlVE and RSP indicates concerns about Alphabet's performance relative to their competitors.

Now, I'll assess each tweet's impact:

1. Unrelated and just links.
2. No factors or trends mentioned.
3. Negative factor from Facebook impacting Google, which could affect investors.
4. No specific factors related to Google; only stock prices are considered.
5. Hypothetical scenario predicting a collapse if other companies have issues, indicating concern.
6. Titrating assets but no specific impact on Google.
7. Concern about Alphabet's performance relative to another company (PX), which could influence investor sentiment.

Considering all the tweets, there is some negative information pointing towards Alphabet's potential decline due to Facebook's issues and concerns about their relative performance. The overall sentiment seems mixed, with both positive aspects mentioned but no clear confirmation of Google's strengths or recent good news."
2015-11-23,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the given company. The target stock symbol isn't specified here, so maybe it's a common one like AAPL or GOOG? Let me look at each tweet to see what they're about.

First tweet: ""can google stunt amazon ’ s breakneck cloud growth ? : URL"". That seems like a joke or a mockup because of the mention of Google and Amazon. It doesn't seem positive, negative, or neutral—it's more of a playful comment.

Second tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ scie strap up $ biei $ kbio $ owoo $ capv $ hart $ mjna $ hemp $ btfl $ wrfx $ pvsp $ slnn $ gnpt $ aapl $ goog $ tdey $ pypl"". This looks like a random Twitter thread listing different stocks, which doesn't convey any meaningful information about the company. It might be irrelevant.

Third tweet: ""xli technology select sector spdr e . p . s . URL $ xli $ goog $ uvxy $ googl xli tradeideas investing"". Similar to the second one, this seems like a list of unrelated stocks without any context or discussion. No positive or negative factors here.

Fourth tweet: ""rt AT_USER baba alibaba group holding ltd . ask URL $ baba $ goog $ intu $ ment baba invest share"". Again, another Twitter thread listing different stocks. It's not providing any meaningful information about the company either.

Fifth tweet: ""$ goog - dubai internet city : 3 things you should know URL"". This looks like a link to some content from Dubai or a news article about Google. It could be promoting something related to Google's operations in Dubai, which is a positive note because Google has a presence there. The mention ofDubai might indicate expansion into new markets, which could positively impact the stock price.

So, out of all these tweets, only the fifth one seems like it's contributing any meaningful information. It mentions Google's expansion in Dubai, which can be seen as a positive sign for the company. The others are either irrelevant or playful. Therefore, considering the overall sentiment, there might still be some positive impact from this tweet."
2015-11-24,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided a set of tweets and wants me to analyze them to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. They've also given specific steps to take.

First, I need to extract the target stock from each tweet. That seems straightforward since some tweets mention the stock symbol in lowercase, like 'apl' for Apple. So, I can assume the stock is Apple Inc. (AAPL) based on common patterns.

Next, for each tweet, I have to identify positive and negative factors. That part might be a bit tricky because some tweets are a bit vague or lack context. For example, in the fifth tweet, it mentions ""how can the recent terrorist attacks affect shares of $ goog , $ aapl , $ msft , $ twtr , and $ fb ?"" I'm not sure how to parse this, but I think focusing on the words related to Apple would be key here.

Then, evaluating sentiment from each tweet. This involves looking at the wording and context. If a tweet is talking about positive developments, it's probably a positive factor. Conversely, if discussing challenges or negative events, it'll be negative. It's important to assess based on the specific content of each tweet rather than just overall.

After collecting all the factors for each tweet, I need to summarize the sentiment for the entire set. If there are more positive tweets, that should lean towards a positive overall sentiment. Similarly, if most are negative or neutral, that will guide my conclusion.

Looking at the provided tweets, some mention specific projects like Alphabet inc's debt relief, while others discuss broader topics like terrorist attacks affecting shares of different companies. Some tweets have URLs but don't provide actionable information about Apple, which might make it hard to extract factors related to Apple itself.

Since several tweets are about other companies and their impact on Google's stock, the sentiment analysis from those wouldn't directly affect Apple. The main positive tweet mentions Alphabet inc helping reduce debt at lower rates, which could indirectly support Apple but not necessarily through direct links.

Overall, the majority of the tweets seem to be neutral or slightly negative because they don't provide concrete information about Apple. There's a mix of vague projects and speculative topics that add uncertainty. Without more specific data on Apple's recent activities, it's challenging to determine whether there are any positive factors influencing their stock price.

Therefore, I think the best course is to conclude with [Neutral] as the overall sentiment because the information provided doesn't indicate a clear trend either positive or negative."
2015-11-25,Neutral,"Alright, let me go through the tweets and see how they impact the stock price of the company in question.

First tweet mentions screens high-rated articles for us tech kings. That sounds positive. It's encouraging investors to stay informed about companies, which can boost confidence. 

The second tweet says Google is being upgraded with VECTR, which shows a strategic move. Upgrades often indicate potential growth and could be seen as good news, but I'm not sure if it's necessarily positive or negative yet.

Third tweet talks about AI advancements like nightcap and bigdata. AI innovation can drive growth in tech stocks, especially if they're in the gaming or finance sector. This seems positive.

Fourth tweet discusses another AI-focused topic with security concerns. Security issues might lower investor confidence, but they could still be viewed as a positive signal if it's not affecting market overall sentiment negatively.

Fifth tweet mentions Google spending $1 per transaction on payments. That sounds like a significant expense that could affect profitability and hence stock price, which is negative.

Sixth tweet provides oil, aviation, Google, and semiconductor prices. Positive news about major industries can boost confidence for tech stocks, especially if these are sectors where companies operate heavily. But it's also speculative without knowing how it ties into the specific company in question.

Seventh tweet repeats a similar topic from the third one, focusing on AI and nightcap. It reinforces the positive message about potential growth areas, but again, not conclusive yet.

Eighth tweet talks about Tesla stock trading at $213 with strategies triggered by other companies like sigma-x. This could be a short-term correction or indicator of increased interest in tech stocks from others. Not sure how it affects my target company, but it's anecdotal.

Ninth tweet seems unrelated as it's about seekingalpha and Yelp. Doesn't impact the stock price negatively or positively.

Putting it all together: Some tweets are positive indicators for investor confidence (tweets 1-7), while one is a significant expense (tweet 5) and some provide background (tweets 6,8). The overall sentiment isn't clear-cut because there's mixed information. It could be mixed, but leaning more towards cautiously optimistic due to the various positive factors mentioned."
2015-11-26,Neutral,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The task is to determine whether each tweet has a positive, neutral, or negative impact on the stock price of a company based on the given tweets.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ $ ] for apple and venmo , china shows what lies ahead : URL $ aapl $ goog $ pcln $ k"". It seems like the stock symbols involved are AAPL (Apple) and PCLN (Procter & Gamble). Since the problem mentions determining impact on the given company, I'll focus on those two.

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. Each tweet is a single line of text, so I have to analyze each one individually. However, since there are multiple tweets, I'll process them one by one and then combine the results.

Looking at the second tweet: ""mux mcewen mining inc . volume URL $ mux $ goog $ pli.to $ nmdc.in mux stockmarket share"". It mentions MUX (which is a company) and MUCEWEN MINING, but I'm not sure about their financial performance. The mention of volume might suggest interest in the stock but it's unclear if it affects the price positively or negatively.

The third tweet: ""$ goog - this popular streaming service is conspicuously absent from t-mobile's latest promotion URL"". Here, the user is pointing out a gap between Google (GOOGL) and another company (T-Mobile likely, given their names). This could affect investor sentiment if they think Google is overpriced relative to T-Mobile.

The fourth tweet: ""learn how to analyze the market right here $ hd $ goog URL"". It seems like a general advice tweet encouraging others to learn about the market. It might not have a strong positive or negative impact unless there's specific information from this tweet that affects the stock, which isn't clear here.

Finally, the fifth tweet: ""$ goog recent news updated wednesday , november 25 , 2015 5:07 : 11 pm $ mu $ aezs $ cvx $ csco URL"". It refers to Google's recent news on November 25th at 5:07 PM. Without knowing if this is positive or negative news about Google, it's hard to assess the impact.

Now, compiling the sentiment analysis:
- AT_USER with AAPL and PCLN mentions China but doesn't provide specific info.
- MUX and MUCEWEN MINING likely have their own performance indicators but no direct links.
- The third tweet suggests a gap between Google and T-Mobile, which could mean Google's stock might be undervalued if competitors are doing well.
- Fourth tweet is too vague for sentiment impact.
- Fifth tweet refers to an event on a specific date, but without context on the day, it's speculative.

Putting it all together, I'm leaning towards neutral because while there are multiple points about Google being absent from T-Mobile's promotion or related news, these don't provide clear positive or negative indicators. The other companies mentioned might have their own performance factors. Therefore, the overall sentiment is neutral."
2015-11-27,Missing,File not found
2015-11-28,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for the given company. The user provided some tweets and asked me to conclude with a positive, neutral, or negative sentiment.

First, I need to understand each tweet separately. The first tweet mentions that certain tickers are trending in the past hour and lists them as $aapl, $dow, $eusd, etc., which probably means they're tracking stock symbols of different companies, not the actual stock names. 

Then there's another tweet with ""apple's dominance in 3 charts,"" which again is a bit confusing because it refers to company names instead of stock ticker symbols. It might be indicating that Apple's performance across three charts is significant.

Looking at these tweets, I don't see any mentions of actual stock prices or company names. They seem more like indicators of market trends rather than specific company details. Since the tweets are just about market movements and don't provide information on stock performance metrics, their impact on the stock price isn't directly assessable from these tweets alone.

Therefore, without specific data points about earnings, revenue, news events, or other relevant factors that would affect stock prices, it's impossible to determine if these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative. They're just general market trends and chart indicators, not actionable information for assessing a company's financial health.

So, the conclusion should be that the overall sentiment is ""[Neutral]"" because there's insufficient information from these tweets to make a decision about the stock price."
2015-11-29,Neutral,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for nem newmont mining corp. 

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""nem newmont mining corp . yield URL $ nem $. So the stock is NEM.

Now, for each tweet, I'll separate the factors into positive and negative. Let's go one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions 'yield' but that doesn't ring a bell, so maybe it's neutral or not impactful.
2. ""sem select medical holdings corp . 52wk high URL."" It talks about stock performance and investing, which could affect investor sentiment positively.
3. ""rt AT_USER $ goog - 5 companies leading the internet of things revolution URL"" is an intriguing quote from a user reacting to Google's leadership in IOT. This might boost interest or confidence, but it's speculative without more context.
4. ""rt AT_USER china rate cut + $ goog $ amzn $ msft = 'rally fever on wall street' says AT_USER."" The mention of a rate cut and the rally feeling could be positive because lower rates might make stocks like AMZN and MSFT more attractive, especially if they're undervalued.
5. ""top trade patterns in stock ... cheer . $ study $ aapl $ baba $ fb $ xom $ cvx $ amzn $ goog $ msft $ ibm $ mon stockmarket URL."" Again, this seems to be talking about the stock market in general and how people are reacting, which could indicate overall market optimism.
6. ""which will be the first trillion dollar company ? $ aapl $ goog $ fb $ am zn learn more : URL"" is a question asking about the first big company to reach a trillion dollars, which sounds positive because it's highlighting growth.

Now, assessing sentiment for each tweet:

1. Unrelated factors, so neutral.
2. Positive because they're investing and talking about stock performance; likely positive.
3. Speculative but mentions a company trend, might be positive or neutral.
4. Rate cut and rally feeling could boost investor confidence; positive.
5. General market reaction to the stock market; positive.
6. Asking for information on growth, which is positive.

Considering all these, most tweets are positive in terms of investor sentiment. However, tweet 3 is speculative but might not have enough context. So overall, it's a mix, but leaning towards positive because many factors point to good sentiment, especially with the rate cut and market reactions."
2015-11-30,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the user provided two tweets. I'll look at each one individually and see what they're saying and how that affects the company.

The first tweet is: ""$ mhrc has now gained 756.25 % in the past 2 weeks ! huge news : URL $ amzn $ mcox $ goog"". It looks like a typo or placeholder for some specific stock symbols, but it mentions that MHRC's value has increased by over 700% in two weeks and is linked to Amazon, Marvel, and Google. High growth could mean investors are buying more shares, which might boost the stock price positively.

The second tweet: ""rt AT_USER lots of interest in self-driving cars + taxis globally $ aapl $ goog $ tsla URL URL"". This seems like it's talking about a lot of interest from users in self-driving cars and taxis. If people are interested and enthusiastic about these technologies, that could attract investors who want to invest in electric vehicles or related companies. That might also lead to a positive impact on Amazon, which I suppose is a big tech company, but maybe not directly tied here.

Now, considering both tweets together: the first mentions a significant rise in MHRC's value and ties it to multiple tech companies. The second talks about increased interest in self-driving technologies, which could drive stock prices for companies like Tesla (TSLA), Amazon, and Google if they're investing in EVs or related products.

But I'm not sure how directly these tweets are connected to Amazon. The first one might be more of a trend that some investors expect, leading them to buy more shares as it's seen as a good sign for their portfolio. The second tweet is about demand for self-driving cars, which could attract specific types of investors but isn't inherently tied to Amazon's stock.

I'm leaning towards the overall sentiment being positive because both tweets are highlighting potential growth areas that could drive investor interest. However, it's not entirely clear if these are the strongest factors influencing the stock price or just side effects. There might be other market-moving events or company-specific news that aren't mentioned here which also play a role.

So I think it's more about the trend and positive attention rather than direct correlation to Amazon's stock performance."
2015-12-01,Positive,"Alright, I need to determine the likely impact on the stock price of the given company based on the provided tweets. The user has given me four tweets and an output requirement for the final conclusion.

First, I'll extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. 

1. The first tweet mentions ""Great gift"" with a URL pointing to $ msft. So, the target stock is Microsoft (MSFT).

2. The second tweet includes multiple links ending with $ spy, which refers to SPY, also known as MSFT. So, both tweets 1 and 2 are about Microsoft.

3. The third tweet mentions ""institutional ownership up"" for Google. Here, the target is Google (GOOGL). 

4. The fourth tweet talks about Apple Inc. with a stock symbol $ aapl. The fifth tweet mentions Bank of America with $ bank, which is BOLOGNE, though not a known symbol. Wait, let me check: no, that's actually Bank of America as BOLOGNE? Or is it another company? Actually, BOLOGNE might be the wrong spelling; perhaps it's ""Bank of America"" or ""BoL"" for something else. But since it's unclear, I'll assume it's a different stock.

Wait, in the fourth tweet: 4. 2016 boom ? : hybrids or ""detachABLES : "" tablets such as the new apple ipad pro , Microsoft surface pro & Google's pixe "" $ aapl $ msft $ goog

So, from this, the target stocks are Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG). 

Wait, but in the fifth tweet: 5. rt AT_USER barclays sees three of four fang stocks continuing outperformance $ amzn $ nflx $ goog $ googl $ fb : full story URL

So, from this tweet, the target is Amzn ($ AMZN), Nflx (NFCX or others?), Google (GOOG), and Facebook (FB). So, Apple isn't mentioned here.

Now, summarizing:

- Tweet 1: MSFT
- Tweet 2: MSFT
- Tweet 3: GOOG
- Tweet 4: AAPL, GOOG
- Tweet 5: AMZN, NFCX/FB

Wait, the user also provided a list of tweets that might be related. Let me check:

Looking back at the initial setup, the user's tweets are:

1. great gift ! christmas holiday green cast iron infuser teapot & holiday teas URL xmas $ msft $ goog $ m $ bac $ c $ cake
2. rt AT_USER tips on saving money URL $ dia $ spy $ qqq $ aapl $ fb $ goog mark zuckerberg URL
3. $ goog institutional ownership up 2.87 % q / q , with 14,877 , 600 net purchase URL URL
4. 2016 boom ? : hybrids or ""detachABLES : "" tablets such as the new apple ipad pro ,Microsoft surface pro & Google's pixe "" $ aapl $ msft $ goog
5. rt AT_USER barclays sees three of four fang stocks continuing outperformance $ amzn $ nflx $ goog $ googl $ fb : full story URL

Wait, perhaps I misread some of the tweets. Let me parse each one carefully.

1. The first tweet: It mentions MSFT (Microsoft) as part of a URL with multiple dollar signs, but it's ""great gift"" and ""chocolate teas."" There are several stock symbols here: $ msft, $ goog, $ m, $ bac, $ c, $ cake. So the target is Microsoft.

2. Second tweet: The links end with $ spy (SPY), which is MSFT. So again, MSFT.

3. Third tweet: $ goog mentions institutional ownership up for Google.

4. Fourth tweet: "" detachedables"" and ""apple ipad pro"", so targets are Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG).

5. Fifth tweet: barclays mentions AMZN (Amazon), NFLX (NFCX, which is a different company), GOOG, and FB (Facebook). So three outperforming.

Now, putting it together:

- MSFT: appears in tweets 1,2,4
- GOOG: tweets 3,4
- AAPL: tweet 4

Additionally, Twitter can imply sentiment. From the context:

Tweet 1: Positive because of a gift and holiday theme.
Tweet 2: Also positive with tips on saving money.
Tweet 3: Positive about Google's ownership.

Tweet 4 mentions Apple as a ""detachABLES"" product line, which might be positive for Apple (positive for Apple's product).

Tweet 5 has mixed, but given the full story, it seems like Amzn is performing well, which could indicate good news for Amazon, so positive sentiment there.

So, overall, multiple tweets are pointing towards good performance in tech companies. MSFT, GOOG, and possibly AAPL. The presence of positive tips on saving money (tweet 2) might be a bit more informal but still indicates positive investor sentiment.

Therefore, the stock is likely to have a positive impact."
2015-12-02,Neutral,"Alright, so I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their likely impact on the stock price of Google. Let me start by breaking down what each tweet says.

First, I'm looking at the target stock symbol, which is ""goog"". The tweets are about various topics related to investing, marketing strategies, tech companies, etc. My job is to assess the sentiment of each tweet towards the stock and then determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral overall.

Starting with tweet 1: Alphabet Inc ( goog ) downgraded byvet inc . to “ sell ” URL $ goog. That's a straightforward statement about reducing their investment in VET. It seems like they're taking some action that could impact investor sentiment. I think this would likely be positive because if a company is selling other investments, it might be seen as strategic rather than just an expense.

Looking at tweet 2: The user tips on saving money across multiple companies like spy, qqq, aapl, etc. While the content is about financial advice, the tweets don't mention anything specific related to Google. However, since they're suggesting general savings strategies, it might be seen as neutral because there's no clear positive or negative impact on the stock directly.

Tweets 3 and 4 are repeating "" Tips on saving money "", which again doesn't tie into Google. So I'm leaning towards a neutral response here because nothing concrete is mentioned about the company in these tweets.

Moving to tweet 5: Investment in drone industry. The user mentions it's important for improving quality of life, so this could be positive. Companies that are involved in niche markets or helping certain groups can attract investments if they're seen as beneficial. This might have a positive impact on Google's stock because it could lead to increased demand for drones and related services.

Tweet 6 is about picking stocks but also avoiding the stock market by selecting companies in the industry. It seems like a neutral sentiment here because there's no direct mention of Google or its stock, so I'm unsure but probably neutral.

Tweets 7-10 are talking about ""tips on saving money"" again, which doesn't connect to Google. These could be seen as positive for general investors looking to save without specific ties to the company in question.

Tweet 9: The user is discussing a potential future of $ yhOO and other tech companies, suggesting that managing expenses and cash flow might improve things. If the company expects this to help, it could attract investors because improving financial metrics might be seen as strategic and beneficial for the stock price.

Tweets 10: Discusses casino companies and angling kids, which doesn't tie into Google or its stock at all. So again, neutral here since there's no direct impact on Google.

Lastly, tweet 11 is about another company, dicks sporting goods, but again, no link to Google. So it's not directly related, keeping it neutral.

Putting this all together: There are a few positive tweets like 1 and 5 that could have some positive impacts if seen as strategic moves or beneficial for investors. However, there are also several neutral tweets about general financial advice without specific ties. Some tweets (7-10) discuss saving money but not Google, so they might be considered neutral. The overall sentiment seems to have a few positive elements but mixed with neutrals and negatives from the other tweets. I'm leaning towards a mix of factors making it medium positive because several of them could impact the stock if seen as beneficial or strategic."
2015-12-03,Positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a given company. Let's see... The user provided a list of 12 tweets and asked me to analyze their likely effect on a hypothetical stock.

First, I should identify the target stock. Hmm, looking through the tweets, I don't immediately see any symbols except maybe something like QQQ or SPY? Wait, no, in the context given, there's ""qqq"", which is Apple's symbol for quantum computing. But maybe that's a typo. Let me check again.

Wait, actually, looking at the tweets:

1. rt AT_USER tips on saving money URL $ dia $ spy $ qqq $ aapl $ fb $ goog mark zuckerberg URL
2. Same as tweet 1
3. salt scorpio bulkers inc . message board posts URL $ salt $ pff $ goog $ v salt invest finance
4. smn proshares ultrashort basic materials company info URL $ smn $ tza $ gild $ goog smn stocks investing
5. rt AT_USER tips on saving money URL $ dia $ spy $ qqq $ aapl $ fb $ goog mark zuckerberg URL
6. geography plays a major role in whether you're for or against self-driving cars $ goog $ tsla URL
7. rt AT_USER youtube in talks with studios over streaming rights for shows , movies - wsj URL $ goog
8. $ nwav closed up a whopping 55.56 % ! major expectations for next week : URL $ cbl $ goog $ bll
9. apple iphone growth poised to lag android : URL $ aapl $ goog $ pcln $ k
10. $ goog - youtube seeks streaming rights to tv shows , movies URL
11. rt AT_USER record number of AT_USER users make the switch with iphone 6s $ aapl , $ goog URL URL
12. rt AT_USER tips on saving money URL $ dia $ spy $ qqq $ aapl $ fb $ goog mark zuckerberg URL

Hmm, I'm a bit confused because the user hasn't specified which stock to analyze. The tweets include multiple symbols like QQQ, SPY, QNT, etc., but none of these seem immediately related to a single company. Maybe there's an assumption here? Perhaps they're referring to General Linear Technologies (GLW) or something similar?

Assuming that the target stock is QQQ (General Linear Technologies), I'll proceed with that.

Now, let's analyze each tweet one by one for positive or negative factors.

1. ""rt AT_USER tips on saving money URL $ dia $ spy $ qqq $ aapl $ fb $ goog mark zuckerberg URL"" – This seems like a promotional message encouraging users to save money. It mentions several stocks: QQQ, APPL, FB, GOOG, MARK, ZUMERberg. These are all large tech companies. Positive factor here.

2. Same as tweet 1 – Another set of financial tips and stock recommendations. Again, multiple tech companies mentioned. Positive sentiment.

3. ""salt scorpio bulkers inc . message board posts URL $ salt $ pff $ goog $ v salt invest finance"" – Talks about the company's message board and investor sentiment regarding their upcoming earnings or stock performance. The tweet suggests that investors are looking for information on their future performance, which could influence sentiment.

4. ""smn proshares ultrashort basic materials company info URL $ smn $ tza $ gild $ goog smn stocks investing"" – Promotional message about a company's basic materials segment and investment info. Positive factor as it's encouraging investors to research the company.

5. Same as tweet 1 – Again, financial tips on saving money across multiple companies. Still positive sentiment towards general savings advice.

6. ""geography plays a major role in whether you're for or against self-driving cars $ goog $ tsla URL"" – Discusses how geography affects consumer choice for self-driving cars and mentions Tesla (TSLA). Positive factor here as it's about future technology trends, encouraging investors to follow the market.

7. ""rt AT_USER youtube in talks with studios over streaming rights for shows , movies - wsj URL $ goog"" – Discusses YouTube integrating streaming rights into their content strategy. This could influence investor sentiment by suggesting that companies are exploring new revenue streams, which is generally positive.

8. ""$ nwav closed up a whopping 55.56 % ! major expectations for next week : URL $ cbl $ goog $ bll"" – Positive stock price movement with strong expectations for the company's performance next week. This suggests that investors are optimistic about future prospects, leading to positive sentiment.

9. ""apple iPhone growth poised to lag android : URL $ aapl $ goog $ pcln $ k"" – Compare iPhone sales growth with Android adoption. If one is expected to lag due to market dynamics, it could impact the overall tech sector's performance, which in turn affects GLW stock price. Positive factor here as it highlights market trends.

10. "" $ goog - youtube seeks streaming rights to tv shows , movies URL"" – Similar to tweet 7, indicating YouTube is seeking streaming rights for content. This might mean that companies are expanding their services or content distribution, which could influence investor sentiment positively.

11. ""rt AT_USER record number of AT_USER users make the switch with iphone 6s $ aapl , $ goog URL URL"" – Promotional message encouraging users to upgrade their iPhones with GM's guidance. Positive factor as it provides user value through product updates and promotions, which can boost sales and stock price.

12. ""rt AT_USER tips on saving money URL $ dia $ spy $ qqq $ aapl $ fb $ goog mark zuckerberg URL"" – Again, financial advice promoting savings across multiple companies. Still positive sentiment as it's about general consumer trends.

Now, combining all these factors: Positive tweets (tweets 1-5) focus on consumer tips and technology stocks. Negative or neutral tweets don't come to mind yet. The final tweet (tweet 8) shows strong expectations for the company's performance, which is a positive indicator of investor confidence.

However, none of the tweets specifically mention General Linear Technologies. If it's not clear from the context, perhaps there's an ambiguity here. But given that the user has specified to conclude with one tag, I'll assume they're referring to a specific stock and proceed accordingly.

Overall, the sentiment seems positive due to several mentions of consumer trends, technology companies (which can be seen as broader market performance indicators), and potential for growth in tech sectors. However, without more context about GLW's current position or recent events, it's hard to determine if there are any negative factors.

So, considering all these points, I'll conclude with a positive sentiment."
2015-12-04,Positive,"Alright, let's break down how I approached this task step by step.

First, I read the problem carefully and understood that I had to analyze tweets related to a stock's potential impact on its future price. The user provided 36 tweets and asked me to determine their impact as positive, neutral, or negative.

I started by identifying the target stock symbol. Looking through the tweets, I noticed most of them mention ""goog,"" which is the symbol for Google. So, I concluded that the target stock is likely Google (GOOGL).

Next, I considered each tweet. Many of these tweets are repetitive with similar phrases like ""rt AT_USER is $ goog looking to buyout $ mkau ..."" and ""someone told $ . 50 + is comingwithin 30 days."" They seem to suggest that the stock might increase in value, as indicated by the ""coming within 30 days"" part. This pattern suggests a positive outlook.

I started listing each tweet and noting that each one expresses confidence in Google's potential performance, implying an expectation of growth. The repetition indicates a steady emphasis on the company's financial health and future prospects.

Considering all the tweets, they are consistent with a positive sentiment. They don't show any contradictory information or negative statements. Instead, they're all reinforcing the belief that the stock is likely to increase in value over time.

I also considered why other categorizations (like Neutral or Negative) might be relevant. Since none of the tweets suggest uncertainty or concern, and instead hint at optimism about future outcomes, I ruled out [Neutral] or [Negative].

Finally, after reviewing all 36 tweets and noting their collective positive tone and consistent statements, I concluded that the overall sentiment is positive."
2015-12-05,Neutral,"Okay, let's try to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the company. I'm not an expert in stock analysis, but I'll go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the information given, each tweet seems to be from a user who is trying to buyout $mkau. They're talking about $ goog (which I believe is Alphabet's stock) and mention something about $ .50 + coming within 30 days. That ""50+"" probably refers to a specific amount or percentage that might affect the stock price.

From what I gather, all these tweets are repetitive and similar in content. Each one just repeats the same message: the user is buying out another stock (""$ goog looking to buyout $ mkau"") and tells others about an upcoming event related to the stock price ($ .50 + coming within 30 days). 

So, I don't see any positive or negative information in these tweets. They all seem neutral because they're just repeating a trend or action that could potentially affect the stock. The user is indicating a potential improvement or something that might happen in the near future, which is usually a sign of positive news.

Since every tweet is the same and there's no indication of any favorable or unfavorable information, I think it's safe to assume that the overall sentiment here doesn't lean towards positive or negative. It seems more like a common event happening on all platforms where these tweets are shared."
2015-12-06,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact on the future stock price of the given company based on these tweets. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First tweet: It mentions transaction costs and spreadbetting but doesn't seem to give any specific information about Google's performance or future stock changes. So I can probably ignore this one.

Second tweet talks about art stopmotion and URL spreading, also not mentioning anything about the company itself.

Third tweet is about social media companies fighting against militant propaganda, again no mention of Google or its stock.

Fourth tweet says something about Google cloud security being scanned and reaching general availability. That's interesting because it's a specific news related to the company. So this could indicate improved infrastructure or services, which might positively impact the stock price.

Fifth tweet discusses balance sheet details, but without specifics on what the balance is or how it affects the company, I'm not sure. It seems more like a factual update than a performance indicator.

Sixth tweet mentions access to curated tweets with less spam, targeting US tech giants. Again, no specific information about Google's stock performance here either.

Putting this together, only the fourth tweet gives me concrete info about Google. It talks about cloud security advancements, which can be seen as a positive sign for investors because it indicates ongoing efforts to improve their services. While there are other tweets, none provide direct information on financial indicators or future outlook that would influence the stock price.

So overall, based on the data I have, the fourth tweet seems like a key point of positive news related to Google's technology and infrastructure."
2015-12-07,Negative,"Okay, let's see what I need to do here. The user has given me some tweets and asks me to analyze their impact on a company's stock price, specifically whether it's positive, neutral, or negative. They also provided an example of how to structure the analysis.

First, I'll start by identifying the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the tweets:

1. ""rt AT_USER interesting : google's chromebooks make up half of classroom devices - $ goog education URL""
   - Hmm, this one mentions Google's Chromebooks being a part of classroom devices, and then points to $ goog as the stock symbol. So the target is Google.

2. ""$ goog alphabet inc's new google glass is bound to be another flop : alphabet inc's new google glass is bound t ... URL""
   - Again, Google is mentioned in this tweet about Alphabet Inc.'s Google Glasses.

3. ""goog alphabet inc . - class c market cap URL $ goog $ lqd $ tbt $ low goog invest pennystocks""
   - This seems like a follow-up or another analysis of Alphabet's performance, possibly looking at their valuation and stock sentiment.

4. ""$ goog filings updated sunday , december 6 , 2015 9:06 : 40 pm $ amat $ euo $ ko $ mu URL""
   - Here, Google is mentioned with its financial filings being updated on December 6th.

5. "" tsla twitter , inc . exchange URL $ tsla $ pmcb $ goog $ lulu tsla stock pennystocks""
   - This tweet mentions Tesla's Twitter account and their stock price.

Now that I have the target stocks, I need to analyze each tweet in terms of factors—Positive and Negative—and how they might impact the stock.

For the first tweet, it seems like Google is being praised for Chromebooks contributing to classroom devices. That could be a positive factor as it highlights success and investment in core tech areas.

The second tweet points out that Alphabet's Google Glasses might be another flop. If they're not performing well or if competitors are entering the market, this could negatively impact their stock.

The third tweet also mentions Alphabet but doesn't provide specifics on the factors yet. It might be a deeper analysis of performance or valuation, which isn't clear right now.

The fourth tweet is about Google's 2015 filings and mentions their stock being updated, which can indicate investor sentiment towards them.

The fifth tweet discusses Tesla, not Google, but it could affect the overall market and therefore Google's performance if there are shifts in tech trends.

Looking at each tweet:

1. Positive: Google's Chromebooks being part of classroom devices could boost investor confidence.
2. Negative: Alphabet's Google Glasses might not be performing as expected, affecting their valuation.
3. Not much info yet, but possibly looking into performance factors.
4. Positive: Google's continued filing update may indicate interest in the market and stock price changes.
5. Doesn't impact Google directly.

Now, combining these thoughts:

- Google seems to have a positive outlook with Chromebooks mentioned, which could boost their stock.
- Alphabet has concerns about Google Glasses performing well, which could lead to negative sentiment if they're not successful.
- The other tweets may provide more context on Alphabet's performance but don't add immediate information on Google.

So overall, the impact isn't certain. There are both positive and potential negative factors depending on how Alphabet's performance stacks up against expectations."
2015-12-08,Neutral,"Okay, let's see what I need to do here. The user has provided two tweets and asked me to analyze their impact on a company's stock price using ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"". 

First, I should figure out the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet: ""uptrend stocks in technology $ adsk $ amat $ aph $ brcm $ ca $ flir $ fslr $ goog $ hrs $ ibm URL"". The most common word there is ""goog"" which stands for Google, so I think that's the stock we're looking at. 

Now, analyzing each tweet one by one.

The first tweet: ""uptrend stocks in technology $ adsk $ amat $ aph $ brcm $ ca $ flir $ fslr $ goog $ hrs $ ibm URL"". The words here are ""uptrend stocks"", ""tech"", and some other symbols. It doesn't mention Google, so maybe this isn't related to the target stock. I should consider it as irrelevant or neutral because there's no connection.

The second tweet: ""$ goog alphabet inc ( googl ) is jennison associates ' 7th largest position : alphabet inc ( googl ) is jennison ass ... URL"". This seems like a resume search query about Google Alphabet, but the main part is discussing Google as a company. It mentions that Google Alphabet is the 7th largest in terms of shares traded and it's looking for someone named Jennison associate. The structure here makes me think this tweet might be trying to engage with the reader by asking about Google, so maybe there's some positive sentiment from that angle.

Since the first tweet doesn't mention Google and the second one has a query related to Google but without any stock data or analysis, I can't really infer much. The second tweet is more about building a relationship with the company than making a stock-related decision. 

Putting it all together, only the first tweet isn't directly relevant, and the second doesn't provide enough context for stock impact. So overall sentiment seems neutral."
2015-12-09,Negative,"Okay, I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for a given company. The user provided five tweets, each mentioning different companies and factors related to them. My task is to assess each tweet's likely effect based on the information given.

First, let me go through each tweet one by one. 

1. The first tweet mentions tlt sharing with Barclays, including some URLs. It says ""20 + year treasury bond fund filings URL"" and talks about a tlt share investment. I don't have specific details about tullow & lynch or their stock performance, but it's about the company itself.

2. The second tweet is from RT AT_USER mentioning alphabet tip the scales, with Google's URL mentioned. Again, no specifics on Alphabet's financials, but this is a common stock and tech-related terms might indicate investor interest.

3. Third tweet says Apple dries live TV plans for now, with a link to Google (GOOG). I don't know much about Apple's TV business or how it affects stock prices, so maybe not too helpful unless there's a trend in the company itself.

4. Fourth tweet talks about screen time through high-rated articles from tech companies and links to Apple, Google, FB, etc., again speculative without specifics on those stocks.

5. Fifth tweet discusses Amazon underperforming at $660 and Google at $750. This is specific and mentions actual stock prices. That seems like a concrete data point indicating if the stock price is currently below or above these thresholds.

6. Sixth tweet talks about Snapchat being back online after a outage tied to Google, in LA. Again, without more context on how this affects the stock, it's hard to assess unless there's a correlation between the event and the company.

Now, putting it together: The fifth tweet directly provides specific price levels for Amazon (AMZN) at $660 and Google (GOOG) at $750. This seems like an explicit data point that could influence investor sentiment positively if these thresholds are attractive or negative otherwise.

So, considering the last tweet gives exact prices, it's a significant event that might push the stock price either up or down depending on market expectations."
2015-12-10,Positive,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user has provided 10 tweets, but I'm not entirely sure about all the details. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

Starting with the first tweet: ""got nothing fangy going today , sold $ dwti overnight long . even though $ fb $ goog $ nflx $ amzn ought to bounce i ain ' … URL"". It seems like the user is selling some futures contracts, but it's not clear what they're shorting. The mention of ""fb"" and ""goog"" might indicate they're associated with Google or Facebook, which are tech companies. If these stocks are expected to bounce, that could be a positive outlook.

Second tweet: ""the not-so-secret secret is out of the bag , AT_USER announces raleigh office location : URL fiberiscoming $ goog"". This tweet mentions an announcement about the user's Facebook office location and then says something about Google. The mention of fiber being coming and Google's stock price could imply that investors are following Google, which might be a positive sign.

Third tweet: "" $ mkau join URL and connect ur $ fb $ twtr $ lnkd $ goog accounts for all in one social media cont … URL"". This seems like the user is joining multiple Twitter accounts to keep an eye on Google. This could indicate that the company's stock is being watched, which might lead to some positive sentiment.

Fourth tweet: ""xlp consumer staples select sector spdr shares URL $ xlp $ jnk $ goog $ xom xlp invest pennystocksxlu utilities …"". Here, the user is selling Tesla and joining a ETF. This could mean investors are rebalancing their portfolios, which might not be positive or negative.

Fifth tweet: ""sale hires $ goog exec , spike in cybermonday traffic . target $ 15 strong buy vs peers $ grpn $ quot URL $ pg $ ual $ mdlz"". The tweet mentions that the company hired executives and saw a spike in cybersecurity traffic. Targeting higher stock prices could be a positive indication for investors, expecting better performance.

Sixth tweet: ""chromecast audio adds support for hi-res audio , multi-room casting AT_USER $ goog URL URL"". The user is adding chromecast support to Google's services. This might mean that the product or service is getting more attention, which could boost demand and stock price.

Seventh tweet: ""bib proshares ultra nasdaq biotechnology summary URL $ bib $ eem $ gdxj $ goog bib tradeideas tradeideas"". The user is updating their profile with information from Proshares. This could indicate that the company's stock is being tracked by multiple analysts, which might lead to some positive sentiment.

Eighth tweet: ""rt AT_USER google $ goog ’ s verily creates new surgical company verb with johnson & johnson $ jnj URL URL"". The user mentions creating a new company for Johnson & Johnson. This could mean they're expanding into another sector, which might have long-term implications on the stock price.

Ninth tweet: ""tip ishares barclays tips bond fund news URL $ tip $ goog $ wmih $ qcom tip tradeideas pennystocks"". The user is updating their profile with information from Barclays. This could indicate that they're tracking Barclays' performance, which might not be positive or negative.

Tenth tweet: ""rt $ tsla hft algos triggered buy in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 09:05 , p / t 229.00 quant $ msft $ gpro $ goog $ amzn $ fb $ aapl $ nflx $ qqq"". The user mentions that Tesla is buying into a bond fund, which could mean investors are expecting higher interest rates or good economic performance.

Now, summarizing each tweet's impact:

1. Sells futures contracts and expects stocks to bounce – positive.
2. Announces location change for Google – could affect investor sentiment positively.
3. Joins multiple Twitter accounts to watch Google – might indicate a positive outlook.
4. Rebalancing portfolio – less clear on impact.
5. Hires executives with cybersecurity traffic spike – positive indication of strong performance.
6. Adds chromecast support – supports product development, which could boost demand.
7. Updating Proshares info – possibly related to stock research, leading to positive sentiment.
8. Creating a new company for Johnson & Johnson – expansion could influence the market.
9. Tracking Barclays – less clear impact.
10. Buy in bond fund from Tesla – more on interest rates or economic performance.

Overall, most tweets are pointing towards positive outcomes regarding Google, its competitors, and potential expansions. The bull signals from various sources suggest a strong outlook for the stock price."
2015-12-11,Neutral,"Alright, let's analyze these tweets to determine their impact on stock prices for a company, probably MSFT since it's mentioned in multiple tweets.

First tweet mentions stocks like AMZN and FB being bullish. That suggests good news for investors. Then the third tweet is similar but with ALPU. The fourth starts talking about AT_USER, which could be a typo or a placeholder. But it seems to mention that AT_USER's inventories are worse, which might signal negative sentiment. 

The fifth tweet says GPRO stocks are rising and Ciena dropping. That's interesting but not sure how it affects investors. The sixth and seventh tweets focus on high-rated tech stocks, suggesting overall positive news.

But the fourth tweet about AT_USER could confuse or maybe even manipulate the investor perception, especially if they're making a claim that could be seen as negative or misleading. However, other tweets are more straightforward and don't seem to contradict each other much.

Overall, some positive tweets like AMZN and FB, while conflicting with others, show mixed signals. The mixed information might make it hard to gauge the overall sentiment definitively. There's a bit of inconsistency, but most points lean towards bullish since they mention positive news on multiple stocks. 

Since there are conflicting but mostly positive tweets, it's challenging to assign a single sentiment tag. It seems like the market is somewhat bearish but influenced by positive momentum."
2015-12-12,Positive,"Okay, let's see what I need to do here. So, the task is to analyze these tweets and figure out their impact on the stock price of some company. The possible sentiments are positive, neutral, or negative.

First, looking at each tweet individually might help me understand the context better. The user has provided four tweets with specific content. Let's go through them one by one.

The first tweet is: ""$ tsts has gained 336.36 % in the past 2 weeks ! huge news : URL $ amzn $ mcox $ goog"". Hmm, it mentions a significant increase in TST stock and lists other stocks like AMZN, MCOX,goog. The wording here suggests that the user is telling me about a large event or update related to those companies.

The second tweet: ""$ goog received a new alert . find out why at URL stocks daytrading trading mkt nyse nasdaq markets 67"". This seems more technical, indicating that Google received an alert and wants me to figure out the reasons behind it. The numbers here are just URLs for the stock symbols and the exchanges they're traded on.

Third tweet: ""apple's ios 9.2 is here - - here's everything you're getting : URL $ aapl $ goog $ pcln $ k"". This one talks about Apple's iOS 9.2 update, which should be good news because Apple is a big company and the release of a major OS update could boost their stock price.

Fourth tweet: ""our stock alerts have seen incredible gains ! get exclusive early access to new picks : URL $ amzn $ mcox $ goog"". This again mentions Google and Microsoft stocks, with the idea that my alert system has made me eligible for some stock options or something. It's encouraging and seems positive about future prospects.

Now, looking at each tweet together. The first one is providing a general update on several companies, which might indicate good news but not necessarily specific to any one company. The second is technical, giving the user context without addressing specific stocks. The third focuses on Apple's product update, which would likely impact that company specifically. The fourth again gives positive news about Google and Microsoft.

I should consider what each tweet contributes to my information. The first tweet isn't very specific but mentions several companies. The second is technical. The third is more focused on a company (Apple). The fourth is positive for multiple companies as well.

When evaluating the overall impact, the key points are Apple's iOS update and Google getting an alert. These are significant events that could positively influence their respective stock prices. However, while these tweets do mention other stocks like MCOX in the first tweet, which might mean they're looking at broader market performance rather than a specific company.

Since the user is asking for the impact on ""the given company,"" I need to focus more on what's affecting that one company. Even though Apple and Google have their own updates, if the user wants to assess one specific stock, it's possible these tweets don't directly target that stock but might mention others around it.

But wait, perhaps the user is providing a list of stocks to monitor for potential gains or alerts. If they're telling me about other companies as well, maybe I'm supposed to consider if these are factors that could impact the specific company. Alternatively, if the tweets are just background information without targeting the target stock, it's harder to determine the sentiment.

However, since each tweet is somewhat related but not directly mentioning the target stock symbol, the overall sentiment might be a mix of positive and neutral because there's conflicting information. Apple's update seems important for one company, Google's alert affects others, which could indicate potential changes in investor sentiment across multiple companies.

But considering that the user provided these tweets as part of a larger context (like alerts or news related to specific stocks), perhaps it's intended to assess their impact on a particular stock. However, without knowing the exact target stock, it's challenging to assess the sentiment definitively.

In conclusion, since I don't have the exact target stock symbol, and each tweet mentions different companies with varying impacts, it's difficult to determine a clear overall sentiment. But if we consider that Apple is going through an update which could be positive for them, and Google has received an alert which might indicate a new opportunity or risk, the sentiments might balance out.

However, leaning more towards the fact that Apple's iOS update is significant enough to warrant attention, even if it's not directly targeting the specific stock in question. So maybe the overall sentiment is considered positive because of the potential for Apple and Google stocks, which could affect the given company if they are part of their portfolio."
2015-12-13,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price for cdii china direct industries inc. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock, cdiiChinaDirectInc. The first tweet is about their P/E ratio and some other companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, andTrade Ideas. These seem unrelated because they're discussing financial metrics and unrelated to cdii's business. So probably not much impact here.

Next, the second tweet talks about a healthcare services company with a lot of keywords: ahs amn healthcare services, current price on NASDAQ, and other related stocks. While this mentions their stock price, I don't see any positive or negative comments or analysis. It's just updating prices without sentiment. So maybe not significant.

The third tweet is about a bank in Karnataka, involving KTK Bank. It mentions stock symbols like $ktkbank.in and financial metrics from Google. Similar to the first tweet, this doesn't directly relate to cdii, so probably no impact on their stock price.

Finally, the fourth tweet is a link to ""see why these assets are trending"" and mentions stocks like Apple, Facebook, and Google again. It's more about trends and not specific information about cdii's stock. So that's also not relevant.

In summary, none of these tweets are directly discussing cdii or their stock price. The other tweets might be general updates on the broader market or unrelated sectors. Therefore, I don't see any positive, negative, or neutral impact here."
2015-12-14,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on TSLA stock. Let's go through each tweet step by step.

First, the user is asking for a response with the stock symbol extracted and an overall sentiment conclusion. The output should be one of [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

Looking at the tweets:

1. ""rt $ tsla hft algos triggered sell in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 09:37 , p / t 205.00 quant $ msft $ gpro $ goog $ amzn $ fb $ aapl $ nflx $ qqq""
   - The tweet mentions that a function call has triggered a sell in several platforms, which is negative. It also includes specific stock symbols for companies like MSFT, GPRO, GOOG, etc. This sounds like it's suggesting that TSLA isn't performing well due to other functions. So this is Negative.

2. ""apple music says will release taylor swift concert video december 20 $ aapl $ goog $ pcln $ k URL URL""
   - The tweet mentions a specific event for Apple Music related to Taylor Swift's concert in December 2020. This could be positive or neutral, depending on expectations about Apple's future performance and whether the concert is successful. However, it doesn't give clear information about TSLA.

3. ""apple music says will release taylor swift concert video december 20 : URL $ aapl $ goog $ pcln … URL""
   - Similar to tweet 2, this mentions an event for Apple Music but again without specifics on how it affects TSLA.

4. ""rt AT_USER trading the candlestick pattern toolbox ! trader $ spx $ qqq $ djia $ aapl $ tsla $ twtr $ fb $ goog URL""
   - The tweet is encouraging users to trade based on a tool called ""candlestick pattern toolbox."" While this could be seen as positive for TSLA's trading potential, it doesn't directly mention anything about the company's financial health or stock performance.

5. ""screen through high rated articles for us tech kings at once $ aapl $ goog $ fb URL URL""
   - This tweet suggests that users are reading top technical articles in the US tech sector. It might be positive if expected to impact TSLA's stock, but without more context on how these articles affect the company, it's ambiguous.

6. ""3,500 % gains in 5 months & a huge new pick is on the way ! get an exclusive first look : URL $ amzn $ mcox $ goog""
   - This tweet mentions significant gains and a new product launch, which could be positive for TSLA if the product is expected to boost revenue.

7. ""are u ready for the next bear market ? $ tvix $ vix $ uvxy $ vxx stocks daytrading nyse $ goog $ msft $ bac $ c $ jpm $ wmt $ fb $ twt $ ko $ mcd $ spx""
   - The tweet suggests waiting for a bear market, which could be negative if TSLA's stock is expected to decline.

8. ""rt AT_USER toys crafts $ twtr $ goog $ aapl games URL""
   - This tweet is encouraging users to engage in toys and crafts related to Google and Apple products. It doesn't directly affect TSLA, so it might not have a significant impact on the stock price.

9. ""alphabet ’ s verily ties up with johnson & johnson to develop robot surgeons $ goog $ googl $ jnj URL""
   - This tweet indicates that Alphabet is collaborating with Johnson & Johnson to develop robots for medical surgery. It's positive information, especially if it shows strong partnerships and potential growth.

Now, summarizing the factors from each tweet:

- Negative tweets: 1, 7
- Neutral or Positive tweets: 2, 8, 9

There are more negative tweets (tweets 1 and 7) than positive ones. Each negative tweet is making a statement that could negatively impact TSLA, like mentioning specific sales or an event that might affect the company's performance.

So overall sentiment seems Negative."

2015-12-17,Negative,"Alright, so I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for the given company. Let's start by breaking down what each tweet is saying.

The first tweet is ""rt AT_USER alphabet inc $ goog Stake reduced by braun stacey associates URL"". Hmm, okay. So, it seems like a user from AT_USER is talking about reducing their investment stake in Google using Braun Stacey Associates' URL. That sounds like they're taking control of a portion of Google stock that they previously owned.

Now, I'm thinking about how this affects investors. If someone is directly reducing their stakes in a major company like Google, which is considered significant by the financial markets, it can have a negative impact on their personal portfolio and, consequently, the overall stock price because other investors might be left holding more shares of the same stock.

Let me consider each tweet step by step. The first one mentions AT_USER reducing their stake in Google using Braun Stacey's URL. That seems like a direct action to sell or reduce ownership. I don't see any positive words here—nothing that suggests a gain or increase in their position. Instead, it's a removal of their stake.

Looking at the output requirement, I need to conclude with one of [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. The key here is understanding what each tweet implies about the impact on the stock price. Reducing your stake can lead to lower overall market sentiment because more people might hold onto other shares rather than selling them. This could cause a sell-off, which is negative for the stock price.

However, I also need to consider if the tweet is providing any information that's positive for AT_USER or Google. The mention of Braun Stacey Associates suggests they're managing or acquiring shares through them. But the main point is about reducing their own stake in Google. So, it's not necessarily a positive statement from AT_USER on Google.

Since the user is directly taking ownership out of Google stock, which is significant, it's likely causing a negative impact on Google's stock price. Investors might sell off their Google shares to free up Braun Stacey's shareholding, leading to a decline in overall sentiment and thus lower stock prices.

I should also think about other possible implications. Could this tweet be implying that the company is acquiring Braun Stacey? If so, that could lead to a negative impact as well. But from what's written, it seems focused on the user taking their stake out, not necessarily the acquisition of new shares.

In conclusion, the main takeaway is that the tweet directly reduces the number of shares the user has in Google, which can lead to selling pressure and a negative sentiment towards the company. Therefore, this tweet is likely to have a Negative impact."

2015-12-20,Negative,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and figure out if they'll impact the stock price positively, neutrally, or negatively. Let me start by going through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol from all the tweets: it seems like ""url.com"" is mentioned multiple times. I'll focus on that for analysis since it's the most relevant one here.

Now, looking at the first tweet: ""dig proshares ultra oil and gas prev close URL $ dig $ goog $ stev $ qld dig invest tradeideas"". The user mentions investing trends, tech companies like Google, ProShares, and Q西南都，which are all positive signs. Also, they're referencing things like Google stock prices, which could affect the company's performance. I think this tweet is showing a general interest in stocks and tech, so it might not have a strong positive impact yet.

The second tweet: ""gain from movement in these buzzing assets greferendum $ eurusd $ goog $ spx $ usdjpy URL URL"". It talks about assets like EUR, USDP, EUPY. These could influence the currency or asset prices, which might affect the stock price indirectly by changing market conditions. But it's not a very strong positive or negative statement.

The third tweet: ""rt AT_USER what to make of bcg's new 50 most innovative companies list URL tesla $ aapl $ goog"". It's mentioning Tesla and Apple, both of which are significant companies. This could potentially boost the stock price if the company under the(bcG) strategy is performing well. However, it's more about speculation than actual analysis.

Putting it all together: The tweet focuses on upcoming tech companies and stock symbols like Tesla and Google. While it shows a positive note with investments in tech companies, it doesn't provide any concrete information that would directly impact the stock price. It might be encouraging but not conclusive evidence."
2015-12-21,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for Google. 

First, I'll need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the tweets:

1. $ goog needs to take out $ 759 . wedge forming : URL
2. good morning traders welcome new followers . $ rlyp valtessa sales starting early ! private twitter alerts URL $ goog $ amzn
3. dow etfs could get some new additions in 2016 URL etf indexing $ dia $ aapl $ goog $ djd
4. surf is this kelly slater's new wave on google earth ? - … URL google $ goog $ googl URL

Hmm, the target stock symbols here are ""goog"" for each one. So I'll focus on these.

Now, I need to break down each tweet into positive and negative factors. 

Looking at the first tweet: ""$ goog needs to take out $ 759 . wedge forming : URL"". It mentions removing a fee and possibly removing some content. That seems like it could affect investor sentiment negatively because reducing fees might make the stock more affordable, but I'm not sure about the wedge forming part.

Second tweet: ""good morning traders welcome new followers . $ rlyp valtessa sales starting early ! private twitter alerts URL $ goog $ amzn"". This suggests they're adding value by featuring a new product or service (rlyp and valtessa), attracting more followers, and providing alerts. Positive factors here could lead to increased revenue and stock performance.

Third tweet: ""dow etfs could get some new additions in 2016 URL etf indexing $ dia $ aapl $ goog $ djd"". It mentions the return of an old idea (etfs) and potential additions from 2016. This could be positive if it's bringing in more funds, but I'm not sure about the significance or context.

Fourth tweet: ""surf is this kelly slater's new wave on google earth ? - … URL google $ goog $ googl URL"". It seems to suggest a project involving Kelly Slater on Google Earth. This could be speculative and might have both positive and negative implications depending on how it performs.

Now, assessing the sentiment from each tweet: 

1. Negative factor (fee removal) + Other factors like wedge forming? Maybe moderate negative.
2. Positive factors (new product, added value). Strong positive.
3. Return of money + speculative project. Could be mixed but leaning towards positive if the addition is successful.
4. Speculative content on Google Earth. I'm not sure about this one; it could have both sides.

Overall, considering that tweet 2 is very positive with clear benefits, and tweet 1 is somewhat negative without more context, it's hard to say. But overall, there are strong positive factors outweighing the minor negatives."
2015-12-22,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the company in question. The user provided some tweets and instructions to analyze them into positive, negative, or neutral impacts.

First, looking at tweet 1: ""report : google , ford forming self-driving car jv $ goog $ googl $ f URL"". It mentions Google and Ford making a moving target with a self-driving car. That's a good sign because self-driving cars are emerging and attracting investment interest. This could boost the overall sentiment.

Next, tweet 2: ""$ aapl $ fb $ twtr $ baba $ xom $ cvx $ mon $ ibm $ amzn $ goog $ msft $ cl_f $ nq_f $ es_f $ ym_f URL up-to-date chart analysis"". This seems to be about stock performance and includes various stocks. The mention of Google's stock price could indicate that investors are focused on the company, which might be positive.

Tweet 3: ""bac bank of america corp . ask size URL $ bac $ spxl $ goog $ qid bac investing stockmarket"". Here, it mentions Bank of America as an investment, but the specific tweet doesn't seem to have any direct financial details or positive statements about a company. It's more about their activities without specifics on the target stock.

Tweet 4: ""crazy fruits $ aapl foodporn foodie $ twtr $ goog apple URL URL"". This seems out of context. The word ""foodporn"" is probably a typo or a meme, suggesting some sort of promotion for Apple, but there's no clear connection to any specific stock in this tweet.

Tweet 5: ""$ mu micron technology , inc . day low URL $ mu $ xlb $ goog $ aa mu stockmarket"". This mentions Micron Technology and their stock performance. It says they're down a bit but still considered good investment opportunities, which might be neutral because it's uncertain if the stock will recover.

Finally, tweet 6 repeats tweet 1: ""report : google , ford forming self-driving car jv $ goog $ googl $ f URL"". This is redundant with tweet 1 and continues the positive trend of tech stocks like Google facing a slowdown in self-driving cars.

So, putting it all together, tweets 1, 2, and 6 are reinforcing the idea that Google's AI is moving ahead, which is good for investors. However, tweet 5 shows Micron Technology is down but still a possibility for recovery. The overall sentiment seems positive because of the strong tech sector moves."
2015-12-23,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price. I'm not too familiar with all the terms used in finance, but I'll do my best.

First, looking at each tweet, they seem to be discussing various topics related to tech companies. Some mention companies like EGRX, GOOG, TUSPY, etc., which are known in the tech industry. 

Starting with tweet 1: It mentions EGRX and some other stocks, but there's a typo with ""h hindpetro.in."" I'll assume that's a typo for ""hindpetro"" or maybe a different company. The main thing is it's talking about a change in URLs related to GOOG (Google). 

Tweet 2 talks about Google having the best holiday e-card in 2015 and then links to Google's URL. That seems like a positive sign because more people might be interested in Google products, which can boost their stock price.

Tweet 3 is similar to tweet 2; it also mentions GOOG and links to its URL but seems redundant since tweet 2 already covers that topic. Maybe it's just a repetition or another way of reaching out for info.

Tweet 4 talks about Supertrades buying a freakin' house with their recent win, using terms like ! ! and $ mbly. The exclamation points are pretty intense, which usually makes people buy stocks, so this could be a positive note affecting investor sentiment.

Tweet 5 is about Apple's tax charges being 'total political crap.' That sounds negative because negative news can cause investors to sell their stocks. This could lead to a decrease in demand for companies like TwTR and APLY.

Tweet 6 discusses Apple's tax-related issues but adds other companies involved, including things like ARPI and others. The mention of ""total political crap"" is the same as tweet 5, so it reinforces the negative sentiment here too. Investors probably don't look good when there are such negative comments.

Tweet 7 mentions Blackberry wanting a piece of the driverless car market but uses some company names like CLRN. This seems more tech-related and could be seen as a positive sign because companies that drive the market positively might perform well.

Lastly, tweet 8 is about Alphabet Inc. building social robots for their Facebook challenge, which is a tech innovation that can have positive implications on their stock price.

Now, summarizing each tweet's impact:

1. The typo might not affect much, but EGRX and GOOG seem relevant.
2. Positive from Google e-card and strong ties to GOOG.
3. No significant information beyond what's in tweet 2.
4. Strong positive note about Supertrades buying property.
5. Negative from Apple's tax issues causing investor sell pressure.
6. Same as tweet 5 but covers more companies, reinforces negative sentiment.
7. Positive because Blackberry's position could affect tech growth.
8. Positive for Alphabet's AI-related innovation.

Looking at all these, the main positive tweets are 4 and 7 and 8. The negative ones are 2, 5, and 6. Although tweet 3 is redundant with tweet 2, it doesn't add new info. 

So overall sentiment seems positive because multiple positive tweets reinforce each other, while the negatives don't outweigh the positives enough to make a significant impact on the stock price."
2015-12-24,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to determine the impact on the stock price based on these tweets. First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. The first tweet mentions Waze and Google's potential role in a self-driving car war with Uber. So, the target stock is likely G.OOGL, which is Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL).

Now, looking at each tweet:

1. The first one talks about Waze potentially being Google's ace in a self-driving car battle with Uber. That sounds like it could be positive because if other companies are getting caught up, Google might still have a strategic position.

2. The second tweet just states the URL for Google. URLs don't typically provide information on stock sentiment, so I can ignore this one unless there's an implied message, which doesn't seem likely here.

3. The third tweet is also about Waze and Google in their fight with Uber. Similar to the first tweet, it reinforces the idea that even if others are involved, Google might still have a strategic advantage.

Since both tweets mention Google as a potential competitor or competitor factor, they're pointing towards Google's position being significant enough that investors might see positive trends. Therefore, combining these factors, I think the stock is likely to be positively impacting."
2015-12-25,Neutral,"Alright, I need to determine the impact on the stock price of the given company based on the provided tweets. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll extract the target stock from each tweet. In this case, all tweets mention ""goog"", so the stock is Google. 

Next, for each tweet, I'll separate into positive and negative factors. For example, in tweet 1, they calculate a 21-day expected return of 0.1%, which seems neutral because it's just an expected value, not a recommendation.

In tweet 2, it mentions hardware and cloud computing having an inverse relationship with Google stocks. This suggests that if one goes up, the other might go down, but I'm not sure how this affects Google's overall performance yet.

Tweet 3 talks about identifying the top 50 innovative companies from 2015 and links them to Google. While tech innovation is good, it doesn't directly impact Google's current performance or future prospects unless there are changes in company culture or growth potential, which I don't see here.

Tweets 4 and 5 focus on ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) related to Google. These are financial instruments that trade assets like stocks, but without specific information about the funds' returns or trends, it's hard to gauge their impact on the stock price directly.

Putting this together, while some tweets suggest potential relationships or trends with other tech companies, none provide direct information about Google's performance or future direction. The most significant factor might be the 21-day expected return being low, which doesn't inherently indicate good or bad news for the company. So overall sentiment seems neutral."
2015-12-26,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of xrt spdr s & p retail index. Let me take it step by step.

First, I have two tweets to analyze. The target is the S&P Retail Index (SPRT). 

Looking at tweet 1: ""xrt spdr s & p retail index stock message board URL $ xrt $ twm $ spxl $ goog xrt stock investing"". Hmm, this seems like a link request or an offer. It mentions SPRT, so maybe the tweet is informing the user about something related to SPRT. I'm not sure if this directly affects investors. Maybe it's just a way to communicate news about SPRT.

Now, tweet 2: ""rt AT_USER would love to see $ goog spin off a low float tracking stock of youtube . someone needs to introduce larry page to john malon …"". This one looks more serious. It mentions Google (GOOG) and refers to introducing LARRY PAGE to J ohn MALON. I'm guessing that means they're looking to take out Larry Page, who is the co-founder of Google, from a tracking stock on YouTube. If that's happening, it might affect investors because Larry Page's exit could lead to changes in Google's strategy and possibly revenue, which can influence the stock price.

Considering both tweets: The first one seems like an informational link or message board, not necessarily affecting the stock directly. The second tweet is more significant as it suggests a strategic move related to Google, which could have broader implications on the stock market.

I should assess each tweet's impact. The first might be neutral if just trying to reach out without impacting investors. The second seems negative because it could negatively affect Google or its stock, which in turn would impact SPRT. So overall, I think it's a Negative sentiment."
2015-12-27,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of a company. I have four tweets in front of me, and each seems to relate to different aspects of a potential investment. 

First, looking at tweet 1: It mentions CP Canadian Railway and refers to ""URL $ cp $ sune $ goog $ pbr cp invest nasdaq."" This looks like an attempt to post some kind of link or message on a finance website related to NASDAQ. The mention of Google (GOOG) seems positive because it's often linked with tech companies, which can be seen as a good sign in the stock market.

Next, tweet 2 says: ""rt AT_USER barron's says youtube could be worth $100b. google paid $1.65b to buy it 9 years ago. goog."" Here, Google is mentioned again, along with some numbers about YouTube's value over a decade ago. The fact that Google has a history of buying smaller companies in the past can indicate growth and potential expansion, which might be positive for investors.

Tweet 3: ""URL <- want to make $600k in one year trading ? check out how this guy did it ! goog $ pcln $ vtae."" The user is suggesting they're looking to invest $600k in a trade. This seems like an investment opportunity, which could be good for the stock price if the company takes on risk.

Finally, tweet 4: ""instant analysis : apple inc . inks an exclusive contract with taylor swift : url $ aapl $ goog $ … url."" Apple is mentioned along with Taylor Swift's music. While Apple has been involved in partnerships and contracts, especially with big companies like Google, the mention of Taylor Swift might not have a direct impact on the stock price unless it ties into company performance or brand exposure.

Now, let me break down each tweet's factors:

1. Positive: The mention of NASDAQ is positive.
2. Neutral: The link to Google seems neutral because it's just another way to talk about tech companies.
3. Neutral: The suggestion for a $600k investment could be seen as either neutral or slightly positive, depending on the context.
4. Negative: While Apple's partnerships are often good, Taylor Swift isn't typically an indicator of company performance.

Combining these, tweet 1 is positive because it relates to Google which can be a good sign. Tweet 2 adds more support for Google by mentioning its past investments, so that reinforces the positive aspect. Tweet 3 suggests investment, which could boost the stock price but might depend on factors like market interest and the company's fundamentals.

So overall, the main positive points are from tweets 1, 2, and 4. However, tweet 4 has some negative elements because it's referencing a specific partnership with Taylor Swift, which isn't commonly tied to tech stocks. But still, it adds value in the broader sense of investing.

Considering all these factors, I think the overall sentiment is positive because Google is heavily referenced, Apple could be a positive aspect if the company is doing well, and there are investment opportunities suggested. The negative element from tweet 4 might not outweigh the positives."
2015-12-28,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a given company. The user provided two tweets, and they want me to conclude whether each is positive, neutral, or negative.

First, looking at tweet 1: It mentions that FANG's return for 2015 is significant with percentages like +34% FB, +115% AMZN, etc., along with an average. This seems like a positive statement because it highlights strong growth percentages and includes an average which adds credibility to the claim. The mention of $ fb suggests financial figures, so this tweet sounds positive about FANG's performance in 2015.

Now, tweet 2 talks about AT_USER asking why Google shut down its dedicated European VC fund and links it to the URL. This is a negative statement because it indicates dissatisfaction or concern from users, which can affect investor sentiment negatively. Such concerns usually reduce confidence in the company's future performance.

Combining both tweets, the first one is clearly positive pointing towards strong financial results, while the second adds negative pressure due to user feedback. However, the positive tweet supports a potential upturn, counteracting some of the negative情绪 from the second tweet. So overall, the sentiment might be leaning more positive than neutral or negative."
2015-12-29,Positive,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a given company. Let's see, the user provided several tweets and wants an analysis.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking through each tweet, it seems they all mention ""GOOG"" in some capacity, like ""goog,"" ""gaming,"" or ""alphabet inc."" So I'll take GOOG as the target company.

Next, I have to analyze each tweet step by step. The process is outlined: separate factors into positive and negative, assess sentiment, and then combine them overall.

Let's go through each tweet:

1. **rt AT_USER stocks hitting all-time highs today : $ goog & $ googl $ mcd $ amzn $ rcl $ dps $ sjm URL**
   - Positive factors here are things like GOOG and companies like MCD (Microsoft), AMZN (Amazon), RCL (RedCard communications) having hit highs.
   - The negative factors mentioned aren't explicitly listed, but the use of money symbols indicates positive mentions, which might be seen as favorable.

2. **rt AT_USER fang return for 2015 is : $ fb + 34 % $ amzn + 115 % $ nflx + 134 % $ goog + 45 % * * * avg : + 82 % * * * via AT_USER**
   - Positive factors: FB, AMZN, NFLX (which is XOM), and GOOG are all mentioned with percentages.
   - Negative factors: The asterisks might indicate negative sentiment or unknown factors.

3. **fyi $ goog r still grimy , sneaky , bastards . that will never change . URL**
   - Positive: The comment about GOOG staying grim might suggest mixed feelings, but it's mostly positive in terms of content.
   - Negative: Words like ""grimy,"" ""sneaky,"" and ""bastards"" are negative. However, the URL is unclear if it's a typo or direct link.

4. **rt AT_USER stocks hitting all-time highs today : $ goog & $ googl $ mcd $ amzn $ rcl $ dps $ sjm URL**
   - Similar to tweet 1, GOOG and its derivatives are positive.

5. **rt AT_USER stocks that set new record closing highs today : $ goog , $ googl , $ amzn , $ rcl , $ k , $ mcd , $ dps , $ kmb , $ tmo . URL**
   - Again, multiple positives for GOOG and related companies.

6. **google : transforming the messenger URL $ fb $ goog $ googl URL**
   - Positive: The mention of ""transforming the messenger"" could be seen as positive, suggesting progress or innovation in tech.

7. **tesla ramps up hiring in face of automotive threats from apple , others "" $ goog $ tsla $ aapl URL**
   - Positive: The focus on hiring for addressing future challenges shows proactive thinking, which can influence investor sentiment positively.

8. **these were the most trafficked tech apps of 2015 $ fb $ goog $ amzn $ twtr techapps tech startups URL**
   - Positive factors here include FB and GOOG being popular, suggesting good market presence.

9. **$ goog $ googl : alphabet inc ( goog ) insists google glass project is not dead , and … : URL**
   - Positive: The statement about the Google Glass project shows a strong commitment to innovation and investment in projects that could benefit the company.

Putting it all together, all tweets are positive or mixed in terms of sentiment. They mention growth in tech companies, specific stocks like GOOG being discussed frequently. There's no clear indication of negative information, but some tweets seem a bit speculative with terms like ""grimy,"" ""bastards,"" and potential upcoming projects.

Therefore, the overall sentiment is positive because most factors are favorable to GOOG performance, and there's a focus on growth and innovation."
2015-12-30,Neutral,"Okay, I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of cdii celgene corp. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

First tweet: It's about some stocks setting new record highs with $ goog and others. This seems positive because it's showing strong trading volumes and higher prices. Positive factors are there.

Second tweet: Talks about alphabet inc., which is a tech giant. Trading on both NYMNT and EEM, so buying could be positive. The mention of class C might indicate growth opportunities. So the overall sentiment here is positive because the stock is being bought up.

Third tweet: Talks about AT_USER stocks hitting all-time highs with multiple closing prices. More selling pressure, but also some technical indicators like momentum and MACD may indicate strong trends. However, without knowing the current price relative to others, it's hard to say if this is a positive or negative event on cdii itself.

Fourth tweet: US stocks needing fang for them to keep marching higher. FANG companies are often booming. This could boost stock prices as they see strength from such stocks. The words like FB and AMZN suggest tech stocks are up, so positive factors here.

Fifth tweet: Another set of high points with $ goog and others, similar to the first one. Positive trading signals, so selling pressure is increasing but no immediate negatives noted.

Sixth tweet: Updating the stock exchange data, which might affect market sentiment if other participants adjust their buying or selling behavior based on new information.

Putting it all together, the main factors are strong price actions and positive mentions of companies like FB, AMZN, etc. However, some tweets are about technicals rather than direct company performance. The overall trend seems mixed with some strong signals but also potential technical issues without concrete details on cdii's current position."
2015-12-31,Positive,"Alright, so I need to analyze these tweets about a company's stock price impact. The user provided seven tweets and wants me to determine whether each is positive, neutral, or negative in their effect on the stock.

First, looking at tweet 1: It mentions screen taking high rated articles for tech companies like Apple, Google, etc., specifically mentioning webpage URLs. While this could be a good sign about the company's current performance, it's more about their current activities than their future outlook or impact on stock price. So probably not positive overall.

Next, tweet 2 talks about Amazon having the fastest-growing web properties in 2015 and mentions other companies like Google and VZ (Vanguard index). This is a positive sign because growth usually supports investor confidence, which can be a good sign for stock prices. But I'm unsure if it's enough to outweigh other factors or just one point.

 Tweet 3 discusses HD Home Depot. While this company has been involved in the real estate market, it's more about their current operations rather than a positive trend that would influence future stock price growth. It might be neutral because there's not much direction yet.

Tweet 4 is about anfi up 8% on a $92m contract. That's a positive news related to revenue and stock performance. The company's ability to secure large contracts can boost investor confidence, which can contribute positively to the stock price.

Tweet 5 mentions a ""classic big win"" by AT_USER with Apple, JCP, Tasmal, and Google. This is another positive story about success in the tech sector, which typically leads to increased revenues and stock prices. It adds more to the overall positive outlook.

Tweet 6 talks about FitFit, providing eod data via QuantConnect. While this could indicate good market performance or user engagement, it's a specific service related to fitness and not directly related to the company's broader performance metrics. So maybe neutral since it's niche information rather than a general trend affecting stock price.

Tweet 7 is about KidsBelike cool kids products, targeting middle- downtrodden communities. This seems like a positive announcement because it's about customer satisfaction and product growth. Positive customer feedback can boost sales and reduce risks for investors, contributing to a positive overall sentiment.

Now, compiling all these thoughts: There are several positive tweets (4,5,7), some neutral (3), and one negative (1). However, the most impactful factors seem to be the success stories in key areas like real estate, e-commerce growth, and customer satisfaction. These tend to have a stronger influence on stock price movements than just individual company news or specific events.

Putting it all together, these positive factors suggest that the overall sentiment is likely Positive."
