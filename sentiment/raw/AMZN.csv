2014-01-01,Negative,"Alright, let's figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on Apple's stock price. The user provided two tweets and wants me to determine if each is positive, negative, or neutral in terms of affecting Apple's future stock price.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet: ""apple screwed up big time URL $ amzn $ aapl"". So, it seems like there are two symbols here: AMZN and APEL (though that doesn't make sense for an ETF; maybe a typo). Apple's symbol is likely ""AMZN"", so I'll focus on AMZN.

Now, each tweet needs to be analyzed individually. 

In the first tweet: ""apple screwed up big time URL $ amzn $ aapl"". The words here are ""apple"" and ""screwed up big time URL"". ""Screwed up big time"" seems like negative feedback, which could indicate investor concern about Apple's performance or future prospects. The presence of both AMZN and APEL suggests something might be wrong with the tweet but is unclear in context.

For the second tweet: ""apple screwed up big time$ youtube $ apple"". Again, ""screwed up big time"" again adds negative sentiment. ""YouTube"" could be a typo for ""Tevor"" or another company, which would be speculative. The overall message is reinforcing concern about Apple's future performance.

Combining both tweets: Both show Apple facing some issues with negative feedback, so the overall sentiment is negative."
2014-01-02,Negative,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, I need to figure out how these tweets impact the stock price of a company. The user provided two tweets and wants me to determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative towards the stock.

First, for each tweet, I should identify the target stock symbol. Looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER several incredible novels to help you to turbo-charge your kindle ! URL $ amzn bestsellers books ( vi …"". It seems like it's mentioning Amazon and other Amazon-related products, so the target stock is AMZN.

The second tweet is ""$ amzn is getting on my nerves . so much for that 400"". This clearly mentions Amazon, which reinforces the target stock as AMZN. So both tweets are about AMZN.

Now, I need to analyze each tweet. For the first one: ""rt AT_USER..."" seems like a positive action but also includes some negative emojis like ! and … which might suggest frustration or disappointment. However, it's part of a longer message related to Amazon novels, so perhaps it's a mix of support and criticism.

The second tweet is more direct: ""so much for that 400"". The phrase ""so much for that 400"" could mean frustration about the stock price dropping by 400 points or something similar. It feels like a strong negative sentiment here, as it's a significant disappointment.

Putting this together, the first tweet is somewhat positive but also contains negative elements, while the second is very strongly negative. However, since both tweets are pointing to AMZN and the user is reacting negatively in the second one, maybe the overall impact is more negative because the stock isn't just being praised but actually receiving a significant hit.

But wait, I should consider if there's any overlap or context. The first tweet doesn't mention negative indicators like earnings reports, earnings calls, etc., so it might be more of a general sentiment. But both tweets are about Amazon, which is a major stock. Therefore, the negative sentiment in the second tweet probably has a bigger impact on the overall stock price.

So, weighing the two tweets: one slightly positive but includes negatives, and another clearly negative with a big price drop. The strong negative in the second tweet likely leads to a Negative overall sentiment."
2014-01-03,Positive,"Alright, let's try to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. The user provided two tweets and wants me to determine whether they'll positively affect, have no effect, or negatively impact the stock.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""the first employees at google , amazon and subway share stories of the companies ' early days : URL $ goog $ amzn"". This seems like a positive statement about the early stages of these companies. Early-stage companies often have higher growth potential because they're more innovative and can benefit from new technologies or market trends. So this tweet is likely to be supportive.

Next, the second tweet: ""rbc top 3 internet longs for 2014 : $ goog ( best play on online advertising ); $ amzn ( best play on online retail ); $ ebay ( poised for rebound )"". Here, it's talking about RBC holding the top three competitors in the US market for the year 2014. The tweet mentions how each company is performing in their respective sectors: online advertising and retail are key areas for internet growth, while e-commerce like eBay might be poised for rebound because of increased demand.

So putting this together, both tweets are providing positive insights into the early stages of Google, Amazon, and possibly eBay. They also outline which companies are strong performers in specific industries during that time. All these factors point towards a positive outlook on the company's stock price as they have beneficial information about their growth prospects and market potential.

Therefore, considering all this, I think the overall sentiment is Positive."
2014-01-04,Missing,File not found
2014-01-05,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, the target stock is AMZN, which is Amazon. Each tweet has something related to Bezos, the CEO, but also mentions other things like Galapagos, rescued in some countries, and some financial terms.

Starting with the first tweet: ""$ amzn amazons bezos airlifted off galapagos in health scare URL"". It mentions bringing people from Galápagos island to be with Amazon. I know Bezos has been involved in environmental issues before, especially in global climate change efforts. This could be seen as a positive signal because it's showing his involvement in community initiatives and environmental causes. So this tweet seems like it could be good for the stock.

Next is ""$ amzn amazons bezos rescued by ecuador navy due to kidney stone - report URL"". It looks like Bezos was rescued from a kidney stone and now is benefiting from their country's navy. This might have some positive connotations, perhaps about his recovery or support within the community. But it's also justifiable if it's a joke or maybe a humorous note.

Third tweet: ""$ amzn amazons bezos rescued by ecuador navy due to kidney stone : report URL"". It seems similar to the previous one but uses a colon instead of a dash, which might imply more seriousness. Maybe he's being considered for something serious, which could be seen as positive if it reflects his character or community approach.

Fourth tweet: ""bezos airlifted from cruise after kidney stone attack URL $ amzn"". This looks like Bezos was lifted off the cruise after an attack on a kidney stone. It seems to focus on his recovery and not on business performance, so this might be seen as neutral or even negative if it's taken out of context without more details.

Fifth tweet: ""$ at_user sunday links : reflexive buybacks , economic optimism & short vs long-term thinking URL $ amzn $ goog $ fb"". This seems like a link to some articles about Amazon's buybacks, economic optimism, and different investment strategies. It could be positive if it relates to company performance or future growth prospects. It might also suggest Bezos is making strategic moves, which could affect the stock.

Now I need to assess each tweet individually:
1. The first tweet has a clear mention of environmental efforts; good.
2. Second tweet humorously suggests recovery from a kidney stone, which isn't necessarily positive for the stock but shows some positive aspects within the company.
3. Third tweet is slightly more serious, possibly indicating support or focus, so it's positive too.
4. Fourth tweet doesn't talk about AMZN performance; negative context.
5. Fifth tweet looks like it could be positive with topics around buybacks and economic outlook.

Overall, most tweets are either positive about Bezos' personal ventures or related to his business strategies. The negative ones are the fourth one, but that's not directly impacting Amazon's stock price. So overall sentiment seems mixed but leans mostly positive."
2014-01-06,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to analyze the given tweets to determine their likely impact on the future stock price of Apple Inc., represented by the symbol APLX or something similar. The user provided three tweets and asked for an analysis of their impact.

First, I'll look at each tweet individually and break them down into positive (APL) and negative factors, then assess sentiment based on that.

1. The first tweet is ""rt AT_USER 9 bar charts : apple vs . amazon vs . google URL $ amzn $ goog only market sentiment killing $ aapl ceo."" It mentions comparing Apple's performance with Amazon and Google using bar charts. There's a mention of the $ AMZN (Apple) stock price being down and the CEO candidate. This is definitely positive because it shows investor interest in Apple and supports their financial health, which can be seen as good news.

2. The second tweet is ""$ amzn wall street breakfast : must-know news [ URL inc . , jpmorgan chase ... URL."" It looks like a link to some recent articles or news on Amazon. The sentiment here is uncertain because it depends on the content of those links. If they're positive, Apple could benefit; if negative, there might be a downside.

3. The third tweet is ""amazon tax expands to 3 more states - msn money URL via AT_USER $ amzn."" It's talking about expanding Amazon's taxes in three additional states. This is definitely a negative factor because it can increase Amazon's costs and reduce profit margins for Apple, which might affect their stock price.

Now, combining these factors:

- Positive: The first tweet suggests market sentiment is positive with CEO candidates.
- Neutral: Second tweet is speculative without content.
- Negative: Third tweet directly affects Amazon, a major competitor to Apple.

The overall sentiment seems mixed. There are both positive and negative signals. Apple has strong support from the CEO candidate in one tweet but faces increased costs from Amazon due to tax expansions. This makes the stock price uncertain, leading me to conclude it's neutral."
2014-01-07,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative for Amazon's stock price impact. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First tweet: ""if $ amzn starts accepting bitcoin ,bitcoin will go to $ 2000 overnight ."" This seems like a prediction or outlook about Bitcoin increasing in value. It suggests that if Amazon accepts Bitcoin, it could spike to $2000 overnight. That sounds speculative and potentially positive because if Amazon is willing to take on more risk for Bitcoin's price appreciation, there might be increased demand. So this could boost Amazon's stock.

Second tweet: ""rt AT_USER build a mini long-short portfolio with these 6 high-priced shares URL $ aamc $ aapl $ amzn $ brk . a $ tprp $ …"" This looks like the user is setting up a mini portfolio using their favorite stocks. They're suggesting that Amazon might be considered for a short-term investment in some of its high-priced shares. While this could affect Amazon's stock price by increasing investor interest or sentiment, it seems more about strategy than predicting a specific outcome. So maybe not as strong as the first tweet.

Third and fourth tweets are blank except for URLs without any meaningful content. They don't provide information that can be analyzed into factors or sentiment. Since they're just URLs, I can't extract anything useful from them. Therefore, these tweets aren't contributing to any analysis on Amazon's stock price impact.

Putting it all together: The first tweet is positive because it's a forward-looking statement about Bitcoin. The other two are just setup suggestions without content to influence sentiment. So overall, the sentiment seems positive based on the first tweet."
2014-01-08,Positive,"Okay, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

First, tweet 1 mentions an exclusive deal with CBS for 'extant' URL. That seems like it could be a typo or irrelevant, so probably not affecting the stock negatively.

Tweets 2-6 are all about AMZN getting a video subscriber gain from Comcast in Q4. The user is talking about increased subscribers, which usually means more customers, which can boost stock prices. The last tweet mentions $AMZN and comcast's subscriber gains sending the stock up. So these tweets are positive indicators.

Since multiple positive tweets are contributing positively to Amazon's performance, overall sentiment is positive."
2014-01-09,Positive,"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price and then decide if it's positive, neutral, or negative. 

First, looking at the task, I see that each tweet is about Amazon's workforce growth. The user mentions a tripled workforce in three years, which is significant for tech companies. That sounds like good news because more people are joining the company, attracting talent and resources.

Now, let me go through each tweet:

1. ""rt AT_USER amazon's workforce has tripled in 3 years , growing faster than other tech giants . URL $ amzn URL"" - This seems positive about their growth. High expectations for future success could boost sentiment.
2. ""so we have to wait until feb 4 to find out if all this poor retail is bc of $ amzn . earnings"" - Here, they're talking about doubts about the company's performance based on earnings. That might lead people to doubt Amazon, which could be negative.
3. Same as tweet 1. Another positive note about their growth.
4. ""internet stocks : double top ? $ spy , $ spx , $ es_f , $ fdn , $ goog , $ amzn URL"" - This mentions a double top in the S&P 500, which is a technical analysis indicator of market strength, so this could be positive for investors.
5. ""rt AT_USER amazon's workforce has tripled in 3 years , growing faster than other tech giants . URL $ amzn URL"" - Repeating the same tweet, reinforcing positivity.
6. Same as tweet 1, just a slightly different wording but still positive.
7. ""very pleased that i'm still holding my $ bidu runners . long $ amzn $ aapl short $ cme"" - This seems like a balanced statement with both support and caution on Amazon, maybe indicating uncertainty or cautious optimism. It's neutral in sentiment.
8. Same as tweet 1. Positive note again.
9. ""rt AT_USER a look inside amazon's rigorous hiring program : URL $ amzn URL"" - While not directly about the company, mentioning a hiring program is good for employees and can boost morale. This could be positive because a strong culture might attract more talent.
10. Same as tweet 9.
11. ""the dirty little secret about 4k streaming : content owners can't afford the bandwidth costs URL $ amzn $ nflx $ cmcsa"" - This one is about 4K streaming and costs. It's unclear how this affects Amazon unless it's a competitor or related. Given that it's technical, I'm not sure if it directly impacts Amazon's stock.
12. Same as tweet 1. Positive note.

Now, compiling the sentiment from these tweets: most are positive about growth, some mention stock indices which is neutral (double top), one mentions a hiring program which could be good for morale, and two talk about costs which might not directly relate unless they're competitors or related products.

Overall, the positive tweets suggest increasing confidence in Amazon's future success. The neutral tweet about the double top might signal support but without context on market conditions. The hiring program is speculative but could be seen as a strong point. However, one tweet is uncertain and doesn't directly impact Amazon's performance.

So, considering these factors, it seems like there's enough positive sentiment to outweigh any negatives. Therefore, the overall sentiment leans towards [Positive]."
2014-01-10,Neutral,"Okay, let's try to figure out how these tweets impact the stock price for Amazon. First, I need to identify each tweet's factors and determine if they're positive or negative.

Looking at the first tweet: It mentions finding a resume from a senior executive in their e-commerce resume. That seems positive because resumes are usually seen as a good asset for companies. So this is likely a positive factor.

The second tweet talks about the user thinking something will break tomorrow. If someone thinks an event will change, it might lead to uncertainty or speculative actions. So maybe a positive or neutral sentiment here?

Third tweet: The user mentions exiting a money portfolio and covering losses in two other stocks. This looks like potential loss of capital, which could be negative.

Fourth tweet is about bad sales at Amazon and related companies. That seems like a strong negative factor because bad sales would lower revenue, affecting the stock price negatively.

Now, summarizing these factors: Two positive things (finding resume and exiting portfolio), one neutral or speculative thought (thinking something will break), and three negative thoughts from sales issues. Since there are both positive and negative sentiments, it's hard to say for sure if the overall impact is positive, neutral, or negative. Maybe the sentiment is mixed because of conflicting opinions."
2014-01-11,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative for a stock's future price impact. Let me start by breaking down the steps given.

First, I have to identify the target stock from each tweet. Hmm, looking at the first tweet: ""$ amzn URL consolidation in a zone , looks good over 406"". The word 'Amazon' seems to be involved here. So I think that's Amazon, Inc., the company we're focusing on.

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. Let me go through them one by one.

1. ""$ amzn URL consolidation in a zone , looks good over 406"" – This seems like it's talking about something related to Amazon's website or the site they're consolidating. The phrase ""URL consolidation in a zone"" might indicate that there's an improvement, which is positive. It also says ""looks good over 406,"" so maybe that number relates to some metric, possibly the stock price? That would be a positive sign for Amazon's performance.

2. I don't have any other tweets provided beyond this one, so I can only analyze this single tweet.

Now, assessing sentiment: The first tweet mentions URL consolidation and looks good over 406, which suggests that there's improvement or positive news about Amazon's site. That would likely translate to a positive outlook for the stock price because improved performance often leads to better investor sentiment.

Since there are no other factors mentioned here, I can't have conflicting information from other tweets. So this tweet is all about the positive aspects of Amazon's current situation, which should positively impact their stock price.

Putting it all together, the analysis points towards a positive outcome for Amazon, so the overall sentiment is Positive."
2014-01-12,Negative,"Okay, I'm looking at these tweets trying to figure out how they might affect the stock price of IBM and Amazon. Let me start by breaking down each tweet step by step.

First tweet: ""stop worrying about ibm's revenues $ ibm $ amzn URL"". Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. It mentions revenues but doesn't specify if it's positive or negative. The mention of ""url"" could mean either an email or a URL to something else. I don't know much about the context here, so I'll have to keep this as neutral for now.

Second tweet: ""I just saw that ibm is going to make big changes in their product portfolio. What do you think? $ibm stock"". This one clearly mentions positive changes in their product development. It sounds like IBM is excited about future innovations. That's a strong indicator of positive sentiment.

Third tweet: ""Amazon is the best company in the world. $amazon url"". Again, it doesn't specify what the author is thinking but the phrase seems to express admiration for Amazon as if they're considering major changes or updates. This could be very positive.

Fourth tweet: ""I don't think i'm gonna miss out on any ibm stock $ibm url"". Here, the user is expressing concern about missing out on IBM stock. It sounds like they're worried about not getting their investment back. That's a clear negative sentiment showing doubt about the stock price.

Now, I need to combine these factors. There are two positive tweets (second and third) and two negative tweets (first and fourth). Positive tweets indicate good news for investors, while negatives suggest concerns.

But wait, each tweet is just one point in time. It's a bit tricky because they're separated by spaces and sentences might mix information. The first tweet could be implying something about revenues but not clarifying the impact on stock price yet. The second tweet clearly points towards positive developments. However, some tweets like the fourth are more direct about concerns.

Since there are both positive and negative indicators, it's hard to weigh them equally. IBM has strong moves in their product portfolio (second and third), which could mean good earnings or future successes. But Amazon's emphasis might indicate potential growth, though I'm not sure if that's related to IBM stock directly. The user's worry about missing out on IBM stock is a big concern.

I think the overall sentiment isn't overwhelmingly positive because while there are some positive signs, the concerns about IBM stock are significant enough to outweigh them. It's possible the impact might be mixed, but leaning more towards negative due to the direct worry expressed."
2014-01-13,Neutral,"Okay, so I have to figure out how the given tweets affect Amazon's stock price impact on their future stock. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER amazon's workforce has tripled in 3 years , growing faster than other tech giants . URL $ amzn URL"". That looks like Amazon (AMZN) is mentioned as the target stock with the URL being $amZN.

Next, for each relevant tweet, I need to separate them into positive and negative factors. But looking at the tweets provided, none of them mention anything about AMZN's performance. All of them talk about hiring processes or sales. So there are no explicit positive or negative factors related to Amazon's stock here.

Then, I have to assess the sentiment of each tweet. Since all the relevant tweets are discussing internal processes and possibly Amazon's sales against competitors, they might be indicating a favorable environment but not necessarily a strong performance in terms of revenue or earnings. They could suggest that Amazon is strong internally and has good strategies, which sometimes can lead to positive signals.

But wait, some tweets mention their workforce having tripled in 3 years. That could imply faster growth in operations, which might positively influence the stock price. However, the other negative factors like ""a look inside amazon's rigorous hiring process"" might indicate concerns about leadership or management quality. It's a mix of positive and negative signals.

I don't see any direct mention of earnings reports or actual financial data for Amazon. So without concrete information on sales, profits, or revenue, it's hard to assess the sentiment in that area.

Since there are no explicit mentions of AMZN's performance factors, I have to rely on what these tweets suggest about internal conditions and environment. The fact that their workforce is growing faster might indicate strong organizational capabilities, which can be a positive sign for investors who look at company culture.

However, the mention of hiring processes being rigorous could raise concerns if there are issues with leadership or management. But without specific data points, it's speculative. It's possible that these tweets are more about the company as a business and its operations rather than financial performance.

In conclusion, while some tweets suggest positive aspects like strong workforce growth and internal processes, others imply potential areas for concern. Without clear evidence of revenue growth or earnings reports, I can't make an exact assessment, but since there's optimism in the workforce aspect, it leans towards a positive sentiment."
2014-01-14,Neutral,"Okay, I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by analyzing each tweet individually.

The first tweet mentions ""people quoting $ AMZN's P/E ratio are on fumes,"" which sounds positive because it's talking about a company's financial health and encouraging investors to buy more. That gives me a positive outlook.

The second tweet is about Fibonacci technical levels for the stock prices of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google. Technical analysis can indicate trends or potential moves in stock prices, but without specific data, I'm not sure if it affects sentiment directly. It might show support, so maybe positive.

The third tweet talks about a user's ""sell Netflix"" on Twitter, referring to AT&T for short. Selling another stock is usually seen as negative because it reduces investor confidence. However, sometimes people sell stocks they didn't own, but this doesn't necessarily mean overall negative sentiment unless there are other factors like support from positive tweets.

Considering all three tweets, the first and second might suggest a bit of support or trend towards Amazon's future performance. The third is more speculative and could be a mix of expectation and lack of clarity on how it affects the stock price."
2014-01-15,Neutral,"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to analyze the given tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price as either Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking through the tweets:

1. ""looking for $ amzn to get into that 400 to 406 channel today"" – The target is AMZN.
2. ""$ goog ~ 2x $ amzn ~ 4x $ appl ~ 2x $ msft ~ 1x $ ebay ~ 2x URL"" – Target stock symbols are GOOG, AMZN, APPL, MSFT, and YB.
3. ""rt AT_USER dbw 14 AT_USER refers to $ amzn stock as "" a cult "" - - "" and a cult i think you should join "" in investment terms."""" – The target here is also AMZN.
4. ""rt AT_USER google outspends top 5 rivals combined - $ aapl , $ fb , $ msft , $ yhoo , $ amzn - in deals push, with nest just the latest. URL"" – Target is again AMZN.

So, all tweets are focused on AMZN and some other related companies.

Next, I need to analyze each tweet for positive or negative factors. 

Looking at tweet 1: It mentions a 400-406 channel, which could relate to AMZN's growth potential. The idea is to get into a specific channel, so it might be seen as a strategic move by a competitor.

Tweet 2 lists valuations for AMZN against GOOG, APPL, MSFT, YB. It says AMZN is 4x and others are 2x or less. This suggests high valuation but could mean either good or bad news depending on the context.

Tweet 3 talks about AMZN being referred to as a cult. The tweet mentions that AMZN should be ""a cult"" and encourages joining an investment club. This might imply support from investors who think AMZN is unethical, which could influence investor sentiment negatively.

Tweet 4 discusses Google's growth by spilling deals with competitors. If Google is investing heavily in other companies to boost its own stock, it could indicate positive news for Amazon's future because it suggests a competitive advantage or expansion strategy.

Now, combining these factors:

- Tweet 1: Strategic entry could be a selling point but might not necessarily be negative.
- Tweets 2 and 4 are about valuations and market expansion, which can affect investor sentiment. High valuation (4x) for AMZN could indicate concern, while the other companies being less expensive suggest a mix of cautious and cautious outlook.
- Tweet 3 is more about sentiment than specific information.

Overall, Twitter's tweets are discussing different aspects but don't provide enough concrete data to form a strong conclusion. However, if all tweets collectively seem to support AMZN by highlighting its growth potential or strategic moves, it might lean towards Positive. But there's no clear dominant opinion that would make the overall sentiment positive or negative."
2014-01-16,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and decide their impact on Amazon's stock price. So, first, I need to understand what each tweet is saying.

Starting with the first tweet: ""AT_USER facebook makes amazon look cheap URL $ amzn $ fb"". Hmm, I'm not entirely sure what AT_USER stands for here. Maybe it's a typo or part of the query. It seems like Facebook is being mentioned as something to make Amazon look cheap, but I don't know if that means they're lowering the price or just making it seem less expensive. Not sure about this one yet.

The second tweet is ""rt AT_USER a vote to unionize AT_USER warehouse workers in the us failed last night . our poll says its a wake-up call for $ amzn http …"". This looks like someone is talking about unionizing warehouse workers, which could potentially increase labor costs. If Amazon has high wages or payrolls, it might affect their bottom line. I'm not sure if this positive or negative impact is clear yet.

The third tweet: ""$ bby goes from $ 13 bln company to $ 9b co as reality hits : margin compression / price war is here to stay amid secular shift ( online ) $ amzn"". This seems like Amazon's stock value has decreased, and they're saying things about margins compressing or price wars continuing. That sounds pretty negative because if Amazon is facing these issues, it could hurt their earnings and overall stock performance.

The fourth tweet: ""$ amzn bango selects interxion to support the global expansion of its mobile ... URL"". This one mentions a product launch by Interactions aimed at supporting Amazon's global expansion in mobile space. It doesn't specify if this is positive or negative, but I think it might boost their international efforts, which could be good for future sales and revenue.

Now, looking at each tweet's factors:

1. The first tweet has Facebook making Amazon look cheap. Maybe it's a play on words or not related to stock price.
2. A vote to unionize warehouse workers is about labor costs, which can influence the company's pricing strategy. Could be positive if they pass.
3. Amazon dropping in stock and talking about margins and price wars are clear negative signals.
4. Interactions' product launch for global expansion could be a positive sign as it might attract more customers.

So combining all these factors: The first tweet is unclear, the second has some potential but not sure, the third clearly indicates negative news with margin compression, and the fourth shows growth in international expansion.

Overall, I think Amazon's stock is going to be affected by both positive and negative signals. While their international expansion could improve, the price war and margins might drag them down. It seems like there's a mix of positives and negatives here."

2014-01-18,Missing,File not found
2014-01-19,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for a given company. The user provided two tweets and asked to decide if each is positive, neutral, or negative in terms of their impact.

First, I'll start by identifying the target stock from the tweets. Both tweets mention ""bby"" and ""amazon."" Since bby might be an unrelated entity, maybe it's not a company we're focusing on. However, Amazon is a well-known company with significant market impact. So, I think the relevant tweet here is the second one: ""$ amzn key.""

Next, I need to break down each tweet into positive and negative factors.

Looking at the first tweet: ""$ bby did not crater the markets friday due to brick and mortar status , but we are just getting started with earnings . $ amzn key ."" This seems like a statement that could be confusing or irrelevant because it's mixing up bby and amzn, both of which might be different companies. The mention of ""brick and mortar"" is probably a typo or irrelevant context. It doesn't seem to provide any useful information about Amazon or its performance.

Moving on to the second tweet: ""$ amzn key."" This is more straightforward. It's simply acknowledging that Amazon has a ""key"" something, which is likely an abbreviation for a specific product or service. Since it's just a casual statement without providing any new information, it doesn't influence investor sentiment positively or negatively.

So, both tweets seem to be either confusing or irrelevant regarding the stock price of Amazon. The first tweet might be seen as a distraction because of the mixed-up words and possibly unrelated context. The second tweet is just a simple acknowledgment, which likely has no impact on the market.

Putting it all together, neither tweet provides any meaningful information about Amazon's performance. Therefore, the overall sentiment should be neutral."
2014-01-20,Missing,File not found
2014-01-21,Negative,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price and determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative.

First, looking at each tweet:

1. The first one mentions that Amazon is considering a new online pay TV service called ""dj,"" which probably means dj. But this seems like just an update, not directly related to the company itself. It doesn't provide any specific information about Amazon's financial performance.

2. The second tweet talks about $ amzn and mentions ""stocks stocks stockaction."" This is more about investing terminology and not relevant to the stock's performance.

3. The third tweet has a mix of symbols like $ bbry $ dyn $ eght $ glng $ goro $ lscc $ scco $ wtr URL. These are all market caps, so they don't mention anything about Amazon or its stock price. They're probably irrelevant to the analysis.

4. The fourth tweet says that longing after $ srpt 28.50 and stopping a position at $ amzn 405c, which stopped outperforming $ bbry 9.80. This is talking about trading strategies, specifically stop orders, but again, this isn't directly related to Amazon's stock performance.

5. The fifth tweet suggests that $ amzn probably came to the conclusion that it only makes money on a 3p rate, despite its large infrastructure of 1p. The word ""only"" here might imply they think their current approach is too simplistic or insufficient, which could affect investor sentiment if the company's strategy leads them to doubt profitability.

6. The sixth tweet discusses avoiding unions and Walmart-style bad press via $ amzn $ wmt. Again, this seems like irrelevant investment advice with no direct relation to Amazon.

Putting it all together, the relevant point from tweet 5 is about their approach and possibly their evaluation of their current strategy's effectiveness. If they think their method only makes money on a low-performing platform (3p rate instead of a better one), that might lead investors to doubt the stock performance, which could be seen as negative sentiment.

So overall, the negative impact based on tweet 5 seems most relevant."
2014-01-22,Positive,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. I need to analyze each tweet and see if they indicate a positive, neutral, or negative trend.

Starting with the first tweet, it mentions all-time highs for several stocks including AMZN. This is clearly a positive signal because more people are talking about all-time peaks, which could boost investor confidence.

The second tweet says Amazon is expanding online video efforts by licensing TV channels. This sounds like a good strategy to attract more customers and increase sales, so that's another positive point.

Looking at the third tweet, it mentions ""2 URL"" followed by two words after a slash. I think this might be a typo or maybe just part of the URL structure. If it says 2 URLs, it could mean multiple services or something related to AMZN. It seems like additional information isn't changing the overall sentiment much.

The fourth tweet talks about automating hybrid cloud work. This is a strategic move that can improve efficiency and lower costs for companies. It's definitely a positive sign for Amazon, so that adds to the positive analysis.

The fifth tweet mentions automation in cloud settings. Similar to the fourth one, this suggests ongoing improvements and better services, which should positively affect stock performance.

Finally, the sixth tweet asks if a hedge fund can save Radioshack. This seems like speculative advice. Hedge funds usually involve some level of risk, but even so, the suggestion might not necessarily be seen as negative by many investors, just something that could be risky.

The seventh tweet discusses setup and watching lists for Wednesday's AMZN launch. It's about upcoming events related to Amazon. While it's important to keep up with their announcements, it doesn't directly impact current sentiment strongly compared to the other tweets.

Putting it all together, each tweet is either providing information that supports growth (all-time highs, expansion efforts, automation) or suggesting something that could be risky but not in outright negative terms. So overall, these tweets seem to collectively indicate a positive outlook for Amazon."
2014-01-23,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about the stock price of Amazon. The user provided eight tweets and wants me to determine if each is positive, neutral, or negative towards Amazon. Then, I need to summarize them all into a single line.

First, I'll look at each tweet one by one.

1. ""thinking of investing in $ oxy $ amzn $ icpt check out URL"" – Hmm, this seems like a stock pick but it's not clear if the user is predicting positive or negative things about Amazon. It doesn't specify any positive indicators yet.

2. ""rt AT_USER real estate's least sexy sector is red hot : URL ( via AT_USER $ amzn"" – This tweet mentions real estate and how one of its sectors is very popular. Real estate can be a broad field, but if the user thinks it's in a 'least sexy' category, that might indicate uncertainty or mixed feelings about market trends.

3. ""$ amzn - [ video ] amazon exploring online pay-tv service , and more -> URL stock stocks stockaction"" – This tweet is about Amazon releasing something related to their services. They're promoting the company by showing interest in their products. That could be seen as positive because it's a way to attract investors.

4. ""AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER yes . $ amzn thought big and backers bet big . $ btc ventures are small , cautious bets . who's betting against visa ?"" – This tweet is quite long with several keywords: $ amzn thinking big, backers betting big, Bitcoin ventures small, cautious bets, and people betting against visa. It seems like the user is expressing uncertainty and possibly a mix of positive and negative sentiment about Amazon.

5. ""$ revo it ran 1,100 % for our subscribers , in 5 weeks . is it ready once again ? URL $ amzn $ mcox $ goog"" – This tweet talks about Revo's revenue growth and the potential to launch their services (AmZN and MCox) within five weeks. Positive language like ""ran"" and ""ready once again"" suggests optimism that the stock might improve.

6. ""$ amzn - [ video ] buy retailers with strong e-commerce : trader -> URL stock stocks stockaction"" – Similar to tweet 3, this is promoting Amazon by showing interest in their products, which can be seen as a positive signal for investors.

7. ""$ amzn - [ video ] buy retailers with strong e-commerce : trader -> URL stock stocks stockaction"" – Same as the previous one; again, emphasizing Amazon's products and potential growth through e-commerce.

8. ""URL inc stock update for january 23 , 2014 $ amzn URL"" – This tweet is a simple stock price announcement for Amazon on January 23rd, 2014. It's likely referring to an official or significant event related to the stock price.

Now, summarizing each:

1. Stock pick but unclear sentiment.
2. Unclear about real estate sector but mentions it's hot.
3. Promoting Amazon services to attract investors – positive.
4. Uncertainty and a mix of positive bets and cautious bets – mixed.
5. Positive outlook on revenue growth – optimistic.
6. Promoting Amazon by talking about retailers and e-commerce – positive.
7. Same as 6; again, promoting Amazon through e-commerce – positive.
8. Simple stock update – neutral.

Overall sentiment: The tweets show a mix of positive outlooks (promoting services, revenue growth) but also some uncertainty or mixed reactions from different angles like real estate sectors and investor sentiment.

I think the overall sentiment is mixed because while there are positive elements like promoting Amazon and growth potential, the user's mentions about real estate, cautious betting, and visa uncertainty suggest uncertainty. However, the emphasis on services and revenue growth makes it seem hopeful."
2014-01-24,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and figure out how they'll impact the stock price of the company. Let me start by going through each tweet one by one.

The first tweet says, ""$ amzn - is URL inc . girding for war over net neutrality changes ? -> URL stock stocks stockaction."" Hmm, this seems a bit off-topic. It mentions something about URLs and net neutrality, which isn't directly related to the company I'm looking at. Maybe it's unrelated.

The second tweet is ""ebay reliance on PayPal for growth lowers chances of spinoff URL $ amzn $ ebay $ ma $ v $ aapl $ 4331."" This looks like an email from eBay about their revenue growth and the potential spin-off of a joint venture. It seems positive because it's talking about growth, so that might indicate a good outlook for the stock.

Third tweet: ""$ amzn - 3 reasons why bed bath & beyond is leading the way in home goods retail ... -> URL stock stocks stockaction."" Again, this is discussing the company's product line and revenue trends. It seems positive because it's highlighting their growth areas.

Fourth tweet says, "" civilian drones to swarm u . s . skies , but not just yet URL ibdnews vía AT_USER $ amzn $ bhp $ rio $ avav $ ba $ lmt."" This is talking about something else, maybe personal stuff with drones. It doesn't seem directly related to the company.

Fifth tweet: ""if this market selloff continues for another 5-10 % , there will be some great investing opportunities : $ aapl $ amzn $ goog $ tsla $ twtr $ yhoo."" This is talking about a potential decline in the market leading to investing, which could mean positive news. It suggests that there are chances of better stock prices if the market improves.

Sixth tweet: ""rt AT_USER more signs of shift from bricks to clicks in earnings call , with huge implications for $ goog $ amzn $ ebay $ aapl $ eat $ cmg $ dri $ …"" This is talking about changes in earnings calls, especially from bricks to clicks. It might indicate some positive developments or signaling something better ahead.

Seventh tweet: ""rt AT_USER looks like AT_USER web services took down one of the biggest names in servers . URL $ amzn."" While this is a bit off-topic again, it mentions something significant about a company, which could be seen as positive. But since the main focus seems to be on other aspects, I'm not sure if it's directly related.

Now, combining these thoughts: The tweets are mostly talking about growth (like eBay, bed bath & beyond, googling) and some mention earnings calls but more about possible shifts in a different area. There are no negative mentions about the company itself. 

So overall, all the tweets seem to be positive or somewhat neutral because they don't directly indicate any bad news. They're all about potential growth and positive developments that could impact the stock price positively."
2014-01-25,Neutral,"Okay, let's try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, I have these tweets about Amazon and some factors influencing investor sentiment towards their stock price. The goal is to determine if the overall impact is positive, neutral, or negative on Amazon's future stock price.

First, looking at the target stock symbol from the first tweet: $amzn. That must be Amazon.com, right? So I'm focusing on whether this company will experience growth and profitability, especially since they're talking about ""high growth"" and expecting no profits to repeat.

Now, let me break down each tweet one by one. The second tweet says, ""$ amzn will the q on q story of high growth & no profits repeat ? we find the current valuation very risky to enter URL."" Hmm, it's a bit jumbled with some abbreviations like ""q"" which might stand for something. Maybe it refers to quarter earnings or something else related to Amazon's performance.

The third tweet is: ""$ amzn will the q on q story of high growth & no profits repeat ? we find the current valuation very risky to enter URL."" Wait, that seems identical to the second one? Or maybe there was a mistake in formatting. I'll check again. It's the same text as the second tweet but with a typo.

Assuming it's the same content, both tweets are discussing Amazon's potential for high growth and low profits, implying that they might not be investing much. The mention of ""valuation very risky"" suggests uncertainty about Amazon's value relative to its peers or competitors.

Since both tweets talk about potential risks related to high growth but no profit repetition, it indicates that the market is cautious. Investors are concerned because if Amazon doesn't generate profits as expected, their stock might be seen as undervalued. Therefore, this could lead some investors to doubt the stock price movement.

I should also consider other factors like current financial health, product performance, and company strategy. But based on the tweets, there's no clear positive or negative message. The tweets are quite cautious about Amazon's potential growth and profitability issues, which might reduce investor confidence.

Putting it all together, the sentiment seems neutral because while there's some risk involved due to low profits repetition, it's not strongly positive or negative enough to tip either direction. Investors might be divided, but on average, I'd say the stock is viewed as less favorable."
2014-01-26,Positive,"Okay, so I have to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company and then conclude whether it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me start by breaking down each tweet one by one.

First, I need to figure out which stock symbol is being referred to in these tweets. The first tweet mentions ""rt AT_USER"" with various company names: $ aa $ aapl $ amzn $ bx $ cmg $ fb $ lulu $ lvs $ ma $ psx $ stx $ vmw $ yhoo. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe it's the stock ticker symbols. I know some of these might be known companies or something related to Apple Inc., given the other tweets also mention AMZN and YHOO.

Looking at tweet 1: ""rt AT_USER earnings finally matter URL $ aa $ aapl $ amzn $ bx $ cmg $ fb $ lulu $ lvs $ ma $ psx $ stx $ vmw $ yhoo"". The first word is RT, which usually stands for ""Retweet"" on Twitter. So the company being referred to might be AT_USER, but I'm not sure what that company is known as. Maybe it's a smaller tech company or perhaps an unrelated one.

The second tweet: ""rt AT_USER amazon's jeff bezos announced as the no . 1 ceo in the world in a new ranking of the top 100 URL $ amzn …"". This seems more concrete. It mentions AMZN, which I know is Amazon Inc., and Jeff Bezos, the former CEO. So this tweet is about Amazon's CEO making it to the top 100 list.

The third tweet: ""24 of the world's biggest companies report earnings next week . including $ amzn , $ goog , $ fb , and $ aapl : URL"". This seems related again to AMZN, possibly another company like Google or Facebook. It lists several big tech companies expected to earn this week.

Now, summarizing what each tweet says: The first tweet is about AT_USER earnings mattering, but I'm not sure who that company is. The second and third tweets are discussing Amazon's CEO reaching the top of a ranking list for 100 companies and expecting multiple big tech companies to report earnings.

So, considering these points, if someone mentions that AMZN (Amazon) is making it onto the top 100 company rankings, and others expect bigger companies like Apple or Google to earn this week, this could indicate positive news. Investors might see an expectation of growth, which can be a sign that the stock price will go up.

But I also need to consider if AT_USER's earnings mattering is relevant. If AT_USER isn't a known company in the tech sector or perhaps it's a smaller entity unrelated to tech, this could have a neutral or negative impact depending on their specific sector. However, since other tweets are about AMZN's CEO reaching the top and earnings reports, the positive aspect might still be more prominent.

Putting it all together: The main focus seems to be on Amazon's performance as well as the expectation of growth from other tech companies. This could lead to a positive sentiment because high expectations can drive stock prices up."
2014-01-27,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to determine whether each tweet is likely going to have a positive, neutral, or negative impact on the stock price of a given company. The target stock symbol isn't specified here, but based on the tweets, it's probably related to tech companies since they're talking about earnings and stock quotes.

Let me look at the first few tweets:

1. ""rt AT_USER rt AT_USER 24 of world's biggest companies report earnings next week . including $ amzn , $ goog , $ fb , and $ amzn : URL""

Hmm, this tweet is just informing the user that many top companies are expected to report earnings soon. The tone here seems positive because it's acknowledging some good news for several big names. So I'm thinking this might have a positive impact.

2. ""oh yeah - $ aapl $ fb $ amzn earnings this week !""

This one is more specific. It mentions that all three of these companies will report their earnings this week. The use of ""yes"" and the fact that it's explicitly stating the names could lead to optimism among investors. So again, probably positive.

3. ""$ amzn stock quote , 3:16 pm : 389.31 +1.71 ( +0.44 % ) .""

This tweet is about the closing price of Apple. It's providing information on a technical analysis chart. Positive numbers indicate higher stock prices, which might make people think the stock is undervalued or overbought. However, without knowing past trends or current market conditions, it's hard to tell if this should be positive or not. But since they're just reporting the price movement, it seems neutral because it doesn't explicitly state anything about earnings or future performance.

4. ""rt AT_USER big earnings next week - open interest and implied volatility for $ aapl $ fb $ amzn $ cmg $ goog $ ma URL""

This tweet is telling the user that there are going to be a lot of earnings reports from several companies, including Apple, Google, Amazon, and maybe some others. The mention of open interest and implied volatility suggests they're interested in the financials because high implied volatility might indicate concerns about their valuation. This could create pressure on the stock prices if investors expect higher valuations due to increased volatility. So this seems like a negative factor because it's making the company more expensive for investors.

5. ""AT_USER man , throw in earnings from 4 major companies and we've really got a party . $ aapl $ goog $ amzn $ fb""

This tweet is encouraging people to join in on the earnings news from four big tech companies. It seems friendly and supportive, which would likely be positive for the stock price because investors are feeling optimistic about upcoming earnings.

Now, putting it all together. Tweets 1 and 2 mention that several top companies will report earnings this week. Positive signals could boost investor confidence, so these are probably positive tweets. Tweet 3 only mentions the current stock price but doesn't give any direct information about future performance or impact on the stock. It might be neutral because it's just providing data without context.

Tweets 4 and 5 talk about upcoming earnings and financial metrics that could affect stock prices. The expectation of more earnings might push the stock up, so these are also positive. Tweet 3 is a bit uncertain as it doesn't mention anything about future performance but just market sentiment. So overall, tweets 1, 2, 4, and 5 all seem to have mixed signals, but mostly leaning towards positive. Tweet 3 is ambiguous.

However, considering that tweet 3 provides market data without any narrative or direct impact on the stock price, it might not be a strong indicator of sentiment. The other tweets are more about confirming earnings reports which can have a significant positive effect on the stock price because they show confidence in future performance."
2014-01-28,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. So, I need to analyze these tweets about two companies—Amzn and Aapl—and determine their impact on their stock prices. The user has given me four tweets, each with a different focus.

First, I'll start by extracting the target stocks from each tweet. Looking at them, both are mentioned: $ amzn for Amzn and $ aapl for Aapl. So that's straightforward—each is separate. 

Next, I need to analyze each tweet one by one. Let me take them in order.

Starting with the first tweet: ""Amzn 380 huge and great place to define risk . any reaction off of 390 and this can drop to 360."" Hmm, so it's talking about Amzn, probably a typo or maybe miswritten, but I think it's referring to Amazon. It mentions that they're ""huge"" and ""great,"" which gives them a positive vibe. The user is worried if the stock will drop from $390 to $360—so that's a price decline. But it's not just any reaction; the tweet seems serious, giving Amazon a more positive outlook.

The second tweet: ""Call me 'cre-cre' but i'd rather own flat aapl continually posting $13b profit than 25% growth amzn with rev’s $17b , $500m loss , & 1415pe."" Okay, this one is comparing Aapl and Amzn. The user says ""call me 'cre-cre'"" but sounds frustrated with Amazon? Wait, that seems like a typo or maybe an initial reaction. They mention Aapl continually posting $13b profit—so positive for Aapl. But then compare it to Amzn's 25% growth and rev’s $17b revenue. Also, mentions a $500m loss and P/E ratio of 1415. So, Aapl is doing better financially but maybe less profitable? The user is comparing the two companies based on some metrics—profit vs. revenue and price per share. They seem more concerned about Amzn's growth compared to their profits.

Third tweet: ""$ amzn netflix gears up to expand in europe URL."" This one is a bit confusing, but it seems like Aapl is talking about Netflix expanding into Europe with a link or URL. So that's definitely related to Netflix and the company. It mentions that netflix is ""gearing up"" which could imply they might increase their market share or revenue as Netflix expands. That sounds positive for Netflix-related companies, which would be good news for Aapl if it's connected.

Fourth tweet: ""AT_USER inc. ( $ amzn ) rising quickly ! currently priced at 392.41 . URL."" This is about AT_USER, which I think refers to Apple Inc. The user is stating that the company is ""inc. (Amzn)"" and their stock price is up. So, this indicates a positive reaction for Apple.

Now, putting it all together. Let me list each tweet's sentiment:

1. Amzn: Positive because they're worried about a price drop from 390 to 360, giving them a positive outlook.
2. Aapl: The user is more concerned with comparing their profits versus other metrics. They prefer owning flat performance but compare it to higher growth companies. There's some frustration here, especially the mention of loss and P/E ratio—maybe indicating that the user is cautious about Amzn? Or perhaps they're trying to suggest that Amzn might not be as good as Aapl?
3. Netflix: Positive because netflix is expanding in Europe, which could boost their performance.
4. Apple: Positive because AT_USER is rising quickly, indicating better news for them.

So, overall sentiment-wise, the user seems positive about both companies. They're focused on comparing different aspects of Amzn's performance and have some initial frustration but ultimately see a positive outlook for both. The other tweet about Netflix seems like it could be positive too. 

But wait, in the fourth tweet, it just mentions AT_USER rising quickly. I don't know if that's a significant factor or more than a minor one. But the user seems to have a mixed reaction—furious at Amazon but positive for Apple.

So, considering all four tweets: Amzn is worried about a price decline, Aapl is comparing performance metrics, Netflix expands in Europe, and Apple rises. All of these are positive signs overall. Even though there's some frustration with Amzn, the other three are more positive than negative or neutral."
2014-01-29,Positive,"Alright, let me tackle this query step by step. The user has given me three tweets related to Amazon's stock and is asking for my analysis on their impact on future stock price. I need to determine if each tweet is positive, neutral, or negative in terms of its likely effect.

First, I'll start by identifying the target stock from the tweets. It seems all three tweets are about Amazon (AMZN), so that's straightforward. The key here is to assess how these tweets affect AMZN's performance based on sentiment and content.

Looking at the first tweet: ""$ amzn [ video ] google and amazon earnings need to convince fundamental investors URL."" This looks like a promotional offer or update related to AMZN's earnings. Since it mentions financials and aiming to convince funders, this seems positive because investors might be encouraged to buy more.

The second tweet is ""$ amazon to offer brick-and-mortar stores a kindle tablet checkout system $ amzn URL."" Here, the mention of physical locations using tech products like kindle tablets is a common marketing strategy. Physical stores are appealing to many consumers and can boost sales. This positive aspect suggests that Amazon's product offerings might increase revenue, which is generally positive for stock price.

The third tweet: ""$ amzn earnings preview : amazon expected to beat q4 estimates by ' significant amount ' URL."" This tweet suggests that the company is forecasting strong earnings, specifically beating Q4 estimates. Strong positive financial expectations can lead investors to buy more shares because they're looking for growth potential, which directly impacts AMZN's stock price positively.

Putting it all together, each tweet seems to highlight benefits or forecasts related to Amazon's earnings and future performance. They either offer opportunities in product development or positive financial outlooks. These are all signals that could lead to a rise in the stock price.

However, I should double-check if any of these tweets might be negative. The first one mentions ""convincing fundamental investors,"" which is a common positive marketing tactic. The second tweet about physical stores is more about convenience but still beneficial for consumers. The third tweet's bold statement about beating estimates adds confidence to the stock.

I'm pretty confident that all three tweets are indicating positive sentiment regarding Amazon. They're either offering exciting opportunities or reinforcing confidence in future performance. So, I'll conclude with a positive overall sentiment."
2014-01-30,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine their likely impact on Amazon's stock price and then decide whether it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions that the millionaires and uranium-Pinto-Banana products are about Amazon earnings tomorrow. That sounds like a positive sign because it gives investors something to expect.

2. The second tweet talks about the Nasdaq rally with Dow triple-digit gains, but they're not enough for an overnight move. This could be a micro-term or short-term effect, which might keep stock prices from going up much.

3. The third tweet suggests Amazon is planning a checkout system using Kindle tablets. If that's true, it could boost their revenue and market share, contributing to positive sentiment.

4. The fourth tweet lists various companies with Amazon: AMZN, AMC, CMG, CRCM, WYMN. This seems like a complete list of earnings reports, which is usually good news as investors are often eager to see these results.

5. The fifth tweet is about whether the earnings will miss the forecast or be taken up by sellers. If they're missing the forecast, that's a red flag because it can hurt Amazon's stock.

6. This tweet seems unrelated, mentioning something about playing for a meal but not giving a direct reason. It might lead to speculation rather than an actual news event affecting the stock price.

7. The seventh tweet talks about Amazon offering brick-and-mortar stores with a kindle tablet checkout system. This is a concrete positive sign, so that should boost the stock.

8. The eighth tweet mentions $AMZN's earning as part of conscious capitalism but I don't have enough context to evaluate if this changes investor sentiment.

9. The ninth tweet suggests buying 40 shares at $368 each. If it's not a valid trade, like just waiting before selling, that could cause flash points and maybe some volatility, which might be negative.

10. The tenth tweet discusses P/E ratio, suggesting that if the company doesn't meet it, their stock price will drop. This is a direct indicator of investor concern, so negative sentiment likely.

11. The eleventh tweet talks about Amazon's morale based on a URL mentioning ""male che c'è $AMZN che mi tira su il morale &."" I'm not sure what that's saying, but it might be pointing towards negative news regarding their employees or management.

12. The twelfth tweet is about Amazon announcing quarterly results. A positive announcement can boost the stock price.

13. The thirteenth tweet mentions a quarter result announcement. If this leads to a significant increase in stock prices, that's positive.

14. The fourteenth tweet suggests that while Amazon doesn't miss revenue, their sales are high. This could be a micro-term effect or ongoing performance.

15. The fifteenth tweet confirms that Amazon is expanding support services for physical retailers using kindle tablets. More tangible news about the company can drive stock price increases.

16. The sixteenth tweet says $AMZN was busy breaking their earnings but couldn't beat estimates. This could lead to negative sentiment as investors might see a lack of solid fundamentals.

17. The seventeenth tweet mentions that Amazon missed revenue estimates in 8 out of the last 10 quarters, which is bad news because it's an internal concern that could erode investor confidence and stock price.

18. This tweet lists several companies with Amazon, which seems like a complete list to attract investors. It's likely to boost stock prices as a sign of growth potential.

19. The eighteenth tweet suggests that $AMZN is missing earnings but is still in the business. The fact that they're not missing it can be positive because it shows they are strong.

20. The nineteenth tweet refers to Google and Amazon moving late on earnings, which could cause flash points or market speculation if expected.

21. The twentieth tweet mentions multiple companies with $AMZN as part of their earnings reports. This is a common sign that could lead to higher stock prices because it attracts attention.

22. The twenty-first tweet lists other S&P 500 stocks performing, which might give some indication but isn't a direct impact on Amazon's price.

23. This tweet is just in the middle of a discussion about $AMZN bonds yielding gains after the 5-year debt auction. This could indicate investor sentiment about the company's financial health and growth prospects.

24. The twenty-fourth tweet lists several S&P stocks including AMZN, which is typical for investors to follow earnings reports, indicating positive news.

25. The twentieth tweet mentions that $AMZN is on a wild action here as well. This could be a micro-term or flash point event where the stock may experience small price changes without much impact.

26. The last tweet uses an emoji and claims ""wow!"" to call out a trading tip. While it's a positive reaction, I don't have enough information about how that affects the stock price.

Now, putting all these together: There are several tweets with good news (renewed earnings, brick-and-mortar stores, comprehensive earnings reports) which should increase sentiment positively. However, there are mentions of missed earnings or negative trends like missing revenue estimates in quarters and potential flash points. I'm leaning towards a mostly positive but with some minor negative factors."
2014-01-31,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how these tweets affect Amazon's stock price from positive, negative, or neutral. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock, which is ""AMZ."" Then, for each tweet, I have to separate the factors into positive and negative. From the list, some tweets are mentions of AMZN on Twitter, others discuss earnings or market trends.

Looking at each tweet:

1. It talks about AMZN raising their annual fee by up to $40, which seems like a positive financial decision. This could reduce costs and might be good for investors. So this is a positive factor.

2. Some analysts are still recommending AMZN but there's no downgrade. The user is saying they ""still recommends BTD,"" but I'm not sure about BTD. Maybe it's another stock? Regardless, the main point is that there's mixed sentiment on AMZN. So both factors aren't clear yet.

3. The tweet mentions subscribers could lose, and prices might still be higher than cheapest. This sounds like a negative factor because losing subscribers would eat into revenue. Positive: 10 / mo seems neutral; not sure about the subscriber part.

4. It mentions several companies including AMZN. I don't have info on each, but perhaps it's positive as it's general. So both factors here are unknown or mixed.

5. The tweet talks about analyzing costs and stock performance in a recap. This could be positive if it leads to better understanding of the company. But since it's not specific to AMZN, I'm unsure.

6. Another recommendation to AMZN but similar mix as tweet 2.

7. It asks whether AMZN lovers will stick with price hikes. If positive, that would support AMZN's stock. If negative, maybe the opposite? Not sure yet.

8. The user is warning AMZN not to panic and suggesting buyers come back after the market recap. This sounds positive as it gives a clear outlook on future earnings, which can boost shares.

9. A comment about a 9% increase in price from Wall Street resistence. If price increases despite resistance, that's positive for AMZN stock.

10. The tweet says AMZN misses/lowers the stock and it rises sharply. Maybe this is negative because missing earnings could hurt.

11. The user buysgoog and went long amzn. This suggests a speculative move; not sure about the sentiment yet.

12. The price of amzn goes up, but I don't have more info on why or how.

13. They restate their positive rating for AMZN, which is good but if ratings can change based on new info later.

14. A tweet from another user offering transparency and free trials as risk mitigation. This could be positive because providing better information might attract investors.

15. Pre-opening stock movers comparing znxr vs goog. Not directly related to amzn, so maybe not relevant.

16. Market wrap with various stocks. Not specific to AMZN, but the mention of AMZN is part of it. So a bit mixed info.

17. A general statement about Amazon's issues, which could be positive or negative depending on context.

18. The overall market summary lists several stock prices, including AMZN. I don't have enough information to assess this as it's too broad.

19. It suggests that AMZN might end the free ride if prices are higher. This could be a negative factor because missing subscribers can affect revenue.

20. AMZN closing near $385, which is optimal for earnings. If the price aligns with the right expectations, this could be positive.

Putting it all together: Positive factors include mention of cost hikes, improving stock performance, and positive ratings. Negative factors are subscriber losses, earnings misses, and missing subscribers. The overall sentiment seems to lean towards positive because there's a mix that suggests AMZN is doing well or has good news coming in."
2014-02-01,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets and figure out their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me take it step by step.

First, looking at each tweet individually. The first one mentions that Amazon's $ changes in shopping habits can affect Wal-mart. That seems like a minor point because Wal-mart is a competitor of Amazon, so changing consumer behavior could impact both companies. I don't think this affects Amazon directly here.

The second tweet says Amzn has ""nadir"" as better-known candidates for Microsoft's CEO. Again, Amzn isn't likely to significantly influence Amazon's stock price in the near term since they're competitors. This seems like a minor trade-off among their leadership positions but not something that would drive Amazon higher or lower.

The third tweet talks about Jeff Bezos winning faith of Wall Street with his ""prophet status"" at Amazon, mentioning moats, operating leverage, and pricing power. This is more positive because it highlights Amazon's strong fundamentals and competitive advantages. A positive tweet for a stock usually makes people buy more, which can boost the overall price.

Now, combining all these factors: The third tweet shows good news for Amazon's prospects with strong fundamentals, so that should contribute to a positive sentiment."
2014-02-02,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to figure out their impact on the stock price of Amazon's shares. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

First tweet: ""rt AT_USER average 50 % on every day trade 40 % returns in minutes video URL $ amzn $ spy"". The word ""spike"" is mentioned, which I think means a strong increase. So this looks positive. It seems like the user is talking about Amazon's performance.

Second tweet: ""rt AT_USER AT_USER $ bby worst company ever , i want to short it and buy $ amzn $. That sounds really exciting. Shorting the company suggests they're looking to bet on a decline, which might indicate panic selling or fear. So this could be positive because of the potential for higher prices.

Third tweet: ""rt AT_USER sb48 fans . please save our amazon store URL from auto shutdown from AT_USER $ amzn just need one sa …"". It seems like there's something negative here about Amazon, maybe due to technical issues or a glitch. The mention of saving the URL and avoiding an auto shutdown could be causing problems for the company. Negative.

Fourth tweet: ""rt AT_USER rt AT_USER open interest – february 7th expiration $ aapl $ amzn $ cmg $ fb $ goog $ nflx $ pcln $ tsla URL"". This is talking about option chains, which relate to trading strategies. It doesn't mention Amazon directly but talks about how the options are set up. Since it's discussing something that affects Amazon's stock indirectly, I'm not sure if this sentiment is positive or negative. Maybe a slight concern due to complex trading setups.

Fifth tweet: ""potential short plays : buy the break of the plod and place stops accordingly : $ amzn $ ups $ hes $ wmt $ xly $ cl $ bk"". This is talking about trading strategies, buying breaks in stock indices. It's not directly related to Amazon's performance but suggests an investment strategy. Maybe a mix of positive and neutral.

Sixth tweet: ""rt AT_USER share this to save our hard work . amazon $ amzn 1 purchase needed URL so AT_USER doesn't shut us down s …"". Similar to the third, there seems to be something negative about Amazon related to their stock price not shutting them down. Negative sentiment here too.

Putting it all together: Some tweets are positive (first and second), one is negative (third and sixth). The fourth and fifth seem a bit mixed but probably neutral since they're discussing options without directly impacting the main company's performance. So overall, there's both positive and negative, making the sentiment uncertain."
2014-02-03,Negative,"Alright, let's break down the problem step by step to determine the likely impact on Amazon's stock price based on the provided tweets.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. It seems like ""sb48"" is mentioned in some of them, but it might not be a known company symbol. Maybe it's a typo or refers to a specific index or something else entirely. Since the user didn't specify, I'll have to make an educated guess. Perhaps ""sb48"" is intended to represent Amazon or another well-known stock.

Next, for each tweet, I'll separate them into positive and negative factors. The tweets start with several that ask the user to save a URL for Amazon's store URL, which seems like a request for information rather than an explicit sentiment indicator. But some follow-up tweets have additional requests or updates. For example, one tweet asks about saving the URL from deleting auto-deletion, another suggests pulling back a potential opportunity against NFLX. These could indicate investor sentiment changes.

I notice that several tweets ask to save URLs, which might not directly impact the stock price but require information for trading purposes. The ones asking about returns or updates seem more positive and negative. The tweet with $ amzn URL mentions returns from daytrades viewers, which could be a positive sign of confidence in the stock's performance.

Another tweet adds money to a trading account and hedges against an investment account against holdings in NFLX. This indicates confidence in the stock's value but may not be enough on its own. The one suggesting that Amazon is in trouble mentions their financial issues, which could negatively impact the stock.

The last tweet asks for the URL of an opportunity pulled back against NFLX. While it's a specific trade request, it's unclear if this action would positively or negatively affect the company's performance. It might lead to further trading activity but isn't clear-cut.

Considering all these factors—positive requests for information, some positive about returns and updates, negative concerns about the company's financial status—the overall sentiment seems mixed. There are both supportive messages from users requesting information and some indication of confidence, while there are signs of potential issues or adjustments in their trading strategies.

However, without specific data on recent earnings, stock performance metrics, or other external factors affecting the market, it's challenging to assign a clear positive or negative score. The trends and sentiment seem inconclusive enough to leave the overall impact uncertain but not entirely negative either.

So, after evaluating each tweet's intent and context, I think the overall sentiment isn't strong enough to categorize as definitely positive, negative, or neutral."
2014-02-04,Negative,"Alright, so I need to analyze these tweets about Amazon's stock price and determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

Starting with the first tweet: ""$ amzn stock quote , 10:16 am : 349.98 +3.83 ( +1.11 % ) ."". This looks like a simple price quote from the stock exchange, so it's probably neutral because it's just providing information without any sentiment.

Moving to the second tweet: ""waited all day for the $ amzn selloff . didn't happen ( today ) . closed my weekly puts up 120 % . will look to re-short tomorrow ."" This seems negative. The user is talking about a sell-off they waited through, which suggests a downturn, and mentions losing money in their stock—this is likely a negative impact.

Third tweet: ""$ amzn - microsoft names engineering executive as new chief -> URL stock stocks stockaction."" This looks like an announcement from Microsoft to Amazon. I know Microsoft's stock has been down for a while, so if they're adding another executive, it could be a positive signal that Amazon is doing well. So this seems positive.

Fourth tweet: ""chegg needs to adapt ' AT_USER $ chgg $ amzn and $ spls steamrolling $ chgg . recent promotions show textbook rental prices cut ~ 25 % y / y '."" This is pretty technical, talking about GMAT updates and price cuts. GMAT is Amazon's GM (General Management), which has been under scrutiny. If they're cutting prices significantly, it could indicate a positive outcome or at least concern for revenue. It's tricky because the impact isn't clear, but I think this is more of a bearish point.

Fifth tweet: ""rt AT_USER laser targeted signals for powerful returns free webinar URL $ amzn $ spy."" The mention of a webinar with a rocket targeting powerful returns sounds like a positive announcement to the investors. It's encouraging them to participate and potentially see big gains, so this seems positive.

Sixth tweet: ""$ amzn - the names that are shaping retails revolution -> URL stock stocks stockaction."" This is a statement about Amazon renaming its products to shape retail revolutions. If their product line is changing direction, it could be a sign of growth or maybe even a negative if it affects margins. It's ambiguous but possibly positive in some areas.

Seventh tweet: ""killer daytrading strategies webinar this wed URL $ amzn $ fb."" Similar to the fifth tweet, mentioning a webinar for trading. It's encouraging potential traders, so this is likely positive news for Amazon's investors.

Putting it all together: The first tweet is neutral, the second is definitely negative due to the seller's perspective and loss. Then there are two positive tweets about technical developments and strategic announcements, which could be both positive and mixed. However, overall, considering the negative sentiment from the seller's reaction, I think the stock might have a negative impact."
2014-02-05,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. So, the user has provided two tweets about Amazon, specifically mentioning "" spy"" which I think refers to Amazon's symbol. 

First, I need to identify the target stock, which is Amazon, $AMZN. Each tweet is separate and needs to be analyzed individually.

Looking at the first tweet: ""high performance daytrading killer webinar URL $ amzn $ spy"". Hmm, this seems a bit off. ""Daytrading"" is more associated with platforms like Robinhood or MarketWatch, not webinars about trading strategies. The mention of a webinar and $amzn$spy might be referring to a discount on both Amazon and the target stock. But since $spy$ is usually a typo for $AMZN$, I should correct that. So maybe it's ""high performance daytrading killer webinar"" without the typo.

The tweet seems promotional or informative, talking about the webinar. This could attract more investors to engage with the stock, which might influence sentiment positively if there's buzz and mentions of higher trading volumes or increased interest in Amazon.

Now the second tweet: ""precision trade entries using options watch video URL $ amzn $ spy"". Similar issue here— precision trades options, but again, typo. It looks like a video promoting a webinar about precise trades using options on Amazon stock. This could be another way to attract more investors by suggesting actionable strategies or methods.

So both tweets are promotional in nature, discussing webinars and trading strategies. Promotional content often increases investor interest and sentiment towards the company. High-quality promotional materials can lead to higher trading volumes, which in turn can increase stock price. Therefore, these tweets should be classified as positive because they contribute to building investor confidence and encouraging more actions."
2014-02-06,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to analyze the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet says the average user is 50% and mentions killer webinars. That sounds positive about their event, so that's a good sign.

2. The second tweet repeats the same average but focuses on Wednesday instead of today. It also mentions the same stock symbol. Consistent positive language suggests strong sentiment.

3. Third tweet talks about Amazon putting image recognition into its iOS app and preparing to be more Shelied. This is strategic, so it adds confidence in their tech strategy.

4. The fourth tweet mentions a price target of $353 and says they need to get through it. It's serious but not necessarily negative because it's a specific number. It might push some investors to buy, though.

5. The fifth tweet mentions double helix, which was the killer instinct project. This is a significant event in their history, so positive news about a major product being acquired could boost their reputation and stock price.

6. The sixth tweet says they bought Game-It, which is related to Double Helix. This further reinforces Amazon's position as a tech leader, indicating continued optimism.

7. The seventh tweet talks about signals for returns and attending a webinar. It's strategic selling, which can be seen as cautious but positive because it shows focus on the right topics.

8. The last tweet says the user agrees with their valuation at $10, not more, and points out technical insolvency. This is a bit concerning because they are spending too much money on creditors. However, the overall trend seems mixed since some tweets are positive while others are negative or neutral.

Putting it all together, the positive tweets highlight growth, innovation, and strategic investments. The negative tweet about insolvency could have a minor impact but still ties into Amazon's financial health. Considering all these factors, I think the sentiment is mostly positive overall."
2014-02-07,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price based on the given rules. The user has provided four tweets, and each tweet seems related to Amazon with some hashtags included.

First, let me identify the target stock from the first tweet: ""fnma"". Wait, no, that's Facebook. Hmm, maybe it's a typo or something else. Looking back at the output examples, the target stock was ""amzn"", which is Amazon. So I think each tweet mentions AMZN, so I'll use that as the target.

Now, for each tweet, I need to identify Positive and Negative factors. Let me take them one by one.

1. Tweet 1: ""$ fnma last trade get started here : URL also see $ lbtyk $ awre $ amzn $ cimt"". The hashtags used are FB (Facebook), LBTC (Leverage Brief - maybe referring to leveraged trading trends?), AWRE, and AMZN. So factors here might be Facebook's recent activity, leveraged trading trends, Amazon's presence. Not sure about the sentiment yet.

2. Tweet 2: ""$ amzn amazon tests brazils retail jungle with its kindle URL"". The hashtags are AMZN (Amazon), BRZ (Brazzers - maybe a typo for Brazilian stock?), KIDLE (Kindle - e-commerce? Maybe not directly related). So factors here could be Amazon's testing, but I'm not sure about the sentiment.

3. Tweet 3: ""create your own movie studio - amazon and netflix trend - the value is creation of content and doing it well - next step :d istribution $ amzn"". The hashtags are AMZN, NFE (Netflix), CONVEY (content), DIS (distribution). So factors here include Amazon focusing on creating content, Netflix trends affecting Amazon's distribution. Could be positive if Amazon is a leader in both.

4. Tweet 4: ""rt AT_USER i'm pumped first watchlist for tomorrow is up via AT_USER $ amzn $ nflx $ goog URL"". The hashtags are AMZN (Amazon), NFLX (Nflx - probably Nflx, not NFLX?), GOOG (Google). So factors here might be increasing interest in Amazon's stock, but the link goes to NFLX and Google. Maybe positive if more people are watching.

Now, I need to assess each tweet's sentiment on Amazon's stock. Let me think about each one:

1. Tweet 1 mentions Facebook, which is a major player in social media. But it doesn't directly relate to Amazon. So maybe neutral or slight positive, since the link could be for various reasons.

2. Tweet 2 talks about testing and kindle products, but not directly about Amazon's performance. Maybe moderate negative if other factors are affecting investor sentiment negatively.

3. Tweet 3 seems focused on content creation and distribution, which Amazon is known for. This could be a positive factor as it supports the company's growth. So this tweet is positive.

4. Tweet 4 mentions watching the stock watchlist and links to NFLX and Google. If someone is pumped about Amazon, maybe that's a positive sign, but if NFLX isn't a tech stock, it might not directly affect Amazon. However, since they're watching the market, it could be positive overall.

Putting it all together: Tweet 3 is clearly positive for Amazon. The others are mixed or potentially negative, especially if other factors like social media links (tweet 1) could be misleading or unrelated.

So I think overall sentiment is positive because one tweet supports Amazon's growth and strategy."
2014-02-08,Neutral,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of Amazon.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. The words ""AT_USER"" and the hashtags like ""precision trade entries using options must attend webinar URL $ amzn $ spy"" suggest that the stock in question is Amazon (AMZN).

Now, looking at each tweet individually:

1. ""rt AT_USER precision trade entries using options must attend webinar URL $ am zn $ spy"" – This seems to be a general mention of attending a webinar about precision trades and options related to Amazon's stock. It doesn't provide specific details on what happens in the webinar or any action taken by Amazon.

2. ""rt AT_USER high performance daytrading webinar on wednesday URL $ am zn $ spy"" – Similar structure, mentioning a day trading webinar focused on high performance strategies. Again, no specifics about what's being discussed or the outcome of the webinar.

Since both tweets are general and don't provide any information that can be attributed to Amazon, it's challenging to determine their impact on the stock price. They might relate to the company's strategy or events but lack concrete details, making it hard to assess positivity, neutrality, or negativity."
2014-02-09,Positive,"Okay, I need to figure out how the provided tweets affect the stock price of Amazon (AMZN) and determine whether it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

First, looking at the target stock symbol AMZN. None of the provided tweets mention AMZN directly, so maybe that part isn't relevant here since we're focusing on the given stocks: take-two, zynga, electron, spy. But I should check if these companies are related or if there's something else I'm missing.

Now, analyzing each tweet. 

The first tweet says, ""$ amzn - this emerging trend could lift shares of take-two , zynga , and electron ... -> URL stock stocks stockaction"". So it mentions a trend that could potentially increase the prices of three companies: take-two, zynga, and electron. This sounds like a positive factor because a favorable trend could boost their performance.

The second tweet is ""rt AT_USER average 50 % on every daytrade check out trade URL $ amzn $ spy"". It's an RT message from a user saying the average daily trade percentage on AMZN and SPY (which I believe is another stock) is 50%. High trading volume often indicates investor sentiment towards a company, so this seems positive. The mention of 50% average suggests strong demand or confidence in the company's performance.

The third tweet is ""trades making 80 to 100 % daily free trial sign up now URL $ amzn $ spy"". It talks about making 80-100% daily, which indicates a high trading volume. This again points towards strong investor interest and probably positive sentiment for AMZN.

So putting it all together: the first tweet mentions multiple companies positively, the second and third both show high trading volumes. All these signals point to an upward trend in the stock prices of the mentioned stocks. Therefore, the overall sentiment is positive."
2014-02-10,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price based on the given criteria. Let me start by understanding the process.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the tweets, most include ""amzn"" or mention it directly. So I can assume the target stock is Amazon.

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate Positive and Negative factors. The tweets seem neutral on their own, but they might influence investor sentiment based on other factors.

I also need to assess each tweet's overall sentiment. Each of these tweets says something about what to expect in terms of trade ideas or app features related to Amazon's stock. They don't mention the company's performance or specific news affecting its price.

The user provided a list, but I noticed that multiple tweets are similar—like ""rt AT_USER wild week ahead -..."" repeating on multiple lines. The last tweet mentions ""couple of stocks to watch $ amzn cafi lts ge view now URL."" This might imply Amazon's performance is being discussed, possibly due to an app launch or feature.

However, without specific news or earnings reports, analyst calls, or direct financial statements, I can't assess the positive or negative impact on Amazon's stock. The tweets are more about discussing opportunities in the market rather than providing information that would affect a company's price.

Since there's no concrete data or specific news from these tweets, it's challenging to determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative regarding Amazon's stock. They might influence sentiment by creating buzz or discussion but don't directly impact the price."
2014-02-11,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of Amzn, Inc., also known as Amazon. So, first, I need to analyze each tweet step by step.

Starting with the first tweet: It mentions the ""wild week ahead"" and lists a bunch of stocks that trade ideas and hedging. The user seems to be predicting some kind of event or upcoming news related to Amzn. That could indicate a positive outlook since they're focusing on potential changes in the market direction. But then, I see another tweet right after it with ""rt AT_USER wild week ahead - what..."" which is similar. So both tweets are talking about the same thing. That makes me think they might be consolidating information or reinforcing each other.

Next, looking at the other tweets: The fifth and sixth tweets just repeat the initial prompt again. There's a tweet from George Packer that mentions a 17-year launch for Amzn, which could hint at growth potential. Then there are more positive tweets about future trends in different sectors like retail, tech, etc. These seem to be adding support for Amzn by highlighting various sectors that might influence the company.

The following tweets mention selling suggestions: ""shoud you sell $ xray $ lpth $ hiw $ amzn visit URL"" and another with a link to a website. This could imply interest from investors looking to exit their positions, which usually signals positive news about the stock price.

Looking at the last few tweets, some are repeating similar messages again, reinforcing the positive outlook. There's also a tweet encouraging readers to visit a specific URL for more information or actions. That might be promoting engagement or informational content related to Amzn's future performance.

Now, putting this together: The tweets are talking about the market's potential, including future events, product launches, and sectors that could impact Amzn. There's also some selling pressure from investors looking to exit their positions. All these elements suggest a positive outlook on Amazon stock. They're providing information that could boost investor confidence, which usually leads to a positive sentiment.

So overall, combining all the factors—positive news, mentions of future trends, potential product launches, and interest from sell offers—it seems like the tweets are collectively supporting a positive impact on Amazon's stock price."
2014-02-12,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze the given tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of Amazon (AMZN). Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. It seems all tweets mention AMZN, so that's straightforward—AMZN is our focus here.

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate Positive and Negative factors. That means going through each sentence and labeling them accordingly. Let me go through them one by one.

1. ""if gundlach thinks $ cmg pe of 50 baffles the mind , whats $ amzn pe of 500 do for him ?"" - This is a bit confusing, but it seems like it's questioning something about AMZN's performance or price. It's unclear whether this is positive or negative, but it might be neutral.

2. ""AT_USER way to go ! here is why URL you are leading your $ amzn $ exc 84dca takethisbet"" - This tweet seems to express appreciation and offer something (URL) for AMZN stock at a discount. It's promotional and positive, so that should be a strong Positive sentiment.

3. ""$ am zn barnes & noble should have stuck to its knitting URL"" - This one is more about the company name and suggesting it stick with their approach. While this might imply support or positivity regarding AMZN, the phrasing isn't clear enough for a definite conclusion—maybe Neutral.

4. ""rt AT_USER trades produce 100 % same day free trial sign up now URL $ amzn $ spy"" - This seems like a promotion offering a deal on AMZN stock, which is typically seen as positive because it's selling services or products. Positive sentiment here should kick in.

5. ""$ am zn - amazon to hire 2,500 across u . s . -> URL stock stocks stockaction"" - Here, the tweet mentions hiring thousands of workers and suggests using their stock for actions like buying stocks or something else. This is positive because it's about increasing employment, which can boost AMZN. Positive sentiment.

6. ""nothing like a downgrade in a market down day . $ am zn"" - This comment seems negative since it's describing a market downturn without any positive response. So this tweet is likely Negative.

7. ""are you buying $ igt $ gxp $ lxk $ am zn wallstreet URL"" - This is a query asking if someone wants to buy AMZN stock on Wall Street. While interesting, it doesn't provide direct information about the stock's price impact—more of a suggestion. So Neutral.

8. ""$ stocks to buy $ im $ dis $ amzn singidelInvestor URL"" - Similar to the previous one, this is another query promoting buying stock without giving details on the stock's performance. It's speculative and doesn't offer positive or negative info.

Now, let me summarize each tweet's sentiment:

1. Neutral
2. Positive
3. Neutral
4. Positive
5. Positive
6. Negative
7. Neutral
8. Speculative, so maybe Neutral

To get an overall sentiment, I need to count the positives and negatives. I have 5 Positives from tweets 2,4,5, and two Neutral ones. The negative tweet is number 6. Since there are more positive tweets than negative, but with some neutral in between, it leans towards Positive.

I should avoid being too confident. It's not a clear majority yet, so the overall sentiment might be leaning towards Positive."
2014-02-13,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First tweet says ""amzn falls"" but provides some specific information about prime survey and piper reviews for January. It seems like this could be an update on Amazon's financials or industry developments, which might affect investor sentiment. However, without more details, it's hard to tell if it's positive or negative.

Second tweet mentions trading at 100% on the same day with a ""get free"" offer for stocks over a week and references spy. This sounds like a promotion, possibly boosting investor interest in Amazon, which could be positive.

Third tweet talks about private enterprise firms in Venezuela, citing AT_USER venezuelanbonds and GM. This is likely related to business strategy or economic indicators that Amazon might interpret as favorable news. It's speculative, but it might influence sentiment positively.

Fourth tweet repeats the same content from the third one. Since it's a duplicate, it doesn't add new information, so I can ignore this.

Fifth tweet discusses an newsletter by IPGP, RLGY, and BLL. These are likely financial indicators or market trends that could impact Amazon. It might indicate a shift in strategy or market conditions, which is neutral unless more info is provided.

Sixth tweet details research on stocks with companies like MHK, HMC, MCHP, etc., and mentions AMZN. This sounds like positive news about the company's performance, which would likely be positive for Amazon's stock.

Now, combining these thoughts: some tweets are promotional (second, third), others are about business trends (third, fourth), and one is positive research (sixth). Without concrete data from the first tweet beyond fall updates, it's a bit uncertain. The overall sentiment seems mixed but leaning towards positive because of the promotional news and positive research."
2014-02-14,Negative,"Alright, I need to figure out the likely impact on the stock price based on these tweets. Let me start by identifying each tweet and evaluating their impact.

1. ""watch : are wal-mart and target close to accepting bitcoin payments ? URL $ wmt $ tgt $ xlp $ xrt $ amzn"" - The user is asking about whether Wal-Mart and Target accept Bitcoin payments, which could affect the valuation of Bitcoin or related companies like AMZN. This seems speculative but might indicate a concern about market dynamics.

2. ""should you buy $ msft $ penn $ ndsn $ amzn worth a look URL"" - Here, they're mentioning Microsoft and penn (which might be pennell grange) and Amazon. I know penn isn't a real company, so this tweet is likely negative because it's not grounded in facts.

3. ""AT_USER $ twtr ben struck is "" musing on markets "" and should not be interpreted as advice . his twitter header . $ twtr $ amzn"" - The user is talking about Twitter user Ben striking a message as a joke, which seems off-topic. It doesn't provide any information that would affect the stock price positively or negatively.

4. ""rt AT_USER triple digit returns from daytrades free alerts for a week try now URL $ amzn $ spy"" - This tweet mentions AMZN getting free alerts with a triple-digit return rate and plans to switch to SPY, which is another ETF. If there are no positive developments, this could be negative.

5. ""$ amzn best buy vs . amazon : the battle no one will win URL"" - Comparing Amazon to Apple, where Apple wins, might indicate support for Apple's valuation relative to Amazon. But without context, it's hard to tell if this is positive or negative.

6. ""keeping my eye on $ pru $ agn $ lxk $ amzn worth a look URL"" - The user is mentioning companies like Pru (possibly a typo), Agn, and LXK. This seems unrelated to AMZN unless they're referring to other sectors. No direct impact on stock price.

7. ""should you buy $ foxa $ dd $ abc $ amzn stockmarket URL"" - FoxA isn't a recognized company; likely a typo or misspelling. This tweet is negative due to the undefined company name.

8. ""$ amzn amzn URL"" - Another reference to AMZN without context, possibly another typo. It's unclear if this leads to any positive movement.

9. ""get stock market reports on $ amzn $ dbd $ m $ rt nasdaq URL"" - Mentioning NASDAQ and a placeholder for DBD. This could imply monitoring the stock but no direct impact unless it points to a specific area.

10. ""$ amzn and $ lnkd look unhappy"" - Here, both Amazon andlnkd (which might be lntel) seem unprofitable or underperforming. If they're being ignored because of their poor performance, this could lead to negative sentiment for AMZN.

11. ""rt AT_USER netflix coming up aces with ' house of cards ' season premiere URL $ nflx $ twx $ amzn URL"" - While Netflix's success is positive, the tweet suggests that their season premiere may affect AMZN indirectly. It might cause some uncertainty but doesn't directly impact AMZN's valuation.

Considering all these tweets, the most negative ones are 2, 4, and 7, which don't provide actionable information or support for stock movements. The others seem speculative or unrelated, leading to a somewhat neutral overall sentiment."
2014-02-15,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for a given company. So, I'm looking at a set of tweets where each tweet is separate, and I need to assess whether each one affects the overall sentiment positively, neutrally, or negatively.

First, I see that the user provided four tweets, but only the first one seems relevant because the others don't seem to relate to stock performance. The first tweet is: ""small-cap stocks setting new 52 - wk high prices $ stj $ nu $ lkq $ amzn singedinvestor URL"". Hmm, I need to parse this.

Looking at it, it mentions small-cap stocks hitting a new 52-week high and mentions some dollars in different languages, which might be typo-related. It also includes ""singedinvestor"", which is an investment service. The key part here seems to indicate that the stock is rising. Maybe ""new 52 - wk high prices"" suggests that over the past 52 weeks, these stocks are at a higher price than before.

But wait, the other tweets are in the user's profile and don't seem to mention any positive or negative aspects about the company's performance. So maybe each of these tweets is just mentioning something unrelated to the stock? Or perhaps they're all from different companies?

Assuming that each tweet could be related to a different stock, but without more context on what the stocks are, it's hard to assess their impact. But since I have to choose between [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative], and only one tweet is provided, maybe I should consider how impactful any single tweet can be.

Alternatively, perhaps each tweet represents a quote from an individual that they believe positively affects the stock price, but without knowing the tweets' context, it's challenging. Maybe the user wants to know if there are multiple positive or neutral or negative factors contributing to the stock's performance.

Wait, looking back, the user provided four tweets, and in the output, only one is relevant. So maybe each of these represents different quotes from investors, some positive, some neutral, etc. But without knowing what the stocks are, it's hard to assess.

Alternatively, perhaps all these tweets are about the same stock but phrased differently. The first tweet mentions a rise in small-cap stocks, which might indicate investor confidence or expectation of better performance.

But considering that each tweet is separate, maybe I should focus on whether they have any positive, negative, or neutral indicators. For instance, if one tweet says ""Company's revenue is expected to grow,"" that would be positive. But the tweets provided don't specify anything specific except their general content.

Wait, perhaps these are quotes from different investors discussing the stock. Maybe each tweet has a different point about what investors believe about the stock. If they're all optimistic, neutral, or pessimistic, then I can sum them up.

But since I don't have specific information on each tweet's content beyond the first one, which mentions a rise in small-cap stocks, maybe it's better to consider that each tweet could be either positive or negative based on their statements. But without knowing if they're positive about the stock or not, it's ambiguous.

Given that only four tweets are provided and perhaps only one is relevant, I might have to make an assumption here. Since the first tweet mentions a rise in small-cap stocks, which could indicate investor expectation of higher prices, maybe that's a positive signal. But without more context on how the other tweets are phrased, it's hard to conclude.

Alternatively, maybe all these tweets are about different companies or different aspects, so I can't determine the overall impact on a single stock unless there's some pattern or recurring sentiment across multiple tweets.

But since each tweet is separate, perhaps the user wants me to analyze one tweet and assume that it represents the company in question. So if the first tweet mentions small-cap stocks setting new 52-week highs, that might suggest confidence in their performance, leading to a positive sentiment. But other factors like the URL ""singedinvestor"" could be a typo or irrelevant.

In conclusion, without more context on what each tweet is about and how they relate to the stock, it's challenging to determine the overall impact. However, focusing on the first tweet which mentions rising small-cap stocks might indicate an expectation of better performance, so I'll go with [Positive]."
2014-02-16,Positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative in terms of their impact on a company's stock price. The given tweets are:

1. ""triple digit returns from daytrades free trial now URL $ amzn $ spy""
2. ""looking for winners like $ mnk $ dd $ xyl $ amzn worth a look URL""

First, I'll identify the target stock. Both tweets mention Amazon (AMZN), so that's our focus.

Starting with the first tweet: It says there are triple-digit returns from daytrades' free trial, which brings ""AMZN $ spy"" to $something. The phrase ""triple digit returns"" suggests significant gains or profits. ""Free trial"" could mean they're offering a free trial period, but it doesn't directly relate to Amazon's performance yet.

The mention of ""AMZN $ spy"" makes me think about the stock price movements in general, not just individual tweets. The wordplay here could be that AMZN is trading at similar prices, which might affect investors expecting them to rise or fall together.

Next, the second tweet highlights ""winners like MNK, DD, XYL with AMZN."" These are commonly known cryptocurrencies—MNT is Bitcoin, DDD is Dogecoin, and XYL is Trezor. The fact that these crypto projects are being discussed alongside Amazon could influence investor sentiment on Amazon's stock.

Now, combining the two tweets, they're both talking about trends in tech companies related to AMZN. ""Triple digit returns"" sounds positive because it implies significant gains, which can boost a stock's value. The crypto mentions might indicate that there's interest or expectations from other investors, adding to the overall sentiment.

I'm leaning towards a positive overall sentiment here because each tweet is pointing towards potential positives in tech-related stocks, and the keywords include ""triple digit"" (positive) and references to trends and optimism (also positive). The crypto mentions might be a bit speculative but contribute to investor interest."
2014-02-17,Neutral,"Alright, let's analyze the given tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user has provided two tweets, and I need to figure out if they are positive, neutral, or negative.

First, I'll start by identifying the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""thinking of investing in $ afl $ eqr $ cbt $ amzn i suggest URL"". Hmm, that looks like a typo because ""$ afl$..."" doesn't make sense for an abbreviation. Maybe it's supposed to be something else. Without knowing what AFCF is, I can't really determine the stock symbol or company name here.

Moving on to the second tweet: ""this weeks stocks to watch $ amzn $ ba $ tso $ fxy financialnews URL"". Again, these abbreviations don't correspond to any known company symbols. It's unclear which companies are being referred to by these codes. Without more context, it's impossible to identify the specific stock or even the ones mentioned.

Since I can't extract a target stock from either tweet, I can't perform an in-depth analysis on their impact. The user hasn't provided any details about what AFCF stands for or which companies are involved here. This makes it difficult to assess whether these tweets positively, neutrally, or negatively affect the stock price.

I should consider that if there's no target stock identified, I can't proceed with an assessment. It's possible the user might have made a typo in the abbreviations. Maybe AFCF is meant to be something like ""Apple"", but I'm not certain. If so, without knowing the stock name, it's still challenging.

However, the output requirement expects me to conclude with one of three tags: [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Since no target stock can be identified, perhaps the safest assumption is that the impact isn't discernible from the given information. So, I might end up categorizing this as [Neutral] because without any concrete data points, it's hard to gauge a clear sentiment.

But wait, maybe the user intended for AFCF to stand for something else or there's an expectation of recognizing that no action is taken regarding investing in these stocks. If so, perhaps they're suggesting to watch certain companies, which would lean towards [Positive] because it encourages investment. However, without knowing the context, I'm speculating here.

In any case, since I can't extract a target stock, I think the best approach is to state that no information has been identified, leading me to conclude with [Neutral]."
2014-02-18,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to figure out if they'll impact the stock price positively, neutrally, or negatively for a given company. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I see that each tweet is about some event. The target stock symbol isn't specified, but from the first tweet, it seems like Amazon is involved because of ""amzn"" and mentions getting started with a day high. So, I'm assuming the target stock is Amazon.

Now, for each tweet, I need to separate them into positive and negative factors. Let's look at each one:

1. ""$ amzn day high get started here : URL also see $ cytr $ spli $ aegy $ poil""

This looks like a link or navigation instruction. It doesn't seem positive or negative about Amazon; it might just be directing someone to something else.

2. ""A big move for the market, but I'm not sure if the stock is up or down? Maybe the tech sector is heating up.""

Hmm, this tweet is expressing uncertainty about whether the stock will go up or down and mentions the tech sector. It's a bit vague, but it seems like Amazon might still be in the rung somewhere.

3. ""$ cytr $ spli $ aegy $ poil""

These look like domain names. They could be unrelated to Amazon or each other, so this tweet doesn't seem positive or negative on the stock.

Putting it all together, none of these tweets are very specific about Amazon's performance. They're mostly directions or statements of uncertainty without concrete information. So, overall sentiment is likely neutral."
2014-02-19,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company called AmZN (Amazon). The user has provided four tweets, each with some information or analysis about AmZN. My task is to go through each tweet, assess its impact on the stock, and then sum it up into one overall sentiment: Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

First, let me list out the tweets:

1. ""expect time warner / comcast cable to offer netflix URL $ nflx $ cmcs $ twc $ amzn""
2. ""p & l today was down 214 on cuz $ nflx got some back on $ amzn calling it quits today URL""
3. "" insider selling : jeffrey a . wilke unloads 11,662 shares of URL stock $ amzn URL""
4. ""$ amzn chart by gamblin : URL nanakorobi yaoki : this one looks like it's going south.""

Alright, starting with the first tweet: ""expect time warner / comcast cable to offer netflix URL $ nflx $ cmcs $ twc $ amzn."" This seems like an informational tweet. It mentions that certain companies are offering URLs related to netflix and AmZN. I'm not sure what this means exactly, but it's a call for more information about the future of time warner or comcast. Since it's just providing details without predicting a specific outcome, maybe it doesn't directly affect stock prices much.

Moving on to tweet 2: ""p & l today was down 214 on cuz $ nflx got some back on $ amzn calling it quits today URL."" This one is more informative again. It mentions the company's profits dropped by 214 cents and then talks about them getting some returns, even calling it quits. While this does mention a drop in profits, which might be a negative indicator for investors, it also doesn't specifically state that AmZN's stock will decrease or improve. So this tweet is somewhat speculative but not definitive.

Next, tweet 3: ""inside selling : jeffrey a . wilke unloads 11,662 shares of URL stock $ amzn URL."" This is an insider selling tweet. It indicates that Jeffrey Wilke is selling a significant number of shares. From the word choice and the specific number, this seems like a clear indicator of negative news about AmZN's future performance because insider trading usually affects investor sentiment negatively.

Finally, tweet 4: ""$ amzn chart by gamblin : URL nanakorobi yaoki : this one looks like it's going south."" This is a cryptic tweet that translates to a call for the stock to go south. The word ""south"" in stock charts often indicates a significant downward trend, which could lead investors to buy more shares or sell their existing ones.

Now, putting it all together:

- Tweet 1: Provides info without predicting outcome.
- Tweet 2: Suggests a drop in profits but doesn't make a strong prediction for AmZN's future.
- Tweet 3: Clear insider selling that could lead to negative sentiment.
- Tweet 4: Words like ""going south"" imply potential stock price decline.

Since the third tweet explicitly mentions insider selling, which is a significant signal that investors are worried about AmZN's performance and may be reducing their holdings. The fourth tweet adds more weight on this possibility due to its use of a negative chart indicator.

Therefore, combining these factors, especially considering the insider selling and the downward trend in profits, it seems like there is negative sentiment around AmZN. This could lead to a decline in stock price despite other positive mentions from the first and third tweets."
2014-02-20,Negative,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. The first tweet mentions $ gwr $ de and $ dei $ amzn wealthmanagement URL. Hmm, that seems a bit unclear. Maybe they're referencing something like Google (GOOGL) or Apple (AAPL)? But ""wealthmanagement"" doesn't ring a bell for these companies. I'll hold on to that for now.

The second tweet is about ""whats happening with $ lnc $ amzn $ usm $ qlys must see URL"". Again, this seems fragmented. Maybe they're referring to LNCS (Long Term Capitalsecurity), but I'm not sure. It could be related to Amazon too since the stock price is mentioned multiple times. 

The third tweet says, ""AT_USER speaking of $ amzn , is it a buy considering it's fall from the all time high ?"" This seems more approachable. It suggests that the user is considering buying Amazon because they think it's near its all-time high. So, focusing on AMZN.

Now, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. 

The first tweet mentions GWR (I'm not sure what that stands for) and DEI (another term I'm unfamiliar with). Without context, it's hard to assess the sentiment. Maybe they're making a vague statement about future directions.

The second tweet is about LNC, AMZN, USM, and QLYs. Again, unclear terms. It might be related to Amazon's financial status or some other topic. I'm not certain about this one either.

The third tweet is more specific: mentioning that the user thinks it's falling from a high and considering buying. This seems like an explicit suggestion to buy AMZN because they think it's heading downward. 

Considering all three, each tweet has different elements. The third one explicitly tells the reader to consider a purchase based on a potential rise in price. However, without knowing if this sentiment affects others or how much impact it might have, I can't be certain.

I'm leaning towards that since there are multiple tweets suggesting a buy and mentioning something about a high, but each tweet is isolated and may not all contribute the same positive signal to Amazon's stock."
2014-02-21,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. The user provided five tweets and asked me to analyze them using a scoring system where each tweet can be positive, neutral, or negative. Let me break down each tweet one by one.

First, the target stock is Amazon (AMZN). That’s clear from the first step in my solving process. Now, I need to go through each tweet to assess what they're saying and whether that has a positive, neutral, or negative effect on AMZN's stock.

Starting with the first tweet: ""Amazon tempts the anti-amazons with offers to showcase their goods URL $ amzn retail."" Hmm, this sounds promotional. They’re talking about showcasing goods and maybe giving them away? But I'm not sure what that means for Amazon's performance. Maybe it's trying to build a good reputation or something else, but without more context, it’s hard to tell if this is positive or negative.

Second tweet: ""$ amzn some evening reading about cash flows and profits . cash is a fact profit is an opinion URL bearish."" This seems like a market analysis. It mentions cash being a fact and profit being an opinion, which is pretty neutral. But the term ""bearish"" might imply that people are worried or negative about something—maybe Amazon's performance? However, without specific details on what's causing this sentiment, it's ambiguous.

Third tweet: ""AT_USER had a good trading week ? all i did was write one option , added a little $ amzn . I thought i could see some increase . This sounds like an encouraging message. It says they just wrote something and made a small move, which is positive. So this tweet suggests that AMZN is doing well.

Fourth tweet: ""$ twtr twitter to release server orders to taiwan odms URL $ dell $ ibm $ goog $ amzn."" Again, it's making predictions about specific companies. It mentions releasing server orders from Taiwan to ODM (Optimized deliver-or-shipman). I don't have enough info on this topic—maybe it's about supply chain issues or something? Without knowing how this affects Amazon directly, it's hard to assess the sentiment.

Fifth tweet: ""$ axp $ tsco $ mgee $ amzn $ usd economy URL."" This is a mix of multiple stocks and mentions an economic outlook. It looks like they're talking about broader market trends rather than specific stock performance. Without knowing how this affects Amazon, it's speculative.

Now, putting it all together. The first tweet seems promotional but not giving clear information. The second is speculative with market analysis. The third is encouraging, implying positive sentiment. The fourth and fifth are speculative as well. So the main positive tweet is number three, which might suggest a positive impact on AMZN's stock. But I'm not entirely sure because there could be hidden factors or context I'm missing."
2014-02-22,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about Amazon's stock price impact.

First, I need to identify each tweet separately. The first tweet is ""$ amzn URL inc . ( amzn ) may start listing merchandise from j . crew URL"". Hmm, the user mentions that Amazon might list merchandise starting from June 1st on the j.Crew website. This seems like a positive sign for Amazon's inventory and possibly their revenue streams because they'll be selling more products.

The second tweet is ""is ' ship from store ' the answer to retailers ' amazon problem ? URL vía AT_USER $ amzn $ bby $ wmt $ gps $ jwn $ cs"". The user asks if shipping from the store can answer a retailer's problem. It seems like this could be a sales or promotional question, which might indicate that Amazon is addressing customer needs or boosting their reputation online.

Now, for each tweet, I'll extract factors and assess sentiment. For the first tweet, the positive factor is increased merchandise listing starting June 1st, which directly ties into Amazon's revenue. So that's definitely a positive indicator. The negative factor isn't present here because it doesn't mention any issues. 

Looking at the second tweet, it's more about customer feedback and addressing a problem. This could lead to positive sentiment if customers are happy with their online shopping experience or solutions. However, I don't see any strong negative comments in this tweet.

Combining these, both tweets suggest that Amazon is facing a challenge but also potentially offering solutions. The primary positive factor comes from the merchandise listing, which boosts revenue, so the overall sentiment should be positive."
2014-02-23,Neutral,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how these tweets impact the stock price of $ aos. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. The first tweet mentions ""$ aos $ tho $ brcd $ amzn overvalued URL"". That seems a bit confusing because the user wrote ""$ aos $ tho $ brcd $ amzn"". Maybe that's a typo or a mistake in capitalization? I should probably look for two-letter stock symbols, so perhaps it's ""AAL"" which stands for American Airlines. But I'm not entirely sure; maybe there's another symbol here.

The second tweet says ""$ amzn 5 tycoons who want to close the wealth gap URL"". Hmm, again, some words are in uppercase letters, and URLs aren't clear. Maybe it's referring to Amazon (AMZN) since that's a common stock symbol? So I'll tentatively assume both tweets are related to Amazon.

Next, I need to separate positive and negative factors for each tweet. For the first tweet about $ aos, I'm not sure what ""tho"" refers to. Maybe it's an acronym for something like ""to share""? If so, that could be neutral or possibly positive if ""overvalued"" was a bit misleading. However, without context, it's hard to say.

For the second tweet on Amazon, ""5 tycoons who want to close the wealth gap"" might indicate that 5 top companies are pushing for reducing the wealth gap. That sounds like good news because it shows support among influential individuals or large corporations, which generally boosts investor sentiment. 

Now, assessing sentiment: The first tweet mentions an overvalued URL and ""tho"", but since it's unclear what that stands for, I'm not sure if that adds to a positive or negative view. If ""overvalued"" is misleading or just redundant, it might be neutral. On the other hand, if they're referring to Amazon being overvalued in some way, maybe there could be a slight negative impact.

The second tweet seems more direct and shows support among key players, which is positive for Amazon's stock price because companies often rise when supported by major companies.

When combining both tweets, though, the second one gives a strong boost with 5 tycoons. The first tweet's ambiguity makes it harder to say much about the other factor. But overall, the positive factors are more significant than the negative ones in this case.

So, considering the clear positive sentiment from the second tweet and a possible neutral or slightly negative from the first, but leaning towards positive overall, I think the stock is likely going up."
2014-02-24,Negative,"Alright, I need to determine the impact of the provided tweets on the future stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the target stock. The user didn't specify which stock, so perhaps it's not crucial for determining sentiment because the focus is more on evaluating each tweet independently rather than referencing specific stocks.

Starting with the first tweet: ""AT_USER AT_USER $ ebay or $ amzn would make more sense."" This seems like a user posting advice, suggesting that investing in either eBay or Amazon could be beneficial. The mention of two companies and offering guidance to invest suggests positive energy about stock options. So, this seems positive.

Now, the second tweet: ""should you buy $ wr $ hrl $ atml $ amzn goto URL."" This is an attempt to trigger a purchase action for several stocks and mentions ""goto"" which could mean clicking or navigating somewhere else on the platform. This action might indicate that the user believes there's a move or plan related to these companies, possibly causing an increase in interest or volume around them. So, this tweet seems like it's signaling potential buying activity.

Putting it together: The first tweet is positive, encouraging more investment and discussion about options. The second tweet is negative because it looks for actions that could trigger buying, which might be a signal of a push towards those stocks, possibly increasing their trading volume or interest. Combining these two factors would result in an overall negative sentiment as the user is actively suggesting investments but also looking to buy something.

However, I need to consider that sometimes user posts can be ambiguous or context-dependent. The first tweet's prompt could be interpreted either positively (suggesting possible stock options) or negatively if implying that the user doesn't want to invest. But since it says ""would make more sense,"" which is a bit vague but leans towards positive, I'll lean towards positive for this tweet.

The second tweet seems like an attempt to get users to buy certain stocks, which can sometimes be seen as negative because it's actively encouraging purchases, even if the impact isn't specified. But since it involves ""goto URL"" which might suggest navigating elsewhere on the platform where more buying is likely, the sentiment might still lean towards negative.

Given both factors, I have some positive and mixed negative influences. It depends on how the overall tone combines these elements. If it's just the first tweet pushing investment, that's a strong positive. The second tweet adding another layer could make the sentiment slightly negative if people are more likely to buy due to triggering actions. But without knowing exactly what ""goto URL"" means in this context, it's hard to be certain.

In conclusion, considering both factors together, the overall sentiment seems to lean towards negative because of the potential for increased buying volume even though there are positive suggestions about investments."
2014-02-25,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets about Tesla and see what they're doing for the stock price. Let's take it step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol from the tweets. Wait, in the first tweet, the user wrote ""tesla $ tsla $ nflx $ amzn $ goog partylikeits 1999 - - http …"". Hmm, that seems off. Maybe it's a typo or something else. I think I should ignore that and focus on the actual stock symbols if they exist. But in this case, the other tweets have ""tesla"", ""amzn"", ""goog"", etc., so maybe that was a mistake.

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate positive (P) and negative (N) factors. Then assess the sentiment based on how these affect investor confidence. Let me go through them one by one.

Looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER why tesla ' s crazy market valuations are driving us back to cash ! ! ! $ tsla $ nflx $ amzn $ goog partylikeits 1999 - - http …"". It seems like the user is talking about Tesla's valuations, but it's a bit unclear. Maybe it's just an update on valuations or stock prices. The phrase ""crazy market valuations are driving us back to cash"" might be indicating that investors expect more cash flow for Tesla. So perhaps positive sentiment because it's expecting better returns.

The second tweet is similar: ""rt AT_USER why tesla ' s crazy market valuations are driving us back to cash ! ! ! $ tsla $ nflx $ amzn $ goog partylikeits 1999 - - http …"". Same structure, same message. So another positive factor indicating confidence in the stock's value.

Third tweet: ""rt AT_USER why tesla ' s crazy market valuations are driving us back to cash ! ! ! $ tsla $ nflx $ amzn $ goog partylikeits 1999 - - http …"". Again, same message. So it seems like these tweets are reinforcing that investors think Tesla will recover.

Looking at the fourth tweet: "" (1 of 2 ) $ amzn — > 👍 $ cmg — > 👍 $ goog — > 👍 $ fb — > 👍 $ kors — > 👍 $ nflx — > 👍 $ pcln — > 👍 $ regn — > 👍 $ scty — > 👍 madmoneyespresso 2/24 / 14"". This one is more about other companies. It mentions how amzn, goog, fb, etc., are performing and then links to some content or person, ""madmoneyespresso"". That's a known person in the stock market context, so maybe positive because of their influence.

Fifth tweet: ""rt AT_USER why tesla ' s crazy market valuations are driving us back to cash ! ! ! $ tsla $ nflx $ amzn $ goog partylikeits 1999 - - http …"". Similar structure as the first two, reinforcing the idea that Tesla is expected to go back to cash.

Sixth tweet: ""rt AT_USER why tesla ' s crazy market valuations are driving us back to cash ! ! ! $ tsla $ nflx $ amzn $ goog partylikeits 1999 - - http …"". Same as above, reinforcing the same message. So multiple positive factors here.

The seventh tweet is similar: ""rt AT_USER why tesla ' s crazy market valuations are driving us back to cash ! ! ! $ tsla $ nflx $ amzn $ goog partylikeits 1999 - - http …"". Another one reinforcing the same sentiment. So overall, all seven tweets are showing that Tesla is expected to return cash because their valuations are viewed as high.

So putting it together: Each tweet suggests that investors believe Tesla's stock is undervalued and will return cash (i.e., profit) in the future due to strong valuations. This positive outlook on Tesla would boost its overall stock price. There are no negative factors mentioned, so it seems neutral except for the positive sentiment reinforcing this belief.

Therefore, the overall sentiment is Positive."
2014-02-26,Negative,"Alright, so I need to figure out how the given tweets affect the stock price of a company. Let me start by breaking down what each tweet is saying.

The user provided eight tweets, all in Japanese. Looking at them, they seem to be talking about Tesla (TSLA) valuations. The first tweet says that Tesla's valuations are driving everyone back to cash, using terms like ""market valuations,"" ""cash,"" and quotes with dollar signs. The second tweet is a continuation of the first one but uses different stock symbols: TSLA, NFLX, AMZN, GOOGL.

Hmm, the main issue here is that all these tweets are pointing out that Tesla's market value isn't upping; instead, they're talking about returning to cash. That makes me think that investors might be feeling nervous or worried because their money is going back. This could lead some people to sell their Tesla stock, which would reduce demand and possibly lower the price.

Looking at each tweet individually: Each one mentions Tesla's valuations driving them back to cash, which implies a downward trend in the stock price for Tesla. Since it's focusing on cash as an outcome, there's a lack of upward momentum. If people feel that they can't afford to lose money anymore and instead hold onto cash, that could lead to negative sentiment.

Are there any positive aspects here? Maybe some are questioning whether the market is overvalued or if investors are cautious. But the primary issue seems to be about valuations, not a positive trend in the stock itself. The quotes with dollar signs might just be placeholders for actual prices but don't provide clarity on what's happening.

So putting it all together, even though each tweet points towards a downward trend, there's no indication that Tesla is improving or increasing its revenues or something else positive could occur. It seems more about valuations and investor sentiment than any intrinsic value of the stock.

Therefore, considering all these factors, I think the overall impact on the stock price would be negative."
2014-02-27,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of Netflix. I'm not very familiar with stock markets or stock symbols, but I'll do my best.

First, looking at each tweet:

1. The first one says ""netflix drone to home : URL via AT_USER $ nflx taking spoof aimed at $ amzn ..."". Hmm, it mentions NFLX and AMZN, which are known stocks related to Netflix and Amazon. It looks like someone is suggesting a spoof, maybe to bypass some security measures or get an unauthorized access. This could potentially affect the stock prices of both companies if they suspect something unusual about each other. So, this seems like a positive factor because it's bringing attention to their relationship.

2. The second tweet mentions ""amzn youngmoney : subscribe to $ . . . toilet paper ? URL"". It looks like someone is promoting Amazon's newsletter related to toilet paper. Subscribing to newsletters usually means they might support the company and can sometimes lead to increased stock prices because companies are more likely to invest in their products if consumers buy them. So, this could be a positive factor as well.

3. The third tweet says ""$ amzn stock quote , feb 27 : 360.13 +0.33 ( +0.09 % ) ."". It's providing the price of Amazon's stock on February 27th and its movement from a previous date. This is a straightforward financial statement, so it's likely neutral because it's just reporting the current price without any analysis.

4. The fourth tweet starts with ""$ acad bid get started here : also see $ amzn $ ph $ fb $ amzn newsletter URL"". It seems like someone is trying to encourage viewers to sign up for a newsletter related to Amazon, specifically focusing on the Facebook (FB) and YouTube (YouTube) platforms. Promoting products or services through social media can boost stock prices because it generates revenue and brand exposure. So this could be a positive factor.

5. The fifth tweet says ""$ acad bid get started here : also see $ amzn $ ttdz $ gild $ mdrm"". It mentions ""ttdz"" which I'm not familiar with, possibly a typo or incorrect term related to social media platforms like Twitter (Twitter) and Instagram (Instagram). If they're promoting Amazon's services on these platforms, it could lead to increased visibility and potentially higher stock prices. However, since I don't have specific context here, I can't be certain about the sentiment.

Now, let me categorize each tweet:

1. Positive: Drifting towards a possible spoof affecting both Netflix and Amazon.
2. Positive: Promoting a third-party newsletter related to toilet paper support.
3. Neutral: Just providing financial data without analysis.
4. Positive: Encouraging social media promotion for Amazon's services.
5. Neutral: No clear sentiment as it's unclear what ""ttdz"" refers to.

Next, I'll assess the overall sentiment by combining these factors. Two of them are positive (1 and 2), one is neutral (3) with a minor positive factor (4). The last two don't provide much context but could be considered slightly positive if they indicate a direction. So overall, the sentiment seems positive because there's support from multiple angles."
2014-02-28,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets about Amazon's stock price and determine if they are positive, neutral, or negative in terms of their impact on Amazon's future stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. **First Tweet**: It mentions a video about Amazon getting a slice of Apple's music. That seems like a strategic move for Amazon to acquire a competitor without losing customers. So, positive because it's about expanding into another industry and using the revenue from that acquisition to support Amazon. I'll mark this as Positive.

2. **Second Tweet**: The user is talking about speculative investing with big stocks like Facebook, Tesla, NVIDIA, Tesla, and Google. This seems like a trend of investors trying to take advantage of high-value stocks for quick gains. So, the sentiment here is positive because it's about exploiting potential trends. Still Positive.

3. **Third Tweet**: Amazon mentions buying again at a price above $365. That suggests they're scaling up their operations or expanding further. This is a confident approach to support their stock with new revenue, so Positive.

4. **Fourth Tweet**: The sentiment here is about a downgrade from their Emerging Downward Primary Trend (EDPT) rating. A downgrade usually indicates uncertainty or negative expectations. Therefore, this tweet is Negative because it's giving investors a reason to sell before the price recovers.

5. **Fifth Tweet**: They're researching multiple companies and mentioning stock prices like $MDVN, WTM, and AMZN. This seems like they're looking at broader market trends rather than specific company performance. The context here doesn't directly address Amazon's stock performance, so it's Neutral because the tweet is more about general investing strategies.

6. **Sixth Tweet**: Amazon is talking about subscribers increasing by 1278% in their past month and promoting them on various platforms like Amazon, Memrise, YouTube, etc. This is a positive trend for Amazon as more users are seeing value from their services. So, Positive because of the increased reach and user growth.

7. **Seventh Tweet**: The user is checking if it's breakout time with companies like WBC, SLH, NYCB, and AMZN. A breakout in stock price typically indicates a potential upturn where a company could see a significant rise. That's a positive outlook for Amazon, so Positive.

8. **Eighth Tweet**: It seems to be a placeholder or typo with ""stuffit"" and then links to Amazon without a clear action or statement. Since it's unclear what the user is trying to convey about Amazon's stock price, this tweet doesn't provide actionable information. Therefore, it's Neutral because there's no direct impact on the stock.

9. **Ninth Tweet**: Discusses support for their stock based on resistance levels at $530 and EMA 369. This is a technical analysis suggesting that if Amazon's price stays above certain levels, it might rise further. Positive because it's providing a signal to increase position or stay long.

10. **Tenth Tweet**: Recommends investing in Amazon novels for turbo-charging Kindle books. While this could be a way for Amazon to diversify their content market, the primary focus is on stock performance. This doesn't directly address Amazon's stock price but is still an investment strategy that could influence investor sentiment positively.

11. **Eleventh Tweet**: Talks about moving towards researching today's movers in the stock market with companies like JW and UNH. Again, this is speculative investing without a clear indication of Amazon's performance. It's Neutral because it doesn't provide direct information on Amazon's stock price movement.

So, putting all these together: Positive tweets are 1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 10, and 11. The Negative tweet is number 4. There are no clearly positive or negative tweets that directly affect Amazon's stock performance beyond their broader trends and speculative investments.

But wait, the fourth tweet is a downgrade from EDPT, which could have implications for Amazon's fundamentals. If they're being cautious, it might lead to concerns about profitability, but not sure if that affects the stock price directly. The others are more about support or speculation, which can influence the overall sentiment positively because they provide reasons for investors to buy.

So, considering all of these, even though one tweet is Negative, the majority are Positive and Neutral. But looking back at the output requirements, I need a single conclusion based on the given tags: [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Since some tweets indicate uncertainty (negative), but others provide positive information about Amazon's future.

I think it's more nuanced than just a simple Positive or Negative. There are both positive and negative elements. However, if I were to choose, I'd say the overall sentiment is Neutral because while there are some positive tweets pointing in Amazon's direction, the majority of the tweets either provide speculative support or general market trends that don't directly indicate Amazon's stock price movement.

Wait, but looking again, the fourth tweet is a significant downgrade. If they're going to downgraded their EDPT, it might affect investor sentiment. So maybe the overall sentiment isn't Neutral because some negative information is present.

But in the output, I have to choose one tag: [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. The majority of tweets indicate positive actions related to Amazon's stock. But there are also speculative tweets that don't directly impact the stock price but can influence investor decisions. Therefore, perhaps it's a mix, but since all other tweets are either Positive, Neutral, or Unclear (with some being Negative), I think the overall sentiment is leaning towards [Positive] because positive information tends to dominate."
2014-03-01,Missing,File not found
2014-03-02,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out how to determine if the given tweet will impact the stock price positively, neutrally, or negatively. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, I look at the target stock mentioned in the tweet: $ sre insider trading news on $ trza $ trw $ amzn visit URL. Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. The words ""sre,"" ""trza,"" ""trw,"" and ""amzn"" are unfamiliar to me as stock symbols or terms I know. Maybe they're abbreviations or something else entirely.

The tweet mentions insider trading news on those stocks and talks about them visiting a URL. So, the target could be one of these four companies: SRE, TRZA, TRW, or AMZN. But without knowing which specific company it refers to, it's hard to assess their stock performance. SRE is known for being a leading provider of cybersecurity software; TRZA might be related to tech or pharmaceuticals? Wait, I'm not sure about TRWA as well.

Given that the user provided the target stock symbol but didn't identify which one, I need to make an educated guess. Let's consider each possibility:

1. **SRE**: If this is SRE, it could impact the overall market if there are positive or negative news related to cybersecurity. But without context on the sentiment of the tweet about their performance, it's tricky.

2. **TRWA (I think TRW was a biotech stock)**: TRW could be related to pharmaceuticals or biotechnology companies. The mention of insider trading might indicate regulatory concerns or financial rumors, which could affect investor sentiment.

3. **AMZN**: Amazon is a well-known tech company with a lot of publicly traded shares. If there's positive news about their product development or expansion, that could drive stock prices. But if it's negative about their operations, that might go the opposite way.

4. **TRZA**: TRZA isn't something I'm familiar with, but maybe it's a tech company as well. The sentiment could vary widely depending on what they're discussing.

Since the tweet mentions ""visit URL,"" which is vague and not related to specific stock symbols or companies, it's hard to pin down exactly who the target is. That makes me think that this tweet might be more about general trends or market events rather than a specific company.

Assuming all else equal, if there are no specific stocks mentioned in detail, I should assess based on potential general factors affecting the overall stock market. The tweet is about insider trading news on multiple companies, which could indicate increased risks with their operations and regulatory scrutiny. That might lead to negative sentiment towards certain sectors or even the company itself.

However, without knowing if these stocks are leading or lagging, I can't say for sure. But given that it's a general statement without specifics about particular stocks, it's probably not predicting any significant performance but rather potential risks and information asymmetry.

So, considering all this uncertainty, I think the overall sentiment is likely Negative because there's no specific direction given in the tweet regarding any particular stock or market trend."
2014-03-03,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on Amazon's stock price. I'm not an expert, but I'll take it step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock. Looking at the tweets, they mention ""symc"" and ""amzn,"" so that must be Symcet and Amazon. So, the stock we're focusing on is Amazon.

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. Let me look at the first tweet: ""if $ am zn rallies up to the 380 level i'll take a short . good level , good risk to reward . targeting 320 ."" Hmm, this looks like it's predicting a rally towards 380 with a target of 320. It's talking about technical analysis and is advising taking a short position if it goes that high. So the positive factors here are the investor's confidence in the stock and the potential reward.

The second tweet: ""get stock market reports on $ symc $ pl $ expe $ amzn investing URL"" This seems like it's providing information about future investments, so it's a bit of an opinionative message. It might be more about encouraging investors to do something else or perhaps discussing upcoming investments related to both Symc and Amazon.

Now, assessing sentiment for each tweet: The first one is definitely positive because it's talking about the stock going up and advising on taking a short position. That sounds like strong confidence. The second tweet is more informational, so I'm not sure if that contributes to sentiment in that specific direction. Maybe it's just urging others to invest or discuss future trends.

Combining these, the first tweet is clearly positive because it's a proactive action the investor is taking. The second tweet might be less about the stock itself and more about encouraging investment-related discussions, which could influence market sentiment indirectly but not as strongly.

So overall, I think the sentiment is leaning towards [Positive] from the first tweet, but the second tweet isn't providing significant evidence for or against Amazon's stock price change. Therefore, the most impactful factor is positive."
2014-03-04,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about the stock price impact on the given company. The user provided four tweets and asked to determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative for a stock.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""stock watchlist . find out why $ ilmn $ mdt $ exr $ amzn $ amzn must see URL"" Hmm, it mentions $ amzn but then doesn't specify the company's name. Maybe that's a typo or maybe it's referring to a specific stock like Apple? I should look for other tweets to get more information.

Next tweet: ""rt AT_USER is roku david or goliath against apple & amazon ? URL $ aapl $ amzn $ goog $ ntgr roku AT_USER"". The username is AT_USER and the words mention ""robo"" which could refer to RoBooteq. This seems to be about the performance of companies named Apgon, Apple, Google, and NTT Corporation.

Third tweet: Similar to the second one, it's also about a pgon company. It mentions ""robo"" again. So another company by the same name as Apgon.

Fourth tweet: The text is a bit ambiguous. It has words like ""innovative,"" ""flexible solutions,"" and mentions Apple and Amazon. It seems to be discussing new technology companies that might perform well in tech sectors.

Now, I need to analyze each tweet based on positive or negative factors. For each tweet, separate the factors into positive (good) and negative (bad) aspects. Then assess the sentiment based on these factors.

First tweet: ""find out why $ ilmn $ mdt $ exr $ amzn $ amzn must see URL"". It mentions Amzn but not a specific company. Maybe it's a typo for Apple? I'm not sure about that, so I can't be certain of the factors here.

Second and third tweets are similar: they mention ""robo"" or Apgon, which could mean something like RoBooteq. Since there's no explicit information about positive or negative aspects, it's hard to assess sentiment.

Fourth tweet is talking about new tech companies that might improve performance in tech sectors. It doesn't specify if these companies are good or bad, but since the context seems positive and aligning with tech trends, I can lean towards a positive overall sentiment for this one.

Putting it all together: The first tweet has uncertainty, which makes it hard to decide. The next two tweets are about specific companies that might perform well due to new technologies. The fourth tweet is also leaning positive. However, without clear information on whether these companies are good or bad, I can't definitively say one way or the other.

But since there are four tweets and three options, maybe the overall sentiment leans more towards positive because at least two of them are discussing potential growth in tech stocks, which often perform well. The third tweet could also be seen as a sign of optimism about new businesses, contributing to a positive overall outlook."
2014-03-05,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. 

Starting with the first tweet: ""$ amzn zacks industry outlook highlights : macy's , amazon , apple , google and facebook URL"". So, this one mentions several companies but focuses specifically on the Amazon stock symbol ""amzn"" and talks about an industry outlook highlight from Zacks. This is positive because it's giving readers a reason to look into Amazon, which can influence investor sentiment positively.

The second tweet: ""$ amzn quill & quire selects finalists for amazon.ca first novel award URL"". This one mentions the Amazon stock symbol again but focuses on Quill & Quire selecting finalists for an award. While this could be seen as positive, it's more about the organization of a competition rather than directly influencing Amazon. The tone here is neutral because it's discussing a specific event that might not have a significant direct impact on Amazon's performance.

The third tweet: ""$ amzn quill & quire selects finalists for amazon.ca first novel award URL"". Similar to the second one, this again talks about Quill & Quire and an award, which seems positive. However, it doesn't mention any specific information related to Amazon's stock price or market movement, so I'm not sure if there's a strong impact here.

Putting it all together: The first tweet is definitely positive because it provides context on Amazon and can motivate investor interest. The other two tweets are neutral as they focus on unrelated events without directly impacting the stock price. So overall, the sentiment seems mixed, but leaning more towards positive since at least one tweet adds value to the discussion."
2014-03-06,Negative,"Okay, so I need to determine whether each tweet is positive, neutral, or negative in terms of impact on the stock price of Amazon (AMZN). Let's take it step by step.

First, for each tweet, I have to extract the target stock symbol. The user provided several tweets, and from their descriptions, I can identify that the target stock seems to be AMZN since all the mentions are related to Amazon or its stock.

Now, let's go through each tweet one by one and analyze them.

1. ""rt AT_USER want to find more time to read books ? try this : URL $ amzn""
   - The user is talking about finding more time for reading and suggesting a link to AMZN. There's no mention of stock performance here, just personal advice or updating their URL. So, it doesn't seem like a direct impact on the stock price.

2. ""i am getting handled today half of gains from $ bac depleted currently in $ amzn calls trying go green or less red lol""
   - This tweet seems to be addressing technical issues with AMZN's stock price and suggesting strategies to stay neutral or avoid gains. It's more about analysis rather than advice, so the sentiment here is neutral.

3. ""staples to shut as many as 225 stores , cut costs by $ 500 million URL via AT_USER $ spls $ cost $ amzn""
   - The user is discussing actions related to reducing costs and closing 225 stores, which could affect AMZN's financial performance. This sounds like a positive factor because it might help the company manage expenses and improve visibility. So, this tweet has a positive impact.

4. ""shoud you sell $ amzn $ man $ urs $ aapl goto URL""
   - Again, similar to the previous one, the user is issuing advice or suggesting a move. It's not about actual selling but rather advising actions related to AMZN and its competitors. The language here is more like an opinion piece than advice, so it seems neutral.

5. ""$ amzn covered 367.5 p at . 55 and entered yoku 35p at . 88""
   - This tweet refers to the price movement of AMZN. It mentions that the stock was ""covered"" (which might mean it's being sold off due to buying interest) at $367.50 and then it went down to $35 per share. The overall trend is a decrease, which indicates negative sentiment.

Now, let me summarize each tweet:

1. No direct impact; personal advice.
2. Neutral opinion about stock price analysis.
3. Positive action suggesting cost cuts.
4. Advice without actual selling.
5. Price movement downwards indicating possible negative impact.

So, the overall sentiment is a mix of positive actions and negative price movements. However, since each tweet isn't directly related to the stock, it's hard to combine them into a single conclusion. But considering all factors together, there might be some overall negative impact due to reduced price but also potential growth from cost savings.

Wait, but in the output requirements, I need to conclude with one of the three tags. Since each tweet isn't directly about AMZN's stock performance, combining their effects is tricky. Maybe it's a mix of positive and negative sentiments? But the user said to conclude with just one tag. So perhaps considering all the factors together, the overall sentiment might be considered Negative because while there are selling actions, the price movement down suggests downward pressure.

Alternatively, maybe the selling actions (tweets 4) could indicate a desire to reduce costs, which is a positive factor, but the low stock price at the end (tweet 5) shows a downward trend. So it's a mix—some positive factors and some negative. But I'm not sure if that leads to a single tag.

I think the best approach is to conclude with Negative because there are selling actions that could be seen as reducing costs, but the overall price movement down suggests downward pressure without specific information on the technical side. However, since all tweets aren't directly about AMZN's stock performance, it's challenging to make a clear conclusion."
2014-03-07,Negative,"Okay, so I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the future stock price of AmZN. Let me break down each tweet and see what they're suggesting.

The first tweet is about investing in $ all $ har $ kmx $ amzn worth a look URL. Hmm, that seems a bit off. The terms like ""all"" and ""har"" don't seem familiar to me, maybe it's a typo or something else entirely. I'll leave this one as neutral because the information isn't clear enough.

The second tweet mentions earnings news on $ pl $ exr $ tdg $ amzn view now URL. Again, some of these symbols are new to me and not meaningful context. I can't tell much from here; it seems like just a piece of information that doesn't add much to my understanding. So, this tweet is probably neutral.

Now the third tweet has ""→ all parabolic charts collapse → $ aapl aapl $ gps $ tsla $ amzn amzn $ nflx nflx $ pcln pcln"". Parabolic charts collapsing? I'm not sure what that means. Maybe it's related to stock prices, but without more context, it's hard to interpret. It looks like the company names are being listed and collapsed, which could imply something about their future performance or potential issues. But since it's unclear, this tweet is probably neutral.

The fourth tweet says ""rt AT_USER learning from AT_USER ceo jeff bezos : the man who can sell anything URL $ amzn"". This one has some interesting elements. At user is referring to a person, Jeff Bezos, and he's talking about him learning from another CEO. I know that Jeff Bezos is involved in Amazon (AMZN). This could suggest that AMZN's leadership might change or evolve, which might affect investor sentiment. It also mentions ""the man who can sell anything,"" which sounds like a positive outlook or potential for growth. So this tweet seems to be pointing towards a positive impact on the stock price.

Putting it all together: The third tweet is ambiguous but doesn't seem impactful, the fourth one has potential to influence investors positively. The first two are too vague or unclear. So overall, I think there's some positive sentiment from that fourth tweet."
2014-03-08,Neutral,"Okay, I need to figure out how the given tweets affect the stock price of Amazon (AMZN). Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at each tweet individually and determine what they're saying. The target stock is AMZN, so I need to see if these tweets are affecting its performance.

1. ""keeping my eye on $ bdn $ ori $ ca $ amzn overvalued URL"" - Hmm, this one doesn't seem relevant to AMZN. It's talking about some other stocks and a URL, which probably isn't related to Amazon. So I think this tweet is neutral because it's not impacting the target company.

2. ""AMZN just had its first-quarter earnings report. The board made a surprise announcement of revenue growth exceeding expectations. The management team, led by CEO Jeff Bezos, has been optimistic about AMZN’s future potential."" This one is definitely positive. It mentions that AMZN reported higher-than-expected earnings and mentioned the CEO's optimism. That suggests investors are seeing good news, which would make this tweet a positive indicator.

3. ""Amazon (AMZN) is the most talked about stock on Wall Street. The company continues to be a key player in the tech sector. This week, several big tech companies have announced significant upgrades on their AMZN shares."" Again, this is focused on AMZN and talks about its importance in the tech sector. It's also predicting growth because of upcoming upgrades. That looks positive for Amazon stock.

So, putting it all together: Two neutral tweets and one positive tweet. The two neutral tweets don't affect AMZN directly, while the positive tweet shows improvement which is good news."
2014-03-09,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by breaking down each tweet one by one.

First tweet: ""Amazon $ amzn best bargain * * * URL shopping."" It seems like Amazon is mentioned with a word cloud and they're talking about a 'best bargain' deal, which could mean a good buy. I'm not sure if that's positive or neutral because it depends on what the user actually sees.

Second tweet: ""$ px stock watchlist . find out why $ abbv $ wab $ amzn economy URL."" It mentions some company names and economic terms. This could affect investor sentiment, but without more info, I can't tell if it's positive, negative, or neutral. The mention of the economy is broad, so maybe a slight impact.

Third tweet: ""$ todays stocks to watch $ aig $ stj $ cab $ amzn must have URL."" Similar structure here; mentions various companies and ""must have"" which might indicate importance but not sure about the sentiment.

Fourth tweet: ""After 2,600 % gains , a new penny stock alert's coming and you can get it first ! major news : $ amzn $ mcox $ goog."" This looks like news about Amazon's performance with a big gain percentage. It suggests the company is doing well and there might be an upcoming update or alert, which could be positive because it shows potential growth.

Fifth tweet: ""$ its breaktout time on $ slab $ ahl $ aiv $ amzn stock URL."" This seems like news about a break-out event for Amazon's stock. Breakout events can indicate strong momentum and possibly rising stock price, so this might contribute positively.

Sixth tweet: ""$ get great research on stocks $ cli $ nu $ life $ amzn wealthmanagement URL."" Again, mentions financial topics. Wealth management is a broad field, but it could influence investor sentiment positively if they think the company's services are good for their wealth goals.

Now, considering all these tweets, they're all talking about Amazon doing well or having upcoming events related to it. The positive ones like 4 and 5 suggest strong news, so overall sentiment is probably positive."
2014-03-10,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets regarding their impact on Amazon's stock price. I'm not very familiar with financial markets or predicting stock prices based on tweets alone, but I'll take it step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""$ nsc todays movers to research $ infa $ oi $ amzn view now URL"". Hmm, that seems a bit confusing because ""nsc"" doesn't ring any bells. Maybe it's a typo or some placeholder. I'll assume the main stock mentioned is Amazon (AMZN), as that's a common one in these types of tweets.

The second tweet: ""is it breakout time on $ am $ adt $ amzn $ gain moneymanagement URL"". The words here include AMZN and money management, which sounds like a strategy related to trading or investing. The mention of ""breakout time"" suggests potential market movement, but I'm not sure if that's positive or negative.

The third tweet: ""AT_USER lol $ plug is next ... that was $ 1 2 months ago now its almost $ 10 ! ! ! im just here selling spreads on $ aapl , $ amzn , $ tsla"". This one seems more technical. It mentions a user's comment about an upcoming feature or update (plug is next) and talks about the price dropping from $1 to nearly $10, which might indicate some concern or fear of the stock. The mention of spreads on Apple (APL), Amazon, and Tesla suggests a focus on tech stocks, but I'm not certain if that's positive or negative.

The fourth tweet: ""$ amzn the bears are all dead ( and the best iPad app for traders and investor ... URL"". This seems to be promoting Amazon as the ""best"" product in their list. The mention of an iPad app suggests they're focusing on tech products, but again, without more context, it's hard to tell if this is positive or negative.

Now, breaking down each tweet into factors:

1. For tweet 1: It mentions researching future movements, which could indicate anticipation about the stock's potential performance.
2. Tweet 2: Relates to a possible breakout in trading and mentions money management, which could be either a positive signal for risk management or a warning about market uncertainty.
3. Tweet 3: Talks about an upcoming feature and price drops, which might suggest concern about trends or technical issues, potentially negative.
4. Tweet 4: Promotes Amazon as the best product in their list, which is more about brand positioning rather than stock performance.

Assessing sentiment:

- Tweet 1: Anticipating a move could be positive if someone is confident, but it's speculative without more info.
- Tweet 2: The mention of money management and potential breakout suggests risk management practices, so positive for investor confidence.
- Tweet 3: Price drops and an upcoming feature might indicate uncertainty or fear, which is negative.
- Tweet 4: Promoting the product could be neutral if it's just a recommendation without specific information about performance.

Combining these, tweets 2 and 4 seem to have some positive elements (money management in tweet 2 and brand promotion in tweet 4), while tweets 1 and 3 are more speculative or negative. However, considering all factors together, the overall sentiment might lean towards [Neutral] because there's a mix of positive and negative aspects without clear dominant trends."
2014-03-11,Neutral,"Alright, I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets regarding Amazon's stock price. Let me start by going through each tweet one by one.

The first tweet is ""are you selling $ apol $ enh $ erie $ amzn investing URL."" It seems like someone is mentioning their investments in Amazon but doesn't specify if they're buying or selling, just a bit confused with some misspellings. I don't have enough information here to determine sentiment yet.

The second tweet: ""$ amzn esperando 383 URL."" The word ""esperando"" means looking forward, which might indicate that the user is planning to wait for something, possibly expecting better performance or positive news. This could be a bit vague though.

Third tweet: ""rt AT_USER notice the date - profit from $ jcp URL $ wmt $ amzn $ tgt $ m $ kss $ shld AT_USER."" The word ""profit"" here suggests that AT_USER is seeing gains, which might indicate some positive action or information. But without knowing who's contributing to this tweet, it's hard to tell if it's boosting the stock.

Fourth tweet: ""AT_USER rt today 03-11- 14 $ aapl algo triggered sell @ 09:56 fv 330 , p / t 528 stocks nexttrade $ pcln $ nflx $ tsla $ twtr $ fb $ goog $ amzn $ qqq."" This one is quite detailed. It mentions that an algorithm on Astra Precision (Aply) triggered a sell order at 9:56, targeting 330 stocks for the next trade. A sudden action like selling could be seen as negative because it might reduce investor confidence or increase risk.

Fifth tweet: ""are you regretting your investment in $ wr $ laz $ afl $ amzn view now URL."" Similar to the first tweet, this seems confused but likely indicates someone is reviewing their investments, possibly regretting them. This vague language could be neutral since it doesn't specify a clear positive or negative action.

Sixth tweet: ""$ amzn best buys turnaround is on track despite weak sales URL."" Here, it mentions Amazon's best buy opportunities are on track, even though sales have been weak. A positive outlook on potential future gains can boost the stock price, so this seems like a strong indicator of positivity.

Seventh tweet: ""rt AT_USER productivity : union railroad vs . tech juggernauts URL $ unp $ ups $ brk . b $ goog $ amzn."" This is more of a comparison between productivity and other companies. It's speculative without knowing the specific context or company mentioned, so it's hard to assess sentiment here.

Now, compiling all this information: Tweets 2 and 6 have vague signals about expecting better performance or positive outlooks. Tweet 4 shows that there was an action taken but could be seen as negative. The others are more uncertain. Overall, while some tweets suggest potential improvements or actions, they don't provide enough clarity to definitively say the stock is going up, down, or neutral."
2014-03-12,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, the target stock is AMZN, which is Amazon. 

Looking at the first tweet: ""Amazon said to be adding a music-streaming service URL."" That sounds like they're expanding their offerings into another area beyond just their core business. This could mean they might diversify or expand into new markets. I'm not sure if this directly affects AMZN's performance, but it's something to consider.

Second tweet: ""Goldman Sachs acknowledges Bitcoin’s potential $ GS $ AMZN $ WMT URL through AT_USER."" Hmm, I'm not familiar with AT_USER as a username or context here. It mentions Bitcoin and how GS, AMZN, and WMT are related. Not entirely clear on what this means for Amazon's stock. Maybe it's about market sentiment around Bitcoin, which is often tied to AMZN?

Third tweet: ""AT_USER rt us markets are clearly in bubble state $ TSLA $ AMZN $ PCLN $ BDNK $ FLUX $ TWTR $ FB $ GOOG $ LNK $ APEL $ QQQ."" This looks like Amazon (TSLA), Tesla, Protoncore, BDNk, FLUX, Twtr, Facebook, Google, Lnk, and QQQ. They're mentioning a bubble state for multiple companies. If the markets are in a bubble, that could indicate fear among investors, which might lead to negative sentiment.

Fourth tweet: ""AT_USER rt $ TSLA hft algos triggered sell @ 14:26 fv 232 , p / t 227 stocks next trade $ PCLN $ BDNK $ FLUX $ TWTR $ FB $ GOOG $ AMZN $ APEL $ QQQ."" This seems to be a tweet from AT_USER where they're selling positions. They mention hft and algos, which are trading strategies. If they're triggering a sell order, it could indicate that Amazon is selling off its shares. But I'm not sure how significant this impact is on their overall stock price.

Fifth tweet: ""Today's stocks to watch $ NTRS $ NSC $ DRQ $ AMZN newsletter URL."" They mention a newsletter from NTRS and NSC, but I don't know what these companies are related to. The focus seems more on Amazon's newsletter. Not sure how this affects AMZN.

Sixth tweet: ""Robotics ETF tops $ 100 million in assets URL ETF Technology $ ROBO $ GOOG $ APEL $ AMZN."" This is about a robotics ETF, which might be a subset of AMZN stocks or another company. It mentions tech-related companies like Google and APEL. If they're a large ETF with significant assets under management, it could indicate good investor sentiment.

Seventh tweet: ""$ DLR Stocks to hold onto $ CBT $ BUK $ AMZN moneymanagement URL."" They talk about DLR stocks and mention moneymanagement. This sounds like they're looking to invest in AMZN's money management services. If the company is a major player in that space, this could have positive implications for AMZN.

Putting it all together: The third tweet mentions a market bubble, which can be bad news if investors are scared of a crash. The seventh tweet suggests holding onto AMZN for their money management service, which might support the stock price. But there's no information on how significant each tweet is or whether they're positive or negative. So overall, it seems like some tweets have mixed sentiment."
2014-03-13,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out the overall sentiment for these tweets about Amazon's stock price. So, I'm supposed to analyze each tweet and see how they affect investor sentiment.

First, looking at the first few tweets, they all talk about price increases or adjustments. For example, the first one confirms a $99 pricing on Amazon. These seem pretty straightforward and don't indicate negative or positive signals yet.

Then, I see some tweets with ""prime fee hike."" These are definitely bad news because higher prices can hurt the company's margins, especially if they're for consumers who might not need them. So, these would likely be seen as negative.

I also notice a few tweets that mention ' bethehouse .' There was one where Amazon is being criticized for losing jobs and had a \$3 billion financial impact. This is huge because job losses can really hurt a company's reputation and investor confidence.

Other tweets are just repeating the same price change, which doesn't add much new information. Some mention competitors like Netflix or want-be-entrepreneur but that seems more about the content rather than the stock price itself.

So putting it all together: The negative tweets include the prime fee hikes, job losses, and the competitor news. These factors are significant enough to make me think that Amazon's stock might be performing poorly. Therefore, I'll go with a Negative overall sentiment."
2014-03-14,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the overall impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price based on the given instructions. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the task is to analyze each tweet individually and determine if it contributes to a positive, neutral, or negative sentiment towards Amazon (AMZN). Then, combine all the factors to decide the overall sentiment.

Looking at the tweets from 1 to 32, I notice that most of them talk about AMZN's stock performance. For example, some mention a trade increase by 620%, which might indicate growth or positive news. Others discuss earnings and price movements. However, there are also a few that ask questions, like ""get stock market reports on..."" which might not directly contribute to sentiment but could be part of the overall analysis.

I should separate each tweet into factors: Positive and Negative. From the first five tweets (1-5), they all talk about AMZN's trade increase by 620%, their financial performance, and a mention of a prime membership fee hike. These are all positive indicators for Amazon's stock price.

From 6 onwards, the tweets mostly ask questions or provide additional info like ""get more winners..."" which seems neutral as it might just direct someone to get more information. The ones from 1-5 seem to be reinforcing AMZN's performance, so their collective impact is likely positive.

The remaining tweets (7-32) are similar to the first five. They talk about price increases, earnings reports, and sometimes questions that don't add much to sentiment but might just be promotional.

Now, looking at all these tweets: they're all positive in nature regarding AMZN's performance. There's no mention of any negative news or warnings about risks, technical issues, or any other factors that would suggest the stock could drop. Instead, they're all focused on reinforcing the current situation and possibly future expectations.

Considering this, I don't see any negative cues here. All the tweets are supportive of AMZN's positive aspects. So, combining everything, the overall sentiment is definitely positive."
2014-03-15,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative in terms of their impact on a company's stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER our 5 ' free samples ' of 2/10 turned $1,280 into $14,811 in 30 days : $abx$ amzn$ ci$ ibm$ isrg$ slw$ sso - get more @ ht …"" Hmm, this looks like it's promoting Amazon (AMZN). The tweet mentions free samples turning a number into something huge. That seems like a strong selling point for Amazon. The use of ""free samples"" and the potential for big returns suggests positive growth.

Next, I'll check if there are any negative factors in these tweets. None seem to stand out here. All the other tweets mention the same positive aspect but repeat similar phrases, so no negative aspects are present except maybe the customer complaint about a URL going down. But that's probably more of a minor issue and unlikely to affect the overall sentiment positively.

The user ID ""at_user"" is repeated across multiple tweets, which is typical in social media or Twitter trends. The fact that it's all promoting Amazon aligns with a positive market sentiment. Also, the use of $ signs for products like free samples and stock ticker symbols can be seen as a marketing tactic to attract investors.

The second tweet seems to repeat similar content without adding anything new, so no substantial changes here.

Looking at the third one: it's another repetition of the same message from previous tweets. So again, reinforcing the positive aspects without introducing any negatives.

For trades making AMZN go from 80% to 100% daily free webinars—this might indicate a strategic move by Amazon to attract more customers or increase their product offerings, which could be seen as a competitive advantage, thus contributing positively.

The fourth tweet is about a webinar URL related to AMZN for free samples. This seems to target the audience and promote the service they're offering, which can boost demand and stock price.

However, looking at the fifth tweet: ""AT_USER the amazonwhisperer : URL AT_USER $ amzn customerco customerhacker <- you're going to like this jp!"" The mention of a customer complaint about the URL going down could be a red flag. It might affect user trust but in this context, since it's unrelated to the positive tweet about AMZN samples and webinars, it doesn't directly impact the stock price positively.

The sixth tweet is another repetition of the same promotion as before, further reinforcing the positive message without any negative content.

So putting it all together: All tweets are promoting Amazon through free samples and webinars. The positive messages align with a general bullish market trend, so despite some minor issues like a URL complaint, the overall sentiment seems positive.

Therefore, I conclude that this would be a [Positive] sentiment."
2014-03-16,Negative,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a series of tweets and wants me to determine their likely impact on a stock's future price using only ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"" as possible responses.

First, I'll need to identify the target stock from the tweets. However, looking through the tweets, none seem to mention any specific stock symbol or identifier. That might make it hard to pinpoint which company is being referred to. If the user can provide more context about the stock in question, that would be ideal for analysis.

Next, I'll look at each tweet one by one. Each tweet talks about free samples and how they turned $1,280 into $14,811 over 30 days, with various companies mentioned like AMZN (Amazon), ABX, IBM, Isrg, SSO, etc. Some tweets repeat the same content, which might indicate a consistent trend.

I notice that multiple tweets are very similar in their content and structure—each seems to outline how free samples could boost a stock's value. This repetition suggests that each tweet is reinforcing the idea of positive potential for the stock.

Considering the nature of financial information, tweets like these are often used by investors for research or market analysis. They usually convey optimistic expectations about future trends. 

The user might be an investor looking to gauge the outlook on a particular company based on social media sentiment. The consistent use of words like ""free samples,"" ""future gains,"" and the positive results in 30 days indicate a positive outlook.

Without specific stock information, it's challenging to assess how significant or certain this impact is, but given the trends, it seems favorable for the stock price. However, without concrete data on the company's financial health, performance metrics, or competitive position, I can't be certain about the strength of the positive sentiment.

In conclusion, while each tweet suggests potential benefits for the stock, there's a lack of specific information to determine if this is a significant factor in the future price. The overall sentiment seems leaning towards a positive, but it could vary based on additional factors not provided."
2014-03-17,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price and determine whether it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at each tweet individually:

1. The first tweet mentions that Amazon's S&P 500 index is revised down by 85%. That sounds like a significant change in the overall market. I'm not sure how much of this impacts Amazon's stock directly unless it affects its revenue or profit, but since they're updating their earnings, that might be considered positive news for Amazon.

2. The second tweet talks about Amazon Prime's fee hike. Hikes usually affect prices and margins, which can influence demand. It mentions stimulating growth, so that seems like a positive sign because higher fees could encourage more customers or better pricing strategies. This would likely boost Amazon's stock.

3. The third tweet is questioning if the prime price hike would result in $20 per year for AMZN. This seems like a hypothetical and speculative news, which isn't directly related to their current performance but might affect investor sentiment without a clear impact on stock price movements. So this could be neutral or even negative if the implication is that Amazon might be struggling.

4. The fourth tweet suggests retailers are still catching up when it comes to giving shoppers what they want. If there's pressure on prices, it can make consumers feel constrained, which might reduce demand and thus decrease sales. This could be a negative impact because decreased sales would lower the stock price.

5. The fifth tweet mentions Apple introducing itunes radio plans to increase by $20 against Pandora media. If Apple is taking more money away from its competitors without compensation, that could harm Amazon's stock. It seems like Amazon might lose market share or reduce profit margins, affecting their performance.

6. The sixth tweet discusses AMZN facing a netflix price hike while facing a netflix pain. Netflix is already a big player in the streaming industry, so if they're struggling with them, it could impact revenue and stock. It's not clear how this affects Amazon specifically but might indicate a competitive environment that could negatively affect Amazon.

7. The seventh tweet is about AMZN planning an IPO for Alibaba, which would be massive. An IPO is a huge deal; it would increase investor interest and potentially boost the stock price if they're attracted to the funds. However, this seems like a very significant event with potential for both positive and negative impacts depending on the timing.

Now, combining all these thoughts: The first tweet is a big market-wide downmove which could be a concern but doesn't directly indicate Amazon's performance. The second tweet suggests increased growth and possibly pricing, so that’s positive. The third tweet has a speculative angle; if it leads to significant changes in AMZN's valuation, that would be negative. The fourth tweet points towards lower demand due to constrained shoppers, which is bad. The fifth and sixth tweets suggest Amazon losing parts of its revenue or competitors struggling, both negatives. The seventh tweet could have either positive (more funds) or negative (high pressure for AMZN) impacts depending on the timing.

Overall, most of these seem to have mixed signals. Some tweets indicate positive trends (AMZN's fee increases and potential IPO), while others suggest negative impacts (competitive pressures and revenue dilution). The magnitude isn't clear, but given that one tweet is a huge market move, it might weigh significantly on Amazon's sentiment. I think the overall sentiment could be a mix of positive and negative factors."
2014-03-18,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. 

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. All the tweets mention ""amzn,"" so that's clear. So the stock is Amazon. Now, for each tweet, I have to separate positive and negative factors.

Looking at tweet 1: The user says there's a buying opportunity based on open interest and raises the price target to $455. This sounds like a positive factor because it suggests investors are getting more optimistic about Amazon, which could go up.

Tweet 2 mentions ""URL investors"" but doesn't specify whether it's a good or bad thing. It could be positive if it leads to growth or negative otherwise.

Tweets 3 and 4 talk about the stock performing on different platforms like Yelp and Yodd. It seems neutral because they're just evaluating performance rather than giving a clear up or down signal.

Tweet 5 is talking about the market's performance with various stocks, which could be positive if it's expecting higher returns.

Tweets 6 to 10 are all about stock options and other factors. Some mention specific calls, others just give stock ticker symbols.

Now, assessing sentiment for each tweet: 

- Tweets 1 and 5 are definitely positive because they talk about buying opportunities and expected growth.
- Ties 2 and 7 seem neutral because they're general assessments without clear up or down cues.
- Tweets 3 to 6 don't mention sentiment; they just evaluate performance on platforms, which is neutral.
- Tweets 8 and 9 are a bit ambiguous but could be positive given Jeff bezos's strategies. Also, some mention other factors like the CBOE index, which might indicate expected future movements.

Putting it all together: The most important tweets are 1 and 5, both strongly positive. Even though tweet 2 is neutral on URLs, overall sentiment leans towards positive because of those two clear signals."
2014-03-19,Neutral,"Okay, I'm looking at these tweets about Amazon and other stocks. The first tweet says there's a price hike from AT_USER. That doesn't seem to be related to Amazon itself. Maybe it's just some kind of link or typo.

The second tweet mentions subscribers seeing gains on penny stocks like PennyStocks. Penny stocks have low stock prices, so higher gains mean they're doing well. But this is about how subscribers are doing, not specifically Amazon. It might suggest a positive trend for those penny stocks but not sure about Amazon as a company.

The third tweet talks about watching the weekly stocks and suggesting URLs. Again, not directly related to Amazon unless it's a link to some stock or index. I don't see any information connecting these tweets to Amazon's actual performance affecting its stock price.

Overall, none of the tweets seem to be discussing Amazon's stock. They're more about trends on penny stocks or other unrelated topics. So there's no clear impact on Amazon's future stock price."
2014-03-20,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by going through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet says $ Amzn is still hovering around 341.92 and won't breach that number. They expect it to get into the 400s again. So, the user thinks the stock might continue its upward trend but doesn't see a strong push downward. That seems positive for Amazon.

2. The second tweet mentions various companies with their symbols listed. It doesn't seem like there's anything negative here; it just talks about growth and specific company names. This is more about the market rather than the stock itself, so probably neutral.

3. The third tweet includes multiple symbols and mentions news on volume for several stocks. Again, without any negative keywords or negative sentiment, this seems to be a mix of positive and neutral aspects.

4. The fourth tweet refers to an article by a Zacks analyst blog discussing Google. It mentions buying from Google, which could imply increased interest in Amazon's stock because it's linked to Google. This might be seen as a bit of a sales push but doesn't necessarily mean the stock will decrease.

5. The fifth tweet indicates that Amzn isn't trading right now and talks about potential moves similar to YTD or past days. It suggests the stock could trend downward, which is a negative outlook for Amazon.

So putting it all together: the first tweet suggests a positive outlook, the second is neutral, third is also neutral, the fourth has some positive info but doesn't push down the stock much, and the fifth tweet predicts a negative move. However, these are mostly positive in nature—some just outlooks. So overall sentiment seems positive."
2014-03-21,Negative,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on Amazon's stock price. The user provided two tweets and asked me to determine if each is positive, neutral, or negative towards Amazon.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet: ""$ amzn mystery company building giant complex in san jose URL"". Hmm, that doesn't seem like a specific stock symbol. Maybe it's trying to link a company name with a stock? Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo or placeholder for a specific stock.

Wait, actually, looking closer, it says ""mystery company building a giant complex in San Jose."" That sounds like a tech company involved in construction projects, possibly related to AI or cybersecurity. Maybe it's referring to a startup or a specific sector. But since the user didn't provide the actual stock symbol, I can't proceed on that front.

The second tweet is ""$ cci $ lh $ oxy $ amzn click URL"". Again, this seems like several stocks being watched: CCI, LH, OXY, and AMZN. It's unclear if these are specific companies or just a list of stocks the user is monitoring for.

Without knowing the actual stock symbols or context, I can't really assess the sentiment impact on Amazon's stock price. The tweets are more about identifying potential companies related to Amazon rather than directly commenting on the company itself. Therefore, it's challenging to determine if these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative regarding Amazon's performance.

I think the best I can do is note that these tweets might be trying to guide investors in monitoring specific sectors or companies but without concrete information about their impact, I can't make an accurate assessment."
2014-03-22,Neutral,"Okay, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on a stock. The tweet provided is about holding onto $ in some stocks and suggesting an URL. Hmm, it seems a bit unclear because I don't have any specific company names mentioned here. 

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. But without knowing which company we're talking about, this could be tricky. Maybe the tweet is referring to a general topic or industry, but that's vague. Without more context on what the stocks are or the company in question, it's hard to determine their actual performance.

Even if I had the stock symbol, analyzing each tweet individually would require knowing which tweets are relevant and how they relate to the target stock. Since these tweets seem generic without any specific mention of a particular company, I can't accurately assess their impact on the stock price. It might be that the user is trying to collect information or test an analysis tool but hasn't provided enough details.

Without clear factors or sentiment from the tweet, it's impossible to make a judgment on whether the tweet will affect the stock positively, neutrally, or negatively. The overall sentiment summary can only be determined if each tweet provides specific insights about investor sentiment towards the target company.

I think the best approach here is to inform the user that without knowing which specific stock they're looking at and having the context from previous tweets, it's impossible to determine the impact on its future stock price. I should also ask them to provide more details or specify the target company so I can give a more accurate analysis."
2014-03-23,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on Amazon's stock price. First, I'll start by identifying the target stock from the tweets.

Looking at the first tweet: ""if ' $ amzn fails at 363.9 then 358.4 and 349.5 will be my lower targets . major support at 337.73 . $ tf_f $ es_f $ nq_f $ ym_f $ qqq $ spy $ iwm"". It mentions ""amzn"" which is the ticker symbol for Amazon. So, I'll focus on Amazon's tweets.

Next, I need to separate each tweet into positive and negative factors. But wait, all the tweets seem to be about support or news related to Amazon, not specific factors like earnings reports or company-specific events. Some mention trading targets, others discuss streaming news and other companies. 

Then, I'll assess the sentiment of each tweet towards Amazon. The first one talks about potential target prices if something happens, suggesting concern but with a positive outlook. The second mentions streaming news, which could be negative for Amazon's stock. The third includes a mix of good and bad information, but without specifics on Amazon's performance.

I should consider the overall sentiment by weighing these factors. While some tweets are positive, others indicate uncertainty or potential risks. There's no clear dominant factor that consistently makes the stock look better or worse. It seems like a combination of mixed signals, so I'm leaning towards a neutral stance because there isn't enough direction to determine a clear trend.

Therefore, after evaluating each tweet and considering their collective impact, I'll conclude with aneutral sentiment."
2014-03-24,Negative,"Okay, I need to figure out how the given tweets impact the stock price of a company. Let me start by identifying the target stock from each tweet.

Looking at the first tweet: ""momentum and concept stocks $ fb , $ feye , $ lnkd , $ twtr , $ amzn , $ ubnt taking on a chin."" Hmm, the user mentions ""taking on a chin,"" which seems like a negative sentiment. So I'll note that as negative.

Next, the second tweet talks about $ wmt (NYSE) for Wal-Mart stores and uses URLs. This is about the company's performance or services they provide. It doesn't specify positive or negative info immediately, so maybe neutral? Or could it be negative if Wal-Mart is known for its issues?

Third tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ amzn and $ goog cloud services are increasingly utilizing more bandwidth $ nflx $ fb $ vz URL."" The user mentions cloud services being used more by Amzn and Google. Cloud companies can fluctuate in stock, so I'm not sure yet; it might be neutral or even positive if they expect growth.

Fourth tweet: ""badger : thanks swatmod , gui , sold all 370 puts bought at 2s sold at 9.1 - chat $ nflx $ amzn $ ddd $ fslr $ gs."" This seems like a transaction, specifically selling options. It doesn't mention positive or negative sentiment about the stock itself but might indicate investor interest or expectations.

Fifth tweet: ""great exposure for $ sglb @ URL ( march 24-26 ): in attendance will be $ ddd $ ssys $ amzn $ adsk $ f $ c $ lmt $ hon."" It mentions SGLB, which I'm not familiar with. Maybe it's a typo or irrelevant? The mention of March dates could indicate a trend change, but without info on SGLB, it's hard to say.

Sixth tweet: ""great exposure for $ sglb @ URL ( march 24-26 ): in attendance will be $ ddd $ ssys $ amzn $ adsk $ f $ c $ lmt $ hon."" Same issue as the fifth; no specific info on SGLB. Maybe neutral again.

Putting it all together, each tweet seems to have mixed emotions or maybe a mix of factors. The first one is definitely negative because of ""taking on a chin."" The others are more transactional and could be either, but without clear sentiment about the stock itself."
2014-03-25,Positive,"Alright, let's break down the problem step by step. The task is to analyze some tweets related to Amazon and determine their impact on the company's stock price. The possible outcomes are [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative].

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. But looking at the provided tweets, it seems like each tweet might be separate entries for different stocks or perhaps a mix. However, since only one stock is mentioned in the output requirement, maybe we're focusing on Amazon's performance here.

Next, I'll go through each tweet individually to extract factors and assess sentiment. 

1. The first tweet has a URL with multiple words separated by spaces, which could be indicating that the user is tracking certain keywords related to Amazon. It includes a mix of other stocks but doesn't specify if it relates to AMZN.

2. The second tweet seems to mention ""aiming to be $ amzn of ngs dx"" and talks about rapid adoption of a gene test. This suggests positive information for Amazon, which might boost investor sentiment positively.

3. The third tweet is from 2023 and mentions that Amazon is paying for e-book settlement cash back to Kindle users. This indicates Amazon is expanding its marketing or partnerships, which could positively influence stock prices.

4. The fourth tweet is about a video analysis, but it doesn't specify what's happening with Amazon. It might be providing details on other stocks, so perhaps not directly relevant unless there are specific keywords for AMZN.

5. The fifth tweet mentions ""good news for amazon customers,"" indicating that their purchasing power has improved. This could translate to increased demand or favorable conditions in the market, which is a positive sign for Amazon's stock.

6. The sixth tweet says ""way to go"" with multiple stocks mentioned, but again, without specific AMZN keywords, it might not be directly relevant unless there are hidden messages related to Amazon.

Now, compiling these thoughts: There's a mix of positive statements about e-books, new partnerships, and improved customer conditions. These could indicate growth in demand or competitive advantages for Amazon. However, without specific context on AMZN performance relative to the market or its competitors, it's hard to be certain.

Considering the trends are positive, even if there's some uncertainty due to the lack of direct AMZN-specific indicators, the overall sentiment might lean towards [Positive]."
2014-03-26,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about Amazon's stock price. So, I have three tweets here, and each seems to talk about the company, but they're not very specific. 

First tweet is: ""$ amzn - facebook takes $2B leap into virtual reality -> URL stock stocks stockaction"". Hmm, okay, so FB is taking huge strides into VR. That's a positive sign because companies investing in emerging technologies often show strong growth. But wait, it just mentions Facebook and VR without giving more context.

Second tweet: ""looking for the next $ reg $ hfc $ mjn $ amzn singedinvestor URL"". This one is more about searching for something related to Amazon. The terms like $ reg and $ mjn don't seem familiar. Maybe they're initials or abbreviations, but it's unclear what those stand for. It could be a typo or something else entirely.

Third tweet: ""$ amzn - amazon - socialmedia love down 2% today - URL"". Here, Amazon is talking about its social media performance dropping by 2%. That's definitely negative news because if users aren't interacting with the brand as much online, it can hurt the stock. Social media impact is a big factor in company performance.

So putting it together, the first tweet is positive for Facebook and VR but no specific info on Amazon. The second tweet seems to be about searching or not finding something related. The third tweet is negative because of social media drop.

I'm not sure if I should consider all three tweets together or individually. Maybe each tweet provides some information that contributes to the overall analysis. Since the first and third tweets are directly related to Amazon, they might have a more significant impact on investor sentiment than the second one about looking for something else.

If I look at the other factors: Positive factors from the third tweet about social media. Negative factor is the social media drop from the third tweet. But without more context or specific details from each tweet, it's hard to weigh them all.

I'm leaning towards a negative sentiment because of the social media performance dropping and no clear positive info. But I also notice that Facebook's move into VR could have positive implications if it leads to increased revenue in that area."
2014-03-27,Positive,"Okay, I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I remember from the solving process that I should identify the target stock symbol and then evaluate each tweet as Positive, Negative, or Neutral based on factors like factors extracted, sentiment analysis, and an overall summary.

Looking at the tweets provided:

1. ""rt AT_USER amazon's free streaming service for prime customers to feature rick astley's complete music video library . $ amzn"" – This seems positive because it mentions Amazon offering a premium streaming service for customers who are considered prime customers, which can attract more users and increase sales.

2. ""rt AT_USER the ongoing price war between $ goog and $ amzn on public clouds is excellent news for startups."" – The negative part here is that there's a price war affecting major competitors like Google, which might hurt startups because they have to compete with these big companies. This suggests potential negative sentiment.

3. ""should you buy , sell or hold $ big $ rgld $ asna $ amzn try this URL"" – This tweet is more about offering advice on buying/selling stocks but doesn't directly mention Amazon's performance or any positive/negative factors related to it. It seems neutral because the content isn't focused on stock performance.

4. ""AT_USER how's this for new index ? 'tank . '' $ tsla , $ amzn , $ nflx , and $ king ."" – The tweet is asking about a new index, which doesn’t directly relate to Amazon or its stock price. It seems neutral because there’s no mention of Amazon's performance.

5. ""rt AT_USER url plans free , ad-supported streaming tv & music service in coming months - dj • $ amzn"" – This mentions an upcoming streaming service with ads, which could attract a wider audience. The positive part is the ad-supported aspect, so this is a positive tweet for Amazon's stock because it might boost sales.

6. ""rt AT_USER the ongoing price war between $ goog and $ amzn on public clouds is excellent news for startups."" – Same as tweet 2, another negative tweet due to competing companies affecting startups negatively.

7. ""would you like great research on stocks $ biib $ ltd $ eqr $ amzn equity URL"" – This seems more promotional in terms of research but doesn't mention Amazon's performance or stock sentiment. It might be neutral because it's about content rather than company news.

8. "" $ amzn amazon ’ s long-rumored media console product will likely be revealed april 2 URL"" – This is a positive tweet suggesting that Amazon has a rumored project coming up, which could be seen as a strategic move and potentially good for the stock price. However, since it's about a development rather than performance data, it might lean towards neutral.

9. "" $ amzn amazon will reportedly launch a free video streaming service URL"" – Similar to tweet 3, this is a positive offer but not directly related to Amazon's stock performance.

10. ""rt AT_USER url plans free , ad-supported streaming tv & music service in coming months - dj • $ amzn"" – Another positive tweet offering services with ads, which can boost sales and thus the stock price positively.

Now, I need to summarize the factors for each tweet. For example, tweet 1 is a clear positive about Amazon's streaming service. Tweets 5 and 8 are more promotional but not directly related to performance data, so they might be neutral or mixed. The rest of the tweets either have conflicting sentiments (tweets 2 and 6) or focus on other areas without impact on Amazon.

Overall, the most significant positive tweets are 1, 5, 8, 9, and 10. Some negative tweets are 2 and 6. The neutral ones are 3,4,7. Combining these, the overall sentiment seems mixed but leans towards positive because there are clear opportunities and some supportive information.

So, putting it all together, I think the stock has a mix of positive and negative influences. However, since there's room for positivity from multiple sources, maybe the positive impact is significant enough to make it Positive."
2014-03-28,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out the overall impact on Amazon's stock price based on these tweets. So first, I need to look at each tweet and see if they give any positive or negative signals.

Looking at tweet 1, it says $ amzn rsi is now at 28.5, which means oversold. That suggests that the market might be overvaluing Amazon's stock because when RSI drops below 30, it's considered oversold and investors might buy more.

Tweet 2 talks about Amazon considering a data center in Germany and mentions WSJ's report. Data centers are important for manufacturing, so if Amazon is investing here, that could drive demand and potentially boost the stock price.

 Tweet 3 says Amazon is ready to join the price increase party due to Pandora being ready. If Pandora is already a big company in tech or gaming, this might indicate growth opportunities, which would be positive.

Tweet 4 mentions Netflix acquiring print rights. The printing business has been on the rise with things like e-commerce and digital content, so if Amazon takes that, it could drive additional revenue and increase stock value.

Tweet 5 is about research on $ clr, $ CHTR, and $ LGF for Amazon. Stock research can be seen as a positive investment strategy since it's proactive in making informed decisions, which might lead to better trading decisions down the line.

Tweet 6 also talks about the good and bad factors with Amazon. This could mean both strong points (good) and some areas needing attention (bad), but overall, the positive aspect is important to consider without leaning too heavily on it.

Tweet 7 suggests avoiding losing by interacting with $ GCI, $ LMCA, $ ENDP, or $ AMZN as investors. Investors sometimes avoid certain stocks due to concerns about them, so this could lead to a cautious approach to stock diversification.

Tweet 8 is about short coverings for S&P 500, NDX, FB, AMZN, ESM, and DIA. Short coverings involve betting on stock price movements, which can be a strategy but might also indicate concerns about the broader market performance.

Tweet 9 talks about $ AMZN listening to the fly news today. This could imply that the market is paying attention to current events or trends related to Amazon, which might influence sentiment positively as companies adjust accordingly.

Lastly, tweet 10 mentions several tech stocks and a NFLX (New York Times) on the pre-market. Tech sectors are booming, especially with recent innovation advancements, so this could boost overall sentiment.

Putting it all together, while there are some negative factors like overselling in RSI and a cautionary note about losing investments, the positive elements like growth opportunities from Pandora, Netflix acquisition, stock research, and tech trends seem to outweigh the negatives. The focus on emerging markets with data centers is also a good sign for future performance."
2014-03-29,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets about Amazon's stock price impact on its future stock price. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

First tweet: ""310 , then 280 look like a natural targets for $ amzn if it continues to sell off ( weekly chart ) . URL"". Hmm, the number at the end doesn't seem relevant here. The tweet mentions that Amazon's target prices are around $310 and $280, implying they're watching its stock price. It says this is likely because the weekly chart shows the stock is selling off. So the sentiment here is positive because it expects Amazon to continue losing money but still hold onto the stock.

Second tweet: ""$ amzn u . s . judge oks class action in e-book suit against apple URL"". This seems like a news story about Amazon winning a case involving an e-book deal with Apple. Class actions can indicate significant events, especially if they're related to revenue or stock deals. Positive sentiment because the company is handling a major legal matter and could impact its financials.

Third tweet: ""$ slm $ sbny $ d $ amzn view now URL"". This seems like a generic tweet about Amazon. There's no specific information here; it's just a request for the user to view Amazon's website or something similar. Without any positive or negative cues, this tweet doesn't provide much insight into Amazon's stock performance.

So, analyzing each tweet: The first is positive because of expectations of continued losses but holding onto the stock. The second is positive due to handling a class action. The third is neutral because it's just a generic request without information affecting sentiment."
2014-03-30,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets about the stock price of AMZN (Amazon). Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. The words in the tweets include terms like $ gpn $ dnb $ ghc $ amzn, so it seems like AMZN is the main stock symbol here. 

Now, looking at each tweet:

1. ""could be breaktout time on $ gpn $ dnb $ ghc $ amzn check out URL"" — This one doesn't mention AMZN or any related company except for these specific tokens. The mention of ""breakout time"" suggests a potential release event or earnings report, which could impact the stock price but isn't directly about AMZN itself.

2. ""should you hold or add to $ awh $ htz $ gci $ amzn overvalued URL"" — Again, this tweet is about another company, AWH (which I'm not familiar with), and mentions AMZN in an unrelated context. It doesn't mention AMZN directly but talks about adding it to a portfolio which might be speculative.

3. ""jake 13 : stock dd board : amzn stock 338.29 $ amzn current buy rating : 100 % URL"" — This one is definitely about AMZN. It mentions the stock price at $338.29, which I'm not sure of the exact figure, and has a ""current buy rating"" from 100%. A buy rating suggests investor sentiment towards AMZN.

4. ""great stock newsletter you must have $ ivz $ mxim $ uri $ amzn overvalued URL"" — Similar to tweet 2, this is about another company, IVZ (I'm not sure what that stands for), and mentions AMZN in an unrelated context. It's speculative without directly mentioning AMZN.

Next, I need to assess the sentiment of each tweet towards AMZN. 

- Tweet 1: Talks about a potential event but doesn't mention AMZN directly.
- Tweet 2: Focuses on another company, so no direct link to AMZN.
- Tweet 3: Has a buy rating suggesting positive outlook for AMZN.
- Tweet 4: Also speculatively mentions AMZN without direct connection.

Since none of the tweets specifically mention AMZN or provide information about it, I can't determine its impact on the stock price. Therefore, there's no clear sentiment based on these tweets alone."
2014-03-31,Negative,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided a set of tweets, but they don't include a specific company symbol. Without knowing which stock, it's a bit tricky because each tweet could be referring to different companies based on the words used.

Looking at the tweets:

1. "" spy $ aapl $ yy $ sina $ fb $ ddd $ amzn $ aria bears ready to give up URL""
2. "" in some ways , it ’ s looking like 1999 in the stock market ' look at p / e for $ am zn & $ fb url""
3. "" rt AT_USER is the nasdaq bubble beginning to burst ? URL $ aapl apple $ amzn $ fb $ goog $ intc $ msft $ nflx $ spy $ tsla …""
4. ""$ amzn amazon's alpha house wins re-election , six new series set to debut URL""
5. ""rt AT_USER masters of the app preload : URL AT_USER mobile apps preloadedapps dropbox $ amzn $ twtr evernote $ …""
6. ""looking for the next winners like $ trw $ axp $ crm $ amzn view now URL""
7. ""dont want to lose like you did with $ zmh $ rlgy $ ilmn $ amzn click URL""
8.""$ amzn [ video ] make mine a maker : more streaming entertainment m & a on the way URL""
9. ""$ ev / revenue : scary heights of social media stocks URL $ fb $ amzn $ twtr $ yelp $ socl""
10. ""theflynews : $ amzn $ nflx amazon advances after analyst sees most prime users keeping service : full story URL""
11. ""$ mub barely red buy ny muni cef a wall of red as muppets sell to get back into $ amzn $ fb $ sne ... mo-mo back""

Hmm, I notice that the first tweet seems to be listing multiple stocks. The second tweet mentions AMZN and FB. Third tweet talks about the NASDAQ bubble burst and references several companies. Fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, tenth tweets are all about Amazon (AMZN). The rest seem related to social media stocks or other companies.

Since each tweet is about a different company, it's impossible to determine a single stock's impact without knowing which one the user is referring to. Without this information, my analysis can't be accurate because each tweet could represent any number of companies, and their performance would vary independently.

I think I need more context or specific details about the target stock mentioned in these tweets. Once I have that, I can assess whether the overall sentiment is positive, neutral, or negative based on the factors like earnings reports, analyst reviews, competitive positioning, etc."
2014-04-01,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of Amazon (AMZN) for $16.94 today. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from each tweet, which seems straightforward here since all the mentions are about AMZN. Now, each tweet needs to be evaluated in terms of positive, negative, or neutral factors affecting investor sentiment regarding Amazon's stock price.

Starting with the first tweet: ""$ amzn stock quote , 2:17 pm : 342.81 +6.445 ( +1.92 % ) . "" This looks like a typical news report showing the stock's price change and percentage increase. It directly mentions the stock quote, which is a significant factor as it's a live update on the company's performance.

Next tweet: ""do you need stock research on $ an $ iff $ wtm $ amzn wealthmanagement URL"" Hmm, this seems to be asking about stock research related to wealth management. The mention of ""wealth management"" and the URL suggests that someone is looking into financial services but isn't sure how it relates to Amazon. It might not directly affect AMZN's performance.

Third tweet: ""AT_USER im not long dipshit , i'm a trader i look for entries and i sell put spreads : i look for volatility $ tsla $ amzn $ lnkd etc."" This one seems to be from an investor who is trading stocks. He mentions looking for entries, selling put spreads, and focusing on volatility in TSLA (tesla) and AMZN. If he's actively trading, that can indicate a bullish or bearish stance depending on his strategy.

Fourth tweet: ""rt AT_USER april fukken fools ! & $ lvgi inked a deal with $ goog $ amzn $ ge $ phot $ ebay $ msft $ aapl to sell ~ ~ ~ > URL"" This is an RT message, which usually attracts replies. It mentions April fools, a company, and multiple other companies that Amazon is targeting for deals. If there are deals or partnerships, it can influence investor sentiment positively if the expected gains outweigh any potential losses.

Fifth tweet: ""when we lose money , it's a loss . when $ amzn loses money , it's an investment . it's ludicrous . "" The quotes here seem like warnings or opinions from Greg Maffei. He's warning about the absurdity of losing money, implying that losing can be seen as an investment opportunity rather than loss. This could create concern among investors, leading to a negative sentiment.

Sixth tweet: ""rt AT_USER retailers bleed as $ amzn hits them hard URL"" Again, from an RT message, this seems like a reply or response. The mention of retailers and the sentiment about AMZN's performance causing issues in retail might indicate investor concerns if people are worried about revenue or profitability from Amazon.

Seventh tweet: ""$ tsla weak but $ nflx and $ amzn strong . who's going to give ?"" This is another RT message. It suggests that while Tesla (TSLA) is down, Amazon is stable. The uncertainty about which one will perform better could affect investor expectations, potentially causing either a bullish or bearish trend.

Eighth tweet: ""rt AT_USER how ipad , samsung galaxy and kindle fire owners use their tablets : URL $ amzn $ aapl URL"" This again appears to be an RT message. It talks about how consumers are using their tablets for specific purposes (ipad, Samsung Galaxy, Kindle Fire) and relates it to Amazon's stock. If there's concern that using tech products leads people to buy Amazon stocks, this could influence sentiment.

Ninth tweet: ""$ temn ran 405.55 % for our subscribers in 2 weeks ! get the next pick early : URL $ amzn $ qcom $ csco"" This is an RT message from a user questioning the growth of their subscriber base. The mention of percentage increase suggests that they're seeing significant gains, which could be positive news for Amazon if it's related to product sales or services.

Tenth tweet: ""rt AT_USER how ipad , samsung galaxy and kindle fire owners use their tablets : URL $ amzn $ aapl URL"" Similar structure as tweet 8. It's another RT message discussing consumer trends on tech products and linking them to Amazon's stock. If the user believes that tech purchases drive sales, this could create positive sentiment.

Eleventh tweet: ""$ amzn the secrets and clues of the official game of thrones maps URL"" This is an RT message with a link to a game show. While it might not directly relate to AMZN stock performance, if someone is discussing strategies for Amazon or seeing potential trends from games, it could influence investor sentiment.

Twelfth tweet: ""AT_USER way to go ! here is why URL you are leading your $ amzn $ aapl e9e2f takethisbet"" This appears to be another RT message. The mention of leadership and reasons for the user's lead suggests that they might see positive trends, which could boost AMZN's stock.

Thirteenth tweet: ""$ aapl next week is expected to hit 18 billion."" This is an RT message from a user looking ahead to future sales. If they expect AMZN to grow in the coming weeks, this could be seen as a bullish signal for investors.

Now, summarizing each tweet's impact:
- Positive tweets often discuss trends, growth expectations, deals, or positive news.
- Negative tweets might talk about losses, concerns, or skepticism.
- Neutral can include general information without clear sentiment shift.

Looking at all these, the main indicators are:
- Trading activity (tweets 3 and 10)
- Stock price movements (+6.445, +1.92 % in tweet 1)
- Market reactions from Twitter accounts (tweets 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13)

The most conflicting or positive elements seem to be tweets 3 and 7, which indicate active trading, potentially bullish, while others are either neutral or bearish. The negative tweet is 5, which criticizes the company's losses.

Overall sentiment seems mixed but leans towards positive due to trading activity and the initial stock price increase."
2014-04-02,Neutral,"Alright, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at each tweet individually: There are a mix of positive and negative sentiments expressed. Some mention that Amazon is introducing a new streaming device called Fire TV, which could affect their revenue streams. Others talk about competitors like Roku, Apple, and Google using their devices, which might lower prices or limit competition. There's also some confusion about the impact on company stock, especially whether $ nflx, an index related to Amazon, is affected.

I'll start by summarizing each tweet. The first one talks about Fire TV being cheaper than competitors but says it'll be shipped today. Another tweet mentions that Fire TV will compete with Roku, Apple, and Google in smart TVs, which could affect their revenue. Then, a tweet from a user comments on the launch of Fire TV targeting smart TVs.

I notice some tweets are making the company sound like Amazon is entering a new market segment (smart TVs) but others are downplaying it, suggesting they think Fire TV might not be as popular or competitive in that area. There's no mention of any positive news about the stock except for one tweet where Fire TV could rotate over others.

Considering all these factors: Fire TV introduces value through smart TVs but also competes with established players. The company hasn't explicitly stated if their stock is up, down, or neutral. I need to weigh the potential gains from new products against any risks of competition and whether the user base for Amazon's product line expands enough.

I think there's a mix of optimism because Fire TV could be a hit, but also some uncertainty since competitors are already in play. However, the tweet that mentions Fire TV will compete with others might suggest they're cautious about changes to maintain standing. Without specific sales data or analyst reports, it's hard to pin down a clear sentiment score.

So, putting it all together, I'm leaning towards an Neutral overall sentiment because while there are positives like introducing new products and potential revenue growth, the negative factors of competition and uncertainty from competitors suggest some doubt without strong support."
2014-04-03,Positive,"Okay, so I need to determine the likely impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet one by one and think about how they affect investor sentiment.

1. The first tweet mentions a stock watchlist with $ bmrn $ rgld $ now $ amzn click URL. That sounds like it's suggesting that Amazon is on the radar, but I don't see any positive or negative signs here. It seems neutral in nature.

2. The second tweet talks about watching Roku, Google, and Apple but focuses on Amazon's unveiling of a video streaming device. This could be seen as a positive signal because it suggests the company is expanding into new areas, which might attract investors. So that gives me a positive sign.

3. The third tweet is about how Amazon's video streaming device is being disrupted by something else. This seems like bad news for Amazon if their tech isn't working out well. That would likely lead to negative sentiment.

4. Fourth tweet is a chart comparing Amazon FireTV to other streaming devices, but no specific information on the outcome of that comparison. It's more about data than opinions, so it might not significantly impact sentiment yet.

5. Fifth tweet details how Amazon paired their $6 HDMI cable with FireTV and mentioned a $3.99 shipping fee. That sounds like technical issues or a cost-prohibitive factor for consumers. This could make people concerned about Amazon's products, leading to negative sentiment.

6. Sixth tweet compares Amazon FireTV with streaming options but mentions no specific information. It might not provide enough context, so it doesn't add much to the analysis yet.

7. Seventh tweet introduces the stocks that Amazon is investing in: $ trw $ wbc $ abt $ amzn $ goog. This could mean a positive note about expanding into new markets or tech, which might be good for sentiment. But without details on how these investments perform, it's speculative.

8. Eighth tweet says Amazon is wasting its time. If the company seems indifferent to their products, that's a negative sign because it shows inconsistency and lack of focus.

9. Ninth tweet announces FireTV as an Android-powered streaming set-top box. This could be seen as a product launch with potential market success or failure, which can affect sentiment.

10. Tenth tweet compares features of AmazonFireTV to Apple TV, Chromecast, and Roku. While this is specific information about the product, it's not giving enough context on how well it might perform yet.

11. Eleventh tweet says FireTV isn't great for video games but excellent for video. This is a mixed signal because while it's good for video streaming, it may have limitations in other areas, which could lead to mixed sentiment.

12. Twelfth tweet suggests considering $ fe $ pcg $ dwa for Amazon and advising on holding $ amzn. No specific performance data, so this might not be enough to determine a strong impact yet.

Putting all these together, the main positive points come from the third tweet and the eighth tweet. The negative points include tweets 5, 10, 9, 11, and 12. However, since many of the negative tweets don't provide enough context or specific reasons for concern, they might not have a decisive impact yet.

But considering the broader market trends, if FireTV is performing well despite some technical issues mentioned in tweet 5, that could counterbalance the concerns about the shipping fee. Additionally, the expansion into Android tech might open up new markets, which is a positive sign. However, the lack of specific performance data from FireTV makes it hard to say for sure.

Overall, while there are mixed signals, some tweets provide strong evidence of growth or success (tweets 1, 2, 9, and 10), and others show concern about issues like shipping fees or potential tech failures. However, without more context on how these factors play out, it's hard to make a definitive conclusion.

But considering the positive trends from FireTV expansion and any reported success in the specific area where it might fail, and given that other tweets don't contradict this, maybe there is still some positive sentiment overall."
2014-04-04,Negative,"Okay, so I have to analyze these tweets and determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative for Amazon's stock price impact. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet mentions holding stocks and suggests a URL but doesn't give any specific information about Amazon.
2. The second tweet says Amazon is selling more online than its top competitors combined. This seems like positive because it shows Amazon has strong online sales, which can boost revenue.
3. Third tweet talks about support level hitting $320, implying potential for a price increase if it recovers below $310. This could be positive for investors who are watching the stock.
4. Fourth tweet discusses stock symbols and other companies, doesn't offer any insights on Amazon.
5. Fifth tweet mentions Amazon entering a bear market after a 22% drop from last year's high. Negative sentiment because it's a significant downturn in an otherwise resilient company.
6. Sixth tweet talks about next $amzn $dds $abbv research. It might not directly relate to Amazon, but the stock is mentioned, which could be neutral as other factors might influence.
7. Seventh tweet is about pennystock research on $bbby and $pcl. Again, unrelated to Amazon unless it's a broader market trend affecting similar stocks.
8. Eighth tweet mentions Amazon entering a bear market from last year's high. This reinforces the previous negative sentiment about Amazon.
9. Ninth tweet updates options view or all options views. Not specific info about Amazon.
10. Tenth tweet refers to ""former market leader"" entering a bear market, which could indicate positive expectations given prior success but might still be guarded by fear of broader market downturn.
11. Eleventh tweet is looking for next $amzn dds $abbv research. Doesn't relate directly unless it's a competitive advantage factor.
12. Twelfth tweet targets large options traders with a target URL, but no info on Amazon.
13. Thirteenth tweet mentions pennystock and ingr stock, again unrelated to Amazon.
14. Fourteenth tweet is about the market being concerned about Amazon's competition, which would be negative as it affects its position.
15. Fifteenth tweet uses ""game of thrones"" metaphor for money, seems casual but could imply positive investment advice or trends.
16. Sixteenth tweet again mentions $mcd and $tmo. No info on Amazon.
17. Seventeenth tweet talks about internet stocks being pummed down by Facebook and Google, which might indicate weaker tech companies, not directly related to Amazon.

Now, compiling the sentiment:

- Positive tweets: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. They talk about Amazon's online presence or market performance.
- Neutral tweets: 4, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. Some mention other companies, others are speculative.
- Negative tweets: 1, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17? Wait, no. Let me recount:

Looking again:

Positive tweets:
2. Positive about sales online.
3. Support level hitting a certain point.
5. Drop in price.
8. Concern about competition.
9. UpDATES on options view.
10. Market entering bear market.
14. Concern about competition.

Negative tweets:
4, 7, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17. That's eight negative tweets.

So overall sentiment: Most are positive except several negatives. But the user asks for a single conclusion. The key points are the drop in price (tweets 5,8,9), market entering bear market (tens 10, which is about investor reactions), and concern about competition (tens 4,7,14). These seem to reinforce the negative sentiment because Amazon's performance across these areas suggests uncertainty or risk."
2014-04-05,Positive,"Alright, let's try to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon (AMZN) stock. I'll go through each tweet step by step.

1. **First Tweet:** ""bad invesments like got you down $ cna $ avx $ voya $ amzn newsletter URL"" – Hmm, this seems negative because it mentions bad investments and a newsletter. That sounds discouraging, so maybe the sentiment is Negative.

2. **Second Tweet:** ""avoid mistakes like $ tss $ l $ cb $ amzn equity URL"" – Again, there are mentions of avoiding mistakes related to equity. This could lead investors to avoid risky stocks, which might decrease demand and thus affect AMZN's price. So another negative thought.

3. **Third Tweet:** ""are you looking for more winners like $ jbl $ amzn $ cboe $ qlys i suggest URL"" – Positive because they're encouraging more positive stocks. This could boost confidence, making investors feel better about buying AMZN. Positive sentiment here.

4. **Fourth Tweet:** ""$ amzn - wall st week ahead - momentum names may see more pain -> URL stock stocks stockaction"" – Negative because it talks about increased pain or losses for momentum stocks. Investors are worried about the future performance, which can reduce their buy pressure. Negative overall effect.

5. **Fifth Tweet:** ""stock watchlist you should be looking at $ rok $ g $ fe $ amzn click URL"" – Positive as it suggests adding AMZN to a watchlist, which could increase demand and drive up the stock price. Positive sentiment.

6. **Sixth Tweet:** ""insideer trading alerts on $ csl $ lnt $ bhi $ amzn investing URL"" – Negative because inside trading alert implies risky behavior or potential losses for investors. This can negatively impact AMZN's confidence, leading to a negative outcome.

7. **Seventh Tweet:** ""are you putting your money in $ sfg $ flt $ cprt $ amzn liquidity URL"" – Positive again since it suggests putting money into liquid stocks. More buying power could boost AMZN's price. Positive sentiment.

8. **Eighth Tweet:** ""$ amzn oi for maturity 04/11 / 2014 . 320.00 highest put . 350.00 highest call . URL"" – Negative because mentions options trading, which can be volatile and risky. This could cause market concern or decrease demand, leading to a negative impact.

9. **Ninth Tweet:** ""$ amzn amazon's fire tv could be the holy grail of set-top boxes URL"" – Positive as suggesting a tech innovation that could benefit AMZN. Innovation often leads to growth, so this is encouraging. Positive sentiment.

10. **Tenth Tweet:** ""$ amzn - amazons dash lets you refill your pantry using your voice and lasers -> URL stock stocks stockaction"" – Negative because it talks about refilling pantry items via tech innovation. This seems speculative but could lead to more demand for Amazon's products, potentially boosting the stock price.

Now, summarizing all these thoughts: The tweet mentions various negative points like inversions, inside trading alerts, options trading, and a tech Innovation. However, there are positive tweets encouraging investments in winners or liquid stocks. The overall sentiment seems mixed but leans towards Positive because several positive points (tweets 3,5,7,9) counterbalance the negatives.

I think it's better to consider them as [Positive]."
2014-04-06,Positive,"Okay, so I have to analyze these tweets about Amazon's stock and determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative in impact on the future stock price. Hmm, let me start by going through each tweet one by one.

First tweet: ""todays movers to research $ m mxim $ dva $ amzn nasdaq URL"". That seems like a direct mention of Amazon's stock with some symbols mixed up, maybe a typo. I don't see any positive or negative info here; it looks more like a call for action rather than a statement about the stock.

Second tweet: ""Our hot penny stock alerts, gained 2,100 % in 4 weeks! Subscribe today: URL $ orcl $ yhoo $ amzn"". So this one is selling something they think will gain big gains. It's talking about subscription services and mentions both Amazon and YHOO, which I don't recognize as stock symbols. The sentiment here seems positive because it expects growth and offers a service.

Third tweet: ""How ipad, samsung galaxy and kindle fire owners use their tablets: URL $ amzn $ aapl URL"". This one is talking about users of iPads, Samsung Galaxy phones, and Kindle Fire on Amazon. It doesn't mention any stock performance or opinions on the company's performance. So this is more of an informational tweet rather than a sentiment-based statement.

Fourth tweet: ""If ' $ amzn fails at 323.2 then 315.61 and 303.3 will be my lower targets . major support at 323 & 310.86 . $ qqq $ nq_f $ es_f $ tf_f $ spy"". This is a prediction about Amazon's stock target prices if it fails. It expresses confidence in the stock and offers specific price targets. This seems like a positive outlook for investors who want to buy more at higher prices.

Fifth tweet: ""Amazon's fire tv will flame out URL via AT_USER $ aapl $ nflx $ msft $ sne $ amzn"". This is talking about Amazon's Fire TV product line going out of business. It mentions other companies like NFLX (which I don't recognize as a stock) and others. The sentiment here is negative because it's predicting something that's likely to happen, which would probably hurt Amazon's stock price.

Sixth tweet: ""Netflix be damned , cable told to pass on higher costs URL ibdnews via AT_USER $ nflx $ cmcsa $ dis $ amzn $ goog $ tw"". This one is talking about Netflix and cable companies informing users that they'll pay more. It seems like a financial warning, but I don't see any positive or negative information about Amazon's performance here.

Seventh tweet: ""Awesome stock research on $ cop $ int $ tfx $ amzn stock URL"". Similar to the first one, this is selling stock on Amazon with some symbols misformatted. Not a direct statement about Amazon's stock price movement.

Now, putting it all together: The second tweet expects positive growth and offers a service, so that's definitely positive. The fourth tweet has a strong outlook for lower targets if Amazon fails, which would be another positive. The first tweet is more of an offer than any sentiment. The fifth tweet is negative because it's predicting something will go out of business, affecting the stock. The third and seventh tweets are informational and don't have sentiment.

So overall, I think most of them are positive. But maybe the fourth one has a slight positive note about lower targets but not too strong. The fifth tweet leans negative."
2014-04-07,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze the given tweets to determine their impact on Amazon's future stock price. Let me break down each tweet step by step.

1. **Understanding the Target Stock**: The main stock mentioned is Amazon (AMZN). I'll focus on its performance based on the provided tweets.

2. **Analyzing Each Tweet**:
   - **Tweet 1**: Talks about picking shows from pilots with over 2 million viewers. This seems like positive buzz but not specific to AMZN's product.
   - **Tweet 2**: A mix of stock prices (EWBC, WAFD, MDT) and other exchanges. It mentions the user is holding a lot of shares, which might indicate sentiment towards Amazon but without specifics on performance.
   - **Tweet 3**: Links Apple, Google, and Kindle Fire devices. Again, this is about products, not AMZN's stock.
   - **Tweet 4**: Discusses the importance of Amazon's Fire TV in an earnings season. This could relate to future performance if the Fire TV is a product line that impacts revenue.
   - **Tweet 5**: Suggests closing Amazon Europe down after US sales. This ties into general market trends affecting AMZN's stock price.
   - **Tweet 6**: Similar to Tweet 1, another positive sentiment but again without specific details on AMZN's performance.
   - **Tweets 7 and 8**: Repeat of Tweet 6, reinforcing the same analysis.
   - **Tweet 9**: Discusses ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) related to Amazon. ETFs can impact stock prices indirectly through diversification strategies.
   - **Tweet 10**: Provides a forecast for YHOO (Google), not directly related to AMZN but could influence investor expectations and stock movements.
   - **Tweet 11**: Claims Amazon is being bought by bull forces, which might suggest strategic buys that could boost the stock price.

3. **Overall Sentiment Summary**:
   - The tweets mention positive mentions of products and specific pilots but don't provide detailed financial or market insights into AMZN's performance.
   - There are mixed reactions with some tweets suggesting future growth (Tweet 4 about Fire TV) and others pointing to general market trends (Tweets 1,5,6).
   - No direct information on recent earnings, earnings history, or specific company financials.

Given the lack of concrete data on AMZN's performance, trends, or financial statements, it's challenging to definitively label the sentiment as Positive, Neutral, or Negative. However, considering factors like product demand, market trends, and diversification strategies (Tweet 9), there might be some positive aspects influencing the stock price.

Since the analysis is incomplete due to missing specific financial data, I can't give a clear binary classification. Therefore, it's appropriate to acknowledge that the sentiment isn't fully established based on the provided tweets."
2014-04-08,Neutral,"Alright, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's future stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet is an alert about the stock market. It mentions $ amzn, so that's a positive sign because it could mean good news for Amazon.
2. The second tweet talks about avoiding mistakes like using $ thx and $ ttc. This seems to be a warning or a cautionary message. People might be worried about investing, which could impact the stock price negatively.
3. The third tweet is a comment on how building a website is similar to Amex's approach. It doesn't mention anything about Amazon's stock performance but talks more about business practices, so I'm not sure it affects the stock directly.
4. The fourth tweet mentions $ amzn launching Fire TV and pushes sales of digital content. This could be positive because companies like Amazon are investing in new products that might increase demand and thus the stock price.
5. The fifth tweet says $ amzn where selling could stop for tech. Similar to tweet 2, this is a warning about customer behavior which might lead to reduced demand and negative sentiment.
6. Tweets 6-10 discuss financial losses from investments like SCTY, TSU, etc. This directly impacts the stock price negatively because losing money would lower investor confidence and affect the overall market.
7. Tweets 11 talks about amzn defending a cable deal with Comcast, which might be related to company strategies but doesn't provide direct information on Amazon's financial performance.
8-10: These tweets mention insider trading alerts, which could indicate some negative news or potential risks to investors.

Putting it all together, there are several positive tweets like 1 and 4 that point towards good news. However, there are multiple negative tweets (2,5,6,7,9,10) indicating concerns about financial performance and market sentiment. The overall sentiment seems mixed but leaning towards [Neutral] because while some aspects are positive, the significant negative tweets have a more substantial impact."
2014-04-09,Positive,"Okay, let's try to figure out how to analyze the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. First, I need to identify each tweet as positive, negative, or neutral in terms of sentiment.

Starting with tweet 1: It mentions Amzo's reps facing off over a deal and lists several companies involved. This seems like an internal matter but isn't directly affecting investor sentiment right now.

Then, tweet 2 talks about AWS getting a discount for hosting services and listing more competitors. This could affect the company's revenue but might not be news that will significantly change public opinion.

Tweet 3 is very positive with Amazon's stock listed as bullish across multiple companies. This is a clear indication of strong investor sentiment from other investors, which likely boosts Amazon's stock price positively.

Tweets 4-7 discuss AMZN being added to investor's watch lists and competing tech companies closing down. These are internal news but might not have immediate implications for the stock price unless they're unexpected or major news events.

Tweet 8 says that Amazon is now the third largest video site, which could be a positive sign if it leads others to improve their services, potentially increasing demand for Amazon's products and thus stock price growth.

Tweets 9 suggests that the stock may fall further, implying uncertainty about future performance, which can make investors nervous and reduce confidence in the stock value.

Putting this together, most tweets are neutral or slightly positive with a few minor negatives. The main factors point towards strong investor sentiment from other companies, which is a good sign for Amazon's stock. However, the negative tweet about the stock falling further could be a red flag but isn't overwhelmingly strong."
2014-04-10,Positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by going through each tweet one by one.

First, the first tweet is ""$ amzn - senators grill comcast on cable merger benefits -> URL stock stocks stockaction"". This seems like a positive sign because it mentions a cable merger benefit and the company as an investment. That's good for investors looking to hold or buy shares.

Second, the second tweet is ""$ amzn stock quote , 1:17 pm : 320.26 -11.545 ( -3.48 % ) ."". This looks like a basic financial report with a slight negative movement of about 3.48%. Maybe it's just an update on earnings or something, not the most significant news.

Third tweet is ""couple of stocks you should watch $ bll $ utx $ tsn $ amzn personalfinance URL"". This seems to be listing some stocks that Amazon might be a part of, possibly as alternatives. It doesn't directly impact Amazon's performance but could influence investor confidence if they're suggesting alternatives.

Fourth tweet is ""in nine years , the number of available $ amzn prime products has jumped from 1m to 20m . URL"". This is talking about future growth in Amazon's Prime product line, which is positive news. Growth projections are usually good for stock sentiment as it indicates potential expansion into new markets or improved services.

Fifth tweet is ""$ hrl are you thinking of selling $ lkq $ fis $ amzn newsletter URL"". This seems to be a call to action from H-RL regarding their newsletter about Amazon. They're probably suggesting they should sell the newsletter, which could mean they're not interested in future news or want to avoid it.

Sixth tweet is ""$ cam wow . great stock research on $ am znsm yod stock URL"". Again, this looks like a stock research update with some percentages (like YOD). The percentage isn't specified, but positive numbers might indicate good earnings. It could be a sign that the company is performing well.

Seventh tweet is ""$ amzn stock quote , 10:17 am : 326.18 -5.625 ( -1.70 % ) ."". Similar to the second one, it's another financial statement with a small negative movement. It might not be enough to change investor sentiment significantly.

Eighth tweet is ""$ should you hold or add to $ br $ gntx $ usm $ amzn view now URL"". This is more of an offer for investors to consider buying Amazon stock, which could increase demand and hence possibly boost the price. But it's a vague message without concrete information.

Now, let me try to piece this together. The first tweet is positive. Then there are some negative updates about earnings (second tweet), some mentions of growth potential (fourth tweet). The third tweet is listing related stocks but not directly impacting Amazon. The fifth and seventh tweets are more promotional calls or research findings. The sixth tweet is another stock update.

So overall, the first tweet is positive, then there's some downbeat news about earnings. However, future growth prospects and maybe a call to action could suggest that Amazon is poised for positive developments. But since the information isn't all together clear cut, especially without real-time data, it's hard to say for sure.

Given the potential positive future growth and the mention of alternatives (third tweet), it might lean towards a Positive overall sentiment, but I'm not entirely certain because some tweets don't provide concrete details."
2014-04-11,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets about the stock price for Amzn. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

First tweet mentions putting money in some stocks but doesn't give specifics. Second says 100% on Google and others. Third talks about bouncing after a test. Fourth mentions liquidity, fifth regretting investment. Then there are tweets with ""AT_USER"" referring to the user's thoughts on Amzn announcing building electric cars and new smartphones. More of these are in the same category.

So, most tweets are about stock performance, especially Google, Tesla, Amazon, and NVIDIA (NCLX). They're talking about their future potential, liquidity, upcoming tech developments, or even specific projects like electric vehicles.

I can see a mix: some positive for building cars, others more speculative. The user's comments suggest they're considering the stock as a possible winner, which is positive. But other tweets are more negative because of the lack of details and uncertainty about future trends.

Overall, the sentiment seems varied but leaning towards positive because many are optimistic or at least discussing potential gains. However, there are some uncertainty elements due to the technical talks about electric cars and smartphones."
2014-04-12,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by breaking down each tweet and analyzing them one by one.

First, the target stock is Amazon, symbol AMZN. Each tweet is about different aspects related to their performance or potential research.

1. The first tweet says, ""$ amzn amazon to unveil smartphone in time for winter holidays - wsj URL."" This seems like a positive sign because it mentions an upcoming product launch, which usually boosts demand and can improve financials. So, I think this is a Positive tweet.

2. The second tweet is ""$ could be breakout time on $ cr $ iff $ bbby $ amzn worth a look URL."" This looks like a news alert suggesting a potential breakthrough or high point in the stock. It might indicate that something significant is about to happen, which can increase investor interest. So again, Positive.

3. The third tweet is ""$ looking for the next $ amp $ lmca $ cnp $ amzn research URL."" This seems like it's inviting people to research further, possibly hoping for more information or analysis on Amazon's future. Research can sometimes indicate potential trends or risks, which might affect stock price. I'm not sure if this is positive or negative because it's speculative.

4. The fourth tweet mentions ""$ awesome stock research on $ amzn $ cfx $ swk $ ibm research URL."" Similar to the third tweet, this looks like it's inviting stock research, possibly looking for detailed information about AMZN's performance. Stock research can sometimes provide insights that affect prices. I'm not certain if this adds to a positive outlook or could lead to negative decisions by investors.

5. The fifth tweet is ""$ stocks you might want to hold onto $ pgr $ tsla $ ter $ amzn singedinvestor URL."" This seems like it's advising on investment strategies, suggesting that AMZN is a good candidate for holding positions because of potential future performance. This could be seen as positive by investors who are looking for growth opportunities.

Now, combining these thoughts: The tweets are mostly inviting research and analysis, which can either support or provide insights to potential investors. Some mention upcoming product launches or breakthroughs, which might boost the stock price positively. However, some are more about advice on investments rather than specific news that affects the stock directly.

I'm leaning towards a Positive overall sentiment because there's a mix of supportive information (product launches and research) and encouraging for growth opportunities. But I shouldn't be too certain since it depends on how investors interpret these tweets."
2014-04-13,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their likely impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

First tweet: ""stock market reports you need on $ iff $ nnn $ zbra $ amzn goto URL"". This sounds like a direct request for stock information or a call to action, which is usually seen as a negative signal because it might encourage the investor to buy or perform actions that could affect the stock price negatively.

Second tweet: ""great stock newsletter you must have $ uri $ mhk $ mdr $ amzn singelinvestor URL"". Similar to the first one, this seems like an announcement about the newsletter and the importance of having it. It's a proactive message aimed at keeping readers updated, which typically signals positive sentiment towards receiving more information.

Third tweet: ""are you looking for winners like $ amzn $ ca $ urs $ cbm nse url"". This is asking for specific stock names or winners to invest in. Such requests can indicate investor interest and potential trading intent, which might lead to a positive outcome if the user decides to act on it.

Fourth tweet: ""would you like great research on stocks $ key $ tfm $ cdns $ amzn economy url"". This is another inquiry inviting the reader to engage in specific activities related to Amazon. Such requests can attract attention and encourage interaction, which might positively influence investor sentiment as they become more interested in the stock.

Now, combining these thoughts: The user is requesting various services (reports, newsletters, investments, research), which suggests increased interest and potential trading activity. Each tweet is proactive in gathering information or suggesting actions that could be favorable to Amazon's stock performance.

Therefore, the overall sentiment appears positive because the tweets are encouraging more interactions and potentially beneficial actions from investors."
2014-04-14,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price and decide if they're positive, neutral, or negative. Let me start by going through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet talks about Amazon's P/E ratio compared to its competitors. It mentions premium pricing. That sounds good for a positive outlook because it suggests Amazon is outperforming others.

2. The second tweet includes a video and focuses on the CEO emphasizing organic growth. Positive signals from management can boost investor confidence, so that's another positive.

3. This one talks about Amazon selling out Fire TV on firewood until April 21, 2014. It doesn't mention much about the stock price yet, just an event happening around that time. But considering other factors and recent trends, maybe it's neutral because it's more of a future event.

4. The fourth tweet lists several companies but also mentions food tech, so I'm not sure how that affects Amazon's performance. It could be positive if the sector is booming, negative otherwise.

5. This tweet seems to ask whether to hold a certain amount invested in Amazon and other stocks. That kind of query might encourage further research or analysis rather than directly affecting the stock price.

6. The fifth tweet says that $ amzn hasn't had any sell signals in 2014. If there were no recent sell signals, it could mean support, which is positive for holding positions.

7. The sixth tweet talks about dumping Amazon calls and rolling profits into NFLX and APLX. This is a significant move by Amazon if successful, which would likely have a negative impact because it can increase Amazon's price, possibly affecting the NSE.

8. The seventh tweet mentions an earnings report leading to a jump in AMZN shares on NASDAQ. Positive news about earnings usually boosts the stock, so this is positive.

9. The eighth tweet refers to Amazon leaving payments for Amazon and Visa, which could be good if these companies are underperforming or beneficial. But it's not a huge event; probably neutral because of its short-term nature.

10. The tenth tweet mentions a research firm on other stocks but doesn't provide specifics. It might encourage further analysis, so perhaps more data to consider.

11. The eleventh tweet suggests Amazon could take on American Express or Visa in their payments business. If that's beneficial for Amazon, it would be positive.

12. The twelfth tweet asks bullish sentiment on several stocks. While positive sentiment can influence stock prices, it doesn't directly affect the price; more analysis is needed.

13. This tweet discusses Amazon's earnings with multiple companies involved but not enough details to assess a clear impact. So, neutral.

14. The fourth tweet mentions co-branded products for Amazon in 2014. If this is expected or profitable, it would be positive.

15. The fifth tweet advises getting defense ready because the market may fall down. It's more of a cautionary note suggesting potential market reaction rather than directly affecting Amazon's stock price.

Putting it all together: Positive tweets include points 1,2,8,13,14. Negative are 6 and 15. Neutral are 7 and 9,10,11. So overall sentiment is neutral because there are positive and negative points."
2014-04-15,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. I'll start by going through each tweet one by one.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol mentioned in each tweet. The first tweet mentions $ amzn is entering both smartphone and mobile payment industries. So the target stock is AmZN (Apple Inc.).

Next, for each relevant tweet, I'll separate them into positive and negative factors. Then assess the sentiment by evaluating how these factors might influence investor sentiment.

Looking at the tweets:

1. The first tweet says Amazon has entered two big industries—smartphone and mobile payment. That seems positive as it increases competition in those areas.
2. Second tweet talks about selling stocks related to blk, SLM, AMZN, and Money Management. This is a sell-off, which suggests negative sentiment for Amazon's shares.
3. Third tweet mentions MBI, PLR, M, AMZN financial stuff. This could be speculative but without specifics, it's hard to tell if positive or negative.
4. Fourth tweet about their financial prepare for an EU launch of a TV streaming set-top box. This is a strategic move by Amazon, possibly positive as it positions them better in the market.
5. Fifth tweet mentions Amazon's smartphone not being a threat to Apple via AT_USER and APL. Maybe this is a vague statement about product positioning; could be neutral or slightly negative.
6. Sixth tweet talks about looking for winners like PL, DJ, JH, AMZN on Wall Street. More selling, which might be negative sentiment.
7. Seventh tweet says losing money on dst, AOS, CSL, and AMZN newsletter. This is a loss of funds in a positive area, so likely negative.
8. Eighth tweet looks for next info on Nasdaq. More speculative selling, which could be negative.
9. Ninth tweet notes their NFLX arrival. That's a new product launch, possibly strategic but neutral or slightly positive.
10. Tenth tweet says AMZN is a problem for Google and not threatening Apple/Samsung. This seems like Amazon's position is getting worse against competitors, so negative sentiment.
11. Twelfth tweet looks for research on Str, VRSN, GNTX, AMZN financial. More selling, which might be negative.
12. Thirteenth tweet suggests buying or selling stocks based on CCL, IEX, AMZN. Speculative action without specifics could vary in sentiment.
13. Twelfth tweet is about considering to buy or sell based on the newsletter from Shw. Speculative selling could have negative effects.
14. Last tweet updates information on utx, MSG, PLCM, AMZN financial. More selling, which might lead to negative sentiment.

Now, I'll evaluate each tweet's impact:

- Positive tweets: 1, 2 (negative because of selling), 3 (speculative but perhaps positive for strategy), 4, 6, 9.
- Negative tweets: 2,5,7,8,10,12,13,14.

There are both positive and negative tweets. Positive factors like strategic launches or expanding into new industries generally support the stock. However, selling (negative) sentiment is significant because it directly affects investor confidence. The overall impact seems to lean more towards negative because there's a mix of both strong and strong negative reactions. Additionally, Amazon's position as a competitor facing backlash against Apple could lead to increased competition pressure."
2014-04-16,Positive,"Okay, I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for the given company. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll extract the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the list:

1. $ sbny - SBUX is Amazon.
2. $ amzn - AMZN is Amazon.
3. $ amzn - AMZN again.
4. $ bac , $ pfg , $ bby , $ amzn - All are AWS (Amazon).
5. $ amzn - This is a typo; it's likely referring to Amazon.
6. $ qqq and others, but the main focus is on AMZN.
7. $ act , $ regn , $ slxp etc., again involving Amazon.
8. $ amzn - Focus on Amazon.
9. $ amzn related to sales tax in Florida.
10. $ pru, $ iaci, $ tif, $ amzn - focus on AMZN.
11. $ gapup with multiple companies: PNC, USB, Intc, SBUX, Schwab, Amzn, sina - Focus on Amazon.
12. Regretting investments in VRSN, DRQ, GIS, AMZN - Negative sentiment.
13. Correlations between GOOG and AMZN, FB, LNKD - discussing technical or fundamental factors for AMZN.
14. Goto breakouts on DTV, C A, sci, AMZN - Could be looking at stock performance.

Now, I'll analyze each tweet:

1. ""should you buy , sell or hold $ sbny $ msg $ dov $ amzn visit URL"" – Not much relevant info; probably irrelevant.
2. ""stock watchlist . dont be left behind $ dlph $ stz $ flr $ amzn stock URL"" – No specific info on AMZN.
3. ""amzn : amazon testing handheld grocery ordering device , wsj reports URL"" – No clear info, just mentioning tests and news.
4. ""are you hanging on to $ bac $ pfg $ bby $ amzn must see URL"" – Not much relevant; maybe indicating that AMZN is being looked at.
5. ""rt AT_USER told you so ! amazon 3d smartphone incoming , frags android again ~ itbw for AT_USER $ amzn ~ ~ ~ URL"" – mentions AWS (AMZN) and some tech info, but no sentiment.
6. ""qqq needs to hold 85.00 here imo , if so then ill be looking to grab some $ amzn , other high beta names . spy"" – Positive for AMZN, looking ahead; indicates a positive outlook.
7. ""act , regn , slxp started w / buy , amzn , sfun , twtr upgraded , bita started w / outperform , wday target lowered ."" – This is talking about buying and improving AMZN's performance; positive.
8. ""rt AT_USER be brave , buy growth after pullback : pro URL $ am zn $ bidu $ tsla $ ddd $ ssys $ lnkd $ orcl $ msft $ intc"" – Positive advice, suggesting to go for AMZN despite a possible pullback.
9. ""amzn florida residents will soon pay sales tax on amazon goods URL"" – No relevant info; just mentioning something.
10. ""considering investing in pru , iaci , tif , amzn worth a look URL"" – Positive, looking ahead and considering AMZN.
11. ""gapup - pnc ,usb , intc , sbux , schw , amzn , sina daytrading gaptrading tradingroom stockmarket gapup"" – Positive for AMZN; suggesting that the company is on an upswing.
12. ""regting your investment in vrsn , drq , gis , amzn moneymanagement URL"" – Negative sentiment, regretting a past decision.
13. ""how about those correlations - - goog miss hits am zn fb and lnkd . hmmm..."" – Discusses technical factors; not clear on sentiment.
14. "" isotake breakouts on dtv ca sci am zn goto URL"" – Positive for AMZN as part of a potential breakout.

Now, combining the analyses:

- Positive tweets: 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14
- Negative tweet: 12

Most tweets are positive except one negative. The overall sentiment is likely positive because the majority of relevant tweets are supportive of AMZN, especially on posts that mention buying it or looking ahead. The single negative tweet can be considered a minor dip but doesn't outweigh the positives.

Therefore, the stock price impact seems positive."
2014-04-17,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their likely impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet talks about a URL for the company, so nothing here.
2. The second tweet mentions earnings reports for several companies like GILD, T, MCD, UTX, CMCSA on Tuesdays and others on Thursdays. I don't know what those companies do yet.
3. The third tweet states that Amazon's stock price is 90 points above its Friday trading volume, which suggests a positive news event affecting the price.
4. The fourth tweet asks if AmZN can compete in groceries. This is a business question, not directly about financial performance.
5. The fifth tweet provides earnings info for QGen and WTM on Wednesdays. Earnings report usually signals market interest but isn't always positive or negative.
6. The sixth tweet asks if Amazon can overcome Netflix's content advantage. Again, a business question without financial data.
7. The seventh tweet mentions strikes in Germany affecting AmZN's stock price. Strike news is often negative due to geopolitical events.
8. The eighth tweet suggests buying GlnG instead of AMZN. This could indicate speculative buying but not sure about the stock's performance.
9. The ninth tweet says AmZN's prime is still cost-effective with a $20 increase. If AmZN continues to perform well, this might be positive news.
10. The tenth tweet mentions that Amazon has over 2 million apps on its appstore, which is a significant number and could boost sales.
11. The eleventh tweet questions if AmZN's prime remains cost-effective after a $20 increase. If the price increase doesn't affect profit margins, this could be positive.
12. The twelfth tweet suggests selling stocks like NWL, TSN, LLY, or AMZN due to small-cap stock prices rising. Speculative sell-offs can influence sentiment but aren't direct impact data.
13. The thirteenth tweet talks about AmZN not having debt and big EU banks loading on debts with a 3% yield. Lower interest rates might be positive for AmZN's funding.
14. The fourteenth tweet suggests buying GHLN instead of AMZN based on liquidity. Liquidity issues could impact stock prices but are speculative.
15. The fifteenth tweet is about suggesting buying FDX, HRL, USB, or AMZN with specific percentages. Again, speculative buys affecting sentiment without direct financial data.
16. The sixteenth tweet mentions small-cap stocks hitting a 52-week high due to price increases. This could boost stock prices but isn't directly impacting the stock's value.
17. The seventeenth tweet compares AmZN's price increase with other major tech companies, indicating broader market interest.
18. The eighteenth tweet talks about a meeting where NEXCO's Cavano is presenting on technology disrupting retail, which is a business event that could influence consumer behavior and, by extension, stock prices.
19. The nineteenth tweet provides daily earnings percentages for several companies. Positive news can indicate investor confidence.
20. The twentieth tweet asks if stocks should be held due to overvalued opinions. Over valuing stocks typically signals potential negative sentiment.

Now, combining all these factors: The price increases on AMZN (tweets 3,9,11) and the earnings reports could signal positive news, especially since Amzn is a major player in tech. The speculation about Cavano's presentation might add pressure. The overall impact is a mix of potential positive developments and speculative buybacks."
2014-04-18,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company and then give an overall assessment. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I have to figure out what each tweet is about. The target stock isn't specified here, but looking at the keywords in the tweets like ""qgen,"" ""amzn,"" ""pdx,"" etc., it seems to be related to tech companies that are popular in the market. 

Looking at each tweet:

1. ""are you investing in $ qgen $ clh $ sbac $ am zn"" – This is asking about investment choices, so it's more about investor sentiment and product positioning.
2. ""5 stocks you should be watching $ px $ mdu $ apam $ amzn check out URL"" – This is encouraging people to monitor specific companies for potential changes or trends.
3. ""pennystock research on $ rok $ pld $ am zn $ trla stock URL"" – Another investment tweet, suggesting they're researching stocks and might see price movements.
4. ""avoid mistakes like $ aiv $ jbl $ cyt $ amzn view now URL"" – This is more about avoiding common pitfalls related to the company's products or services.
5. ""$ wri keeping my eye on $ arcc $ cme $ am zn must see URL"" – Again, a tweet encouraging looking out for specific stock movements.

Now, I need to evaluate each tweet's impact. The first three are investment-focused, which could influence market sentiment. They might be leading people to think about the stock price and possibly raising questions or concerns. 

The last two tweets are also investment-oriented but seem more promotional rather than negative. They're encouraging users to stay informed about specific stocks.

Considering all these positive aspects that mention avoiding common issues, promoting caution, and suggesting proactive monitoring, it seems like there's a collective effort from investors looking out for specific risks or trends. This could lead to increased investor confidence in the stock because they see people taking notice of potential changes.

However, without knowing if the company itself is performing well, these tweets might not directly affect the stock price positively or negatively. They mainly relate to broader market sentiment and product performance.

Putting it all together, while there are elements of positive investment promotion, the actual impact on the stock price isn't clear from these tweets alone."
2014-04-19,Positive,"Alright, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I look at the target stock symbol in each tweet. The first tweet mentions $ txn $ lnc $ amzn $ amzn financialnews URL. Hmm, that doesn't seem standard because stock symbols are usually three letters and include a domain name like LNC or AMZN. This seems out of place. Maybe it's a typo? Or perhaps the user made a mistake.

Next, the second tweet is ""earnings news on $ dnr $ alle $ pf $ amzn money URL."" The mention of money makes me think this might be related to a dividend. But I'm not sure if that affects stock price positively or negatively without knowing the company's financial performance.

The third tweet says, ""tech blogger says amazon's 3-d phone is a 'gimbalick' that won't compete with apple or samsung."" Tech companies like Apple and Samsung are major players in their industries. If one tech company's product isn't a competitor, it might attract some investors for innovation reasons. This could potentially increase demand, so there might be some positive sentiment.

But wait, the first tweet was unclear about the stock symbol. That's an issue because without knowing which company we're talking about, it's hard to assess any impact. If I assume that this is a typo and the symbol should be something standard like AMZN or LNC, then I can proceed. However, if it's not, maybe it refers to another company entirely.

Putting it all together, the third tweet has some positive elements about Amazon's product, but without clear context from the first two tweets, I'm making an assumption here. If the stock symbol is indeed AMZN, which stands for Apple Inc., then the third tweet might be pointing towards a positive outcome as well since competitors are less likely to keep their products.

So, overall, combining these thoughts, even though there's some uncertainty from the unclear stock symbol, I lean towards the possibility that Amazon could benefit from the innovation tweet. That would suggest a positive impact on the stock price."
2014-04-20,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I see a list of four tweets. Each seems to be making mentions or recommendations about Amazon stocks. My task is to determine if these signals are positive, neutral, or negative for Amazon. 

Looking at tweet 1: ""earnings news on $ cit $ wynn $ amzn $ qlys must see URL"". The mention of earnings reports could imply that there's some news related to Amazon, maybe about profits or developments in their business. That might influence investor sentiment positively.

Tweet 2: ""some key earnings reports | week of april 21 , 2014 stocks markets trading $ spy $ nflx $ aapl $ fb $ amzn $ bidu $ sbux URL"". This is similar to tweet 1, mentioning earnings on the same day. If there's talk about stock prices or performance, it could be positive because investors might see higher valuations or better expectations.

Tweet 3: ""are you looking for winners like $ gra $ lll $ gt $ amzn stock URL"". The phrase ""winners"" is a common selling tactic in the stock market. It suggests that the companies are expected to perform well, which could indicate positive news for Amazon's stock price.

Tweet 4: ""rt AT_USER why amazon should acquire sears : URL ( via AT_USER $ shld $ amzn"". This tweet is more promotional, encouraging Amazon to consider acquiring another company, Sears. Acquisition activities can often be seen as a signal of growth potential or strategic moves by the company, which might boost stock price positively.

Now, summarizing each tweet's impact:

1. Earnings reports: Positive news about their performance.
2. Earnings on the same day: Indicates market reaction to news.
3. Looking for winners: Suggesting potential buy-in from investors.
4. Promotional acquisition: Encourages strategic moves, which can be a good signal.

All four tweets are providing information that could influence investor sentiment positively. The mention of earnings and potential acquisitions might indicate improved business outlook or growth prospects. Therefore, the overall sentiment is positive for Amazon's stock price."
2014-04-21,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of the given company. The user provided a list of nine tweets, each with different factors and sentiments. My task is to process each tweet and decide whether it contributes positively, neutrally, or negatively to the overall sentiment.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. It looks like most of them are related to Amazon (AMZN) or its competitors. For example, one tweet mentions AMZN and others talk about trends in other companies related to AMZN's stock. So, all tweets can be considered relevant to AMZN.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one and assess the positive, negative, or neutral factors they present.

1. "" todays stocks you should be watching $ dbd $ cvi $ payx $ amzn try this URL"" – This seems like a welcome message encouraging viewers to watch these stocks, which isn't directly related to AMZN's performance. So, I think this is neutral because it doesn't mention any positive or negative news about AMZN.

2. "" netflix ceo reed hastings on amazon prime : "" i'm a member . "" $ amzn $ nflx URL"" – This tweet mentions Netflix (NFLX) and their CEO talking about Amazon Prime. It doesn't provide any direct info on AMZN, so it's probably neutral.

3. "" insider trading alerts on $ bio $ alle $ amzn $ ci personalfinance URL"" – Again, this is unrelated to AMZN, just mentioning other stocks. So, neutral.

4. "" stock market reports on stocks like $ bwa $ gpor $ orcl $ amzn personalfinance URL"" – Talks about upcoming reports but not specific to AMZN. Neutral.

5. "" $ amzn analyst : amazon unlikely to provide ‘ strategy road map ’ URL"" – The tweet implies that Amazon's analysts might not provide a strategy roadmap, which could affect investor sentiment towards AMZN. This seems like an indicator that AMZN is undervalued and may face some negative news, so this might be a negative factor.

6. "" stocks you migh want to sell $ ntrs $ hhc $ pf $ amzn equity URL"" – While talking about selling shares, it's speculative and doesn't provide positive or negative information on AMZN itself. Neutral.

7. "" google , amazon may join xiaomi , micromax in leading smartphone prices to the basement URL"" – This is a bit ambiguous but suggests that AMZN might see increased competition from other brands, which could be seen as good news for AMZN's market position, potentially boosting sentiment. So this might be positive.

8. "" $ amzn : earnings preview : netflix shares trading up 3 % since last earnings rep ... URL"" – This directly states that Netflix shares are trading up because of AMZN's earnings. Positive information about the company's performance, so this is a positive factor.

9. "" rt AT_USER some key earnings reports | this week stocks markets trading $ spy $ nflx $ aapl $ fb $ amzn $ bidu $ sbux URL"" – Similar to tweet 8, mentions earnings but doesn't provide details on AMZN specifically. Neutral information about earnings might indicate positive or negative trends.

Now, I need to combine these factors. There are both positive and negative points. The most significant factor here is the earnings preview where Netflix shares go up due to AMZN's performance. This shows that AMZN is doing well enough for investors, which could be a good sign. However, there are mentions of increased competition in smartphones, which might not be as directly tied to AMZN but could affect its overall market position.

Considering all these points, the positive sentiment from Netflix's earnings is likely to have a more significant impact on AMZN than the smartphone price increase. Therefore, the overall sentiment should lean towards [Positive]."
2014-04-22,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze each tweet provided and determine their impact on the stock price of Amzn.com. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. **Tweet 1**: ""do you need stock research on $ etn $ csx $ mb $ amzn money URL"" - It's about researching for stock, which is generally positive but might not significantly affect the market.
2. **Tweet 2**: ""rt AT_USER $ fb , $ goog , and $ am zn aside ; the market for unmanned aerial vehicles will be huge ! drones URL."" This seems to attract investors interested in UAVs, a sector that's growing. Positive sentiment likely.
3. **Tweet 3**: ""do you need stock research on $ xyl $ vrsn $ amzn $ rt liquidity URL"" - Inquire about stock info and focus on liquidity. Positive because it helps find valuations.
4. **Tweet 4**: ""what happened to $ amzn 400 call or $ nflx 395 call . are they worthless yet ? call sellers laugh all the way to the bank."" Trading calls indicates uncertainty, so negative sentiment as investors might be concerned about price changes.
5. **Tweet 5**: ""rt AT_USER netflix , amazon prime can co-exist . ' it's not a zero-sum game , ' says reed hastings $ nflx $ amzn URL"" - This suggests a positive interaction between two companies, which is generally good for the market.
6. **Tweet 6**: ""$ amzn : netflix , adding customers and profits , raises prices URL."" Adds more revenue streams, so positive impact on growth.
7. **Tweet 7**: ""buying or selling ? $ low $ dst $ cbt $ am zn nse URL"" - Inquiring about buying/selling could be neutral if not enough info is provided.
8. **Tweet 8**: ""$ smh day low click here : URL also see : $ bhp $ smvi $ myec $ amzn ~"" This link seems to redirect, but the content isn't clear. Could be positive or negative depending on context.
9. **Tweet 9**: ""$ amzn will target's subscription box succeed in crowded marketplace ? URL."" Subscriptions are popular and can boost revenue, which is positive.
10. **Tweet 10**: ""AT_USER rt marc faber : us markets in dangerous overpriced territory $ aapl nexttrade stocks $ pcln $ am zn $ nflx $ goog $ tsla $ fb $ bbry $ gld $ qqq"" This seems negative because it suggests markets are overvalued, leading to potential sell-offs.
11. **Tweet 11**: ""find out the latest on $ xlnx $ pg $ neu $ amzn try this URL"" - Inquiring about stock info without context might be neutral or slightly positive if they're looking for valuations.
12. **Tweet 12**: ""todays stocks you should be watching $ pki $ cbt $ vrsk $ am zn must see URL"" - Inquiring about upcoming trades and valuations, which could influence sentiment positively.
13. **Tweet 13**: ""rt $ aapl becomes computer manufacturing company . p / t 525 nexttrade stocks $ pcln $ am zn $ nflx $ goog $ tsla $ fb $ bbry $ gld $ qqq"" This is about the performance of a major tech company, which can impact the market positively.
14. **Tweet 14**: ""$ awk what's going on with $ cpt $ tmo $ am zn personalfinance URL"" - No context here; could be neutral or speculative.
15. **Tweet 15**: ""$ amzn buy signal URL"" - Inquiring about buying signals might suggest some interest, but not enough info yet.
16. **Tweet 16**: ""looking for more info on $ csl $ tkr $ har $ am zn overvalued URL"" - Inquiries without context could be neutral or slightly positive if related to valuations.
17. **Tweet 17**: ""$ amzn market cap click here : URL also see : $ argt $ clf $ mine $ t ~"" The link is unclear, but mentions market cap, which can affect sentiment positively.
18. **Tweet 18**: ""stocks i'm keeping my eye on ... should you ? $ lm $ mo $ syy $ am zn economy URL"" - Inquiries without context could be neutral or slightly negative if expecting a downturn.
19. **Tweet 19**: ""$ should you buy , sell or hold $ gra $ cfx $ esrx $ amzn overvalued URL"" - Inquiring about trading decisions, which might not significantly impact the stock price.

After evaluating each tweet, I notice some positive tweets like 2, 4 (indicated by calls), 5, 6, 9, 13, and 17. There are negative tweets like 10 and 18. The sentiment is a mix of mixed with some strong positives and one or two negatives. Without more context from the other tweets, it's challenging to gauge the overall trend, but there's evidence that Amzn.com might be in a mixed market environment."
2014-04-23,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price.

First, I'll go through each tweet one by one to identify positive (P) or negative (N) factors for Amazon. 

1. The first tweet is about retrieving some symbol names, which doesn't seem relevant.
2. The second mentions $ amzn adding hbo for prime members, but since there's no context of sentiment, I can't assess it yet.
3. The third tweet talks about Netflix dropping 5% and Newton's dropping by 6%. There's a mention of hBO streaming older shows. The stock price seems to drop, so that might be negative.
4. The fourth is the same as tweet three, just rephrased, but no sentiment assessment yet.
5. Tweet five provides information about implied volatility but doesn't give any insight into whether Amazon's stock is up or down.
6. Tweets six and seven are about amzn being hit by strikes in Germany and potential merger opportunities. The user says it's a key site for amzn. This could suggest a shift in the company, which might affect sentiment negatively because of the increased competition or potential economic impacts.
7. Tweet eight asks if I'm putting money in dva, ohi, avi, or amzn. Since there's no information on how this relates to Amazon's stock performance, it's hard to assess.
8. Tweet nine talks about AMZN's phone app being important for its future, but again, without context on Amazon's performance, I can't tell.
9. Tweets ten mentions insider trading, which could indicate potential news that might cause investors to sell or worry about losses. This is a red flag for negative sentiment.
10. Tweet eleven discusses selling stocks based on the 'nly' symbol, but no info on amzn performance.
11. Tweet twelve asks if I should get more info on wmb, stl, ftr, or amzn's personal finance. No connection to stock market impact here.
12. Tweet thirteen is a meta comment about possible mergers on amzn and nly, but again, no indication of stock performance.
13. Tweet fourteen talks about Facebook's leadership affecting earnings. This could show increased competition, which might lead to lower stock prices as consumers seek alternatives.
14. Tweet fifteen continues the negative trend with hbo's media mentions and amzn dropping 6%. This clearly indicates decreased stock price because of their losses.
15. Tweet sixteen is similar to tweet five but in German context; no sentiment yet.
16. Tweet seventeen talks about omc, vmc, pfe, which are unrelated, so can't assess impact on amzn's performance.
17. Tweet eighteen mentions wedbush and a challenge in hbo-hwax relationship, again, not relevant to amzn stock.
18. Tweet nineteen is aboutcantor's deal but no information on amzn's performance.

So, looking at all these tweets, the key negative ones are 5,6,7,9,10,12,13, and 14. These all point towards decreased profits or potential competition from AMZN. Additionally, tweets 13 and 14 suggest that AMZN's future might be affected by mergers or partnerships, which could impact their stock price negatively. The overall sentiment is a mix of possible increases in competition (positive) but also significant drops and shifts (negative). It seems there are enough negative cues to make me lean towards a Negative overall impact on Amazon's stock."
2014-04-24,Negative,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. First, let me go through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions avoiding mistakes like certain URLs but doesn't seem relevant to Amazon's performance.
2. The second tweet talks about Amazon's ability to remain immune from nature's pullback, which might affect investor sentiment.
3. Third tweet says they're dropping a scooping opportunity not final, which could be positive for Amazon if it gains attention.
4. Fourth mentions technical comments ahead of earnings but doesn't provide details on whether that affects Amazon directly.
5. Fifth tweet reports $ amzn's higher-than-expected revenue, which is good news and might boost the stock.
6. Sixth tweet talks about a buying opportunity from Topknot, which could mean selling or increasing holdings.
7. Seventh mentions grabbing rights to older HBO shows, which might affect demand and thus stock price.
8. Eighth tweets about equity earnings calls but doesn't provide info on what those earnings are like.
9. Ninth tweet says Amazon's quarterly revenue is lower than the consensus estimate, which could be a warning sign for future performance.
10. Tenth tweet shares higher-than-expected revenue, reinforcing positive news about Amazon.
11. Eleventh tweet mentions a loss next quarter versus the current consensus, which might signal instability in the company.
12. Twelfth tweet is about an earnings call with live updates, providing important information that could influence market sentiment.
13. Thirteenth says AMZN will have 0.347 or more losses next quarter, indicating a possible downward trend.
14. Fourth tweet talks about July and January puts but doesn't specify if they're performing well.
15. Fifteenth tweet is a placeholder with no relevant info.
16. Twentieth tweet discusses research on pennystock (PEN) for Amazon, which could be positive or negative depending on the sector.
17. Twenty-first tweet mentions research on stocks like HTR, GWR, ECL, but nothing specific about AMZN.
18. Twentieth tweet shares a bullish vertical sentiment towards AMZN's April earnings report.
19. Twenty-second tweet talks about Facebook concerns regarding investor sentiment.
20. Twenty-third tweet mentions $ ipg and other cryptocurrencies affecting Amazon stock.
21. Twenty-fourth tweet is a placeholder for a buy/sell instruction for SPY, GLW, TJX stocks.
22. Twenty-fifth tweet discusses earnings outlook on AMZN with a video featuring Facebook's CEO.
23. Sixth tweet reports on earnings info from Reg and Mdrx.
24. Twenty-sixth tweet mentions expectations about the one-day move in Amazon stock.
25. Twenty-seventh tweet asks whether I should sell certain stocks like IPG, CIM, NCO based on AWS pricing.
26. Twenty-eighth tweet is a placeholder with no relevant information.
27. Twentyninth tweet reports street estimates for Amazon's revenues and sales growth.
28. Thirtieth tweet discusses expectations about Amazon stock performance.

Now, I need to categorize each tweet into positive, negative, or neutral factors. Then assess the overall sentiment by looking at trends in positive tweets versus negative ones.

Positive tweets include mentions of revenue growth, specific stock performance indicators like EPS and sales figures (tweets 10-24), expectations about earnings (tweets 26, 33), opinions on future performance (tweets 8,17,18,20). Negative tweets cover things like price concerns, potential losses next quarter (tweets 11,15), potential stock sales or holdings (tweets 1,3,4,5,7), concerns about weather affecting profits (tweet 6), research mentions (tweets 19-21,28), and specific earnings reports from the company (tweets 25,26). The overall sentiment is positive if there are more positive tweets than negatives.

Looking at each tweet, I see a mix of positive and negative factors. Positive tweets indicate good news, while some have concerns about price or potential losses. Negative tweets show different reactions to specific events."
2014-04-25,Negative,"Alright, I'm trying to analyze the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price based on the provided rules. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. **Identify Target Stock**: The target is AMZN.
2. **Tweet-by-Tweet Analysis**:
   - Tweets 3-7: These seem to provide background or additional info about the market, which doesn't directly impact Amazon's stock.
   - Tweets 8: This one mentions that AMZN dropped 10%, so there's a negative immediate effect on sentiment.
   - Tweets 9 and 25 mention specific drops in other stocks due to earnings but don't target AMZN. So maybe neutral overall, unless they influence AMZN indirectly.
   - Tweets 16 and 24 talk about stock performance relative to others, which might show market trends without direct AMZN impact.
   - Tweets 27-39 are more speculative and seem unrelated or speculative. They don't directly mention AMZN's performance.
   - Tweets 30-38 discuss financials and earnings but again, not targeting AMZN specifically.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - tweet 8: Negative ( Amazon drops)
   - tweets 9-14: Provide information about other companies affecting the market, which could indicate a broader market trend.
   - tweets 25-26 discuss economic factors causing AMZN's drop.
   - The rest of the tweets don't mention AMZN directly.

4. **Overall Sentiment Summary**: Considering all the tweets, most are either background info or mentions of stock performance relative to others. There are no direct tweets about Amazon's performance yet or any that significantly influence AMZN. Therefore, it seems like there's a lack of direct positive or negative sentiment towards AMZN based on these tweets.

5. **Conclusion**: Since all the tweets focus on external factors affecting other stocks or market trends without mentioning AMZN directly or indicating strong support/opposition for the stock, the overall impact is neutral."
2014-04-26,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by identifying each tweet.

1. ** stocks i'm keeping my eye on ... should you ? $ cl $ emc $ amzn financialnews URL**
   - This seems like a buy or hold message, so positive sentiment.

2. ** rt AT_USER congrats to those getting the fuck out of $ amzn over $ 300 ...
   - The user is congratulating those losing the sale, which could be negative due to potential loss.

3. ** $ br get great research on stocks $ amzn $ mlm $ dust financial URL
   - Positive investment in Amazon's future, likely positive sentiment.

4. ** making sense of the crash in amazon stock URL 
   - The user is questioning the crash, so maybe negative if they think it's overvalued or the situation isn't good.

5. ** stock market reports you need on $ apol $ ocn $ cmp $ amzn investing URL
   - This is a report request, which could be neutral if the user is waiting for information.

6. ** top stocks today . find out why . $ alr $ seic $ aapl $ amzn goto URL
   - Inquiring about reasons to invest in Amazon's top stocks, positive as it's seeking value.

   - Negative due to regret for previous investments.

8. ** stocks you might want to hold onto $ fls $ idxx $ maa $ amzn financial URL
   - Positive if it's about maintaining a portfolio, which is neutral.

9. ** do you think you should hold $ gt $ idxx $ kex $ amzn investing URL 
   - Neutral as the question is about decision-making rather than sentiment on stock.

10. ** insider trading updates on $ hsy $ tho $ unh $ amzn wealthmanagement URL
    - Negative if there are hints of manipulation, affecting investor trust.

11. ** rt AT_USER $ amzn down 25 percent in 2014 ... thats not small potatoes or shekels . dropping like a broken drone .
    - The tweet is negative because it's about a decline that might indicate a trend issue or poor decisions.

12. ** rt AT_USER how bad has the sell-off in amazon been ? it actually has a p / e now . $ amzn
    - Positive if Amazon is improving, but could be misleading if the report isn't accurate.

13. ** did you lose money on $ jcp $ kors $ cwh $ amzn economy URL
    - Negative due to loss of investments in other companies.

14. ** amzn close date = apr -25-2014 open = 316.25 high = 316.49 low = 302.71 close = 303.83 volume = 16186700 URL
    - Factually, but no sentiment on the stock price itself.

15. ** is it breakout time on $ ori $ cdns $ crs $ amzn investing URL
    - Neutral as a question about market conditions without providing info.

16. ** ebay top performing stocks today $ wmt $ hban $ amzn newsletter URL
    - Positive because the user is asking about potential investments, which could boost Amazon's audience.

17. **ouch . $ amzn plunge cut the value of bezos ’ stake in the company by nearly $ 2.8 billion in just one day .
    - Negative if the impact on Amazon's core operations is too significant to ignore.

18. ** stock market reports you need on $ t $ shw $ mrk $ amzn equity URL
    - Factually, but no direct impact on price unless it affects investor views.

19. ** todays stocks you should be watching $ swks $ l $ fnf $ amzn liquidity URL
    - Positive for diversification, so neutral.

20. ** earnings news on $ cyt $ xel $ hes $ amzn personalfinance URL
    - No information about price impact unless earnings are bad, which isn't mentioned.

So overall, some tweets are positive (buying, inquiring, holding), others are negative or neutral. The main factors are Amazon's financial health, core operations, and market trends."
2014-04-27,Negative,"Alright, let's see what I need to do here. So, the task is to analyze these tweets and determine if they're going to be positive, neutral, or negative for a company stock. The user provided seven tweets with specific stocks mentioned in each.

First, I'll start by understanding each tweet individually. Let me go through them one by one.

1. "" $ vrsn it could be breaktout time on $ amzn $ gxp $ goog economy URL"" – Okay, this seems like a negative tweet because they're predicting something bad about the economy affecting AMZN, GXP, and GOOGL. Negative factors usually lead to selling pressure and a downward trend.

2. "" bankruptcy is next . strong sell rating on $ jcp and $ . 99 price target due to j . c . penney's bad financial state getting worse . $ m $ amzn $ ebay"" – This one looks like it's about the company's financial health, specifically focusing on JCP and the fact that JCP pensney had a bad state. This could indicate concern about default or bankruptcy, which might lead to negative sentiment.

3. ""$ orly do you think you should hold $ ago $ amat $ amzn try this URL"" – The user is questioning if they should hold shares of ORLY, AGOMA, and AMZN. If they're worried about the stock performance, that could be seen as negative for investors looking to buy.

4. ""$ bre get the latest on $ brcm $ mchp $ amzn research URL"" – This tweet is more about getting information about BRCM and MCHP stocks related to AMZN. If there's a report or analysis about these, it might affect investor expectations, but without specifics, it's hard to tell if positive or negative.

5. ""Don't want to lose like you did with $ dri $ val $ cms $ amzn try this URL"" – This is a selling tweet suggesting that losing isn't good and possibly implying potential for price drops, leading to a negative impact on the stock.

6. ""Are you thinking of selling $ mpc $ duk $ luk $ amzn click URL"" – Again, this seems like a sell offer. If they're selling their AMZN shares, it's likely to increase demand, pushing up prices and positive sentiment.

7. "". AT_USER isn't a startup . should it stop acting like one ? URL $ amzn"" – This tweet is about whether the user (AT_USER) acts like a startup and if it's appropriate. While not directly related to AMZN stock performance, mentioning users or companies could influence investor behavior. If there's concern that such behavior isn't typical, that might be seen as negative by investors.

Now, combining these observations: The first tweet is very negative about economic factors. The second has financial concerns from JCP pensney. Third is selling advice. Fourth and fifth are research-oriented. Sixth is a sell offer. Seventh involves user behavior about the company.

Overall, it seems like there's some selling pressure because of tweets 5 and 6 suggesting potential price drops or increases. But tweet 1 clearly points to negative economic news. Twitter can be volatile, so these signals could have mixed effects.

Considering all factors—positive from market trends, but negative news from specific sectors—I think the overall sentiment leans towards a mix rather than purely positive or negative. However, some selling offers and immediate concerns make it look like there's potential for negative impact."
2014-04-28,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. First, I'll go through each tweet one by one.

Looking at tweet 1, it mentions that New York’s tech scene is still starting up, which might suggest they are gaining momentum, so maybe a positive outlook. However, I don't have any data or specific numbers here to quantify this.

tweet 2 talks about daily volume exceeding in under 30 minutes and ignoring signs of big boys leaving. This could mean that there's high activity, but without knowing if the company is undervalued or overvalued, it's hard to gauge sentiment. Maybe a bit of positive, but I'm not sure.

tweet 3 discusses small-cap stocks being strong highs at $52-58 and mentions other companies like Kmx, CRM, Amzn, etc. If these are underpriced compared to their peers, that could be a positive sign for Amazon's stock.

tweet 4 is about trading on Wallstreet, asking if I should hold some stocks. This seems more like a call to action rather than a tweet with a strong sentiment towards the stock.

tweet 5 talks about selling positions because of Apple fees, which might indicate uncertainty or fear around future earnings, so that could be negative.

tweet 6 mentions overpricing by 99.50 points on valuations and expects strong sell on valuations next trades. Overpriced companies can sometimes attract investors because they offer better returns relative to their cost, which is a positive signal.

tweet 7 asks for research on HCBK stock, so this could be related to potential buy signals but without specifics, it's speculative.

tweet 8 talks about alibaba behind Google and Facebook among internet companies. If the company is seen as underpriced compared to competitors, that might suggest an upward trend.

tweet 9 discusses Amazon avoiding Apple fees with a new app, which could affect their financial performance, potentially causing negative sentiment if investors worry about future earnings.

tweet 10 mentions setting up an algo for today's trading at a specific time. This seems like a technical action rather than a tweet with positive or negative sentiment towards the stock.

tweet 11 classifies stockmarket winners and losers based on certain companies, which doesn't directly relate to Amazon's performance.

tweet 12 asks about the latest on AGN, AVT, CAB, AMZN. This could be another tweet that provides information but without specific analysis or data, it's hard to assess.

tweet 13 discusses earnings news for Endp, Modelz, Dnkn, and Amzn, which might indicate future performance of Amazon if they're positive.

Putting this all together: Some tweets are about current market conditions (2,3,6), sentiment on valuations (4,7,8), but others talk about actions like selling positions or technical setups. There's some mention of earnings reports, which could influence stock prices. The overall tone is a mix of positive thoughts from valuations and speculative calls, while others are more action-oriented without clear sentiment.

However, given the uncertainty around earnings and the lack of concrete data on valuations relative to competitors, it's hard to determine a strong overall sentiment. It seems like there's some optimism based on valuation metrics but also some caution with Apple-related issues."
2014-04-29,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets about a company's stock price based on their impact. Let me break it down step by step.

First, from the tweet list provided, I can extract the stock symbol which is AMZN (Amazon). So, the focus is on Amazon.

Now, looking at each tweet one by one:

1. The first tweet says investors are increasingly bearish on potential revenue boosters like Yelp and Amazon. This suggests a negative sentiment.
2. The second tweet mentions AMZN continuing its focus, but it's not very informative about any specific impact on the stock price.
3. The third tweet is upbeat with bibliophiles celebrating a bookbub platform helping readers find e-book deals via Amazon. This indicates positive information but might be seen as speculative or unrelated to the stock directly.
4. The fourth tweet talks about upcoming market reports, which could provide insights into Amazon's future performance, indicating some interest in potential changes in the industry.
5. The fifth tweet advises holding onto stocks based on specific factors, again touching on general market considerations without direct info on AMZN.
6. The sixth tweet discusses research on small-cap stocks and their highs, which might show broader investment sentiment but not directly impacting AMZN yet.
7. The seventh tweet provides earnings data for Amazon, which could influence investor confidence. Positive earnings might lead to positive stock reactions.
8. The eighth tweet mentions small-cap stocks making high volumes, indicating interest in specific segments of the market without a clear connection to AMZN.
9. The ninth tweet discusses Google's large expenditures and views them as costs to be capitalized, which is a business concern but not directly affecting Amazon.

Now, considering the factors: positive tweets are 7,4,5,8 (based on the given examples). Negative is tweet 1. The rest are neutral or speculative without clear impact.

The overall sentiment would be influenced by the number of positive and negative factors. Since there are more positive tweets indicating some interest in Amazon's future through earnings data, it leans towards a Positive overall sentiment."
2014-04-30,Negative,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of Amazon (AMZN). Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet says ""super 6 momentum stocks ? they're sinking fast : URL $ amzn $ fb $ lnkd $ nflx $ crm $ twtr"". It mentions six momentum stocks that are falling fast, but I don't have the stock symbol from this tweet. Maybe it's a placeholder for something else.

2. The second tweet is ""bad investments like got you down $ mhk $ pcar $ sre $ amzn newsletter URL"". Here, AMZN is mentioned as part of a newsletter. The words ""bad investments"" and ""down"" indicate potential loss. A negative sentiment.

3. The third tweet: ""looking for research on $ sfg $ ebay $ aa $ amzn newsletter URL"". Again, AMZN is in the list, so this tweet might be suggesting research or info about AMZN. It's a positive note because it's looking for something related to Amazon, which could boost sentiment.

4. The fourth tweet: ""amzn hot or not : which tech ceos are on the outs with investors URL"". This seems speculative. ""Hot"" suggests potential growth, but without specifics, it's hard to say if it's positive or negative about AMZN itself.

5. The fifth tweet: ""whats going on with $ chs $ dg $ axs $ amzn visit URL"". Chs, dg, axs are all technology terms. This is vague and could be indicating a tech-related event, which might affect AMZN but not directly as I don't know the company's news.

6. The sixth tweet: ""dd should you buy $ cbs $ cbsh $ amzn check out URL"". Again, mentions AmZN and another company, suggesting a possible positive note about Amzn.

7. The seventh tweet is just a number without a stock symbol, so I can't extract the target stock.

8. The eighth tweet: ""sick and tired of losing money on $ joe $ etfc $ azo $ amzn visit URL"". Loss of money could be negative if it affects AMZN's fundamentals or revenue. But losing money is more about profitability than a direct impact on the stock price unless there are specific factors mentioned.

9. The ninth tweet: ""grpn is going to surprise . with getaways and coupons and goods . unlike $ amzn they have no downside risk "". This seems positive because it mentions that AMZN doesn't have downside risk, which could be seen as a confidence boost for the stock price.

10. The tenth tweet: ""inc . ( $ amzn ) rising quickly ! currently priced at 303.6816 $."". This directly states that AMZN is rising and giving its current price, which is positive because it's showing a trend towards growth.

11. The eleventh tweet: ""great pennystock research $ orcl $ spls $ amzn $ goog money URL"". Similar to the third tweet, this seems like someone is researching or suggesting something about AMZN, hence a positive note.

12. The twelfth tweet: ""amzn : heres why facebook will succeed with drones URL"". Again, mentions Facebook and mentioning other tech companies but not necessarily related to Amazon's stock price directly.

Now, considering each tweet:
- Negative tweets: 2,8,9
- Positive tweets:3,7,10,11

There are both negative and positive notes. Some tweets mention AmZN in contexts that could indicate good or bad news about it (like a newsletter mentioning something). However, most of them are speculative or related to other tech companies.

The overall sentiment is mixed. The positive tweets suggest some optimism about AMZN's potential, while the negatives indicate concerns. Without specific information on earnings, growth prospects, or any direct impact factors, it's hard to conclude a strong positive or negative trend."
2014-05-01,Negative,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by breaking down each step based on the user's instructions.

First, the process involves identifying the target stock symbol from the tweets. Then, I need to look at each tweet individually to separate positive and negative factors. After that, I assess the sentiment of each tweet regarding investor sentiment towards Amazon. Finally, I combine these sentiments to get an overall conclusion. The output should be one of three tags: [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative].

Looking at the provided tweets, they all seem to talk about stock research, upcoming events, and possibly insider trading or relevant news related to Amazon (AMZN). There's no specific mention of a target stock symbol here, so I might need to infer it from common keywords. But without knowing the exact stock name, I can only make assumptions based on context.

Each tweet seems to be discussing various topics like upcoming events, research reports, and market trends. For example, some tweets talk about AMZN making specific highs or lows, while others mention upcoming events like ""breakout time"" or mentions of specific companies (like PPG, AT&T) that might influence Amazon's stock.

Looking at the sentiment analysis, most tweets seem neutral because they're discussing research reports and current market trends without extreme statements. For instance, tweet 2 says ""$ urs $ biib $ n $ amzn view now URL"" which doesn't give much context on positive or negative emotions. Similarly, some tweets like ""regis philbin sours on apple , looks to amazon URL via AT_USER"" might be indicating investor reactions, but without specific data on how users feel, it's hard to categorize as positive or negative.

However, considering the collective sentiment of these 13 tweets—each is either discussing current events or research that could affect Amazon. There are no explicit positive statements about the company itself or upcoming significant events. Most seem more about external factors or market trends rather than the company's fundamentals or strategic moves. 

Therefore, when combining all the sentiments, I don't see a clear overall trend towards positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. It seems like the tweets are focusing on current events and research that could impact Amazon without a dominant perspective from positive or negative emotions."
2014-05-02,Positive,"Alright, I need to figure out how to assess the impact of these tweets on the stock price of Amsco (AMZN) based on their sentiment analysis. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, for each tweet, I should identify if there's a positive or negative factor mentioned. Then, determine if the sentiment is overall positive, neutral, or negative. After that, combine these to decide the stock's overall impact.

Starting with tweet 1: "" $ tfx small-cap stocks making 52 - wk highs $ kmx $ rovi $ amzn must see URL"". Here, it mentions TFX and RVOI stocks going high, so positive factors like strong earnings or performance. The link seems clickable, which could be a sign of interest or potential for an upgrade.

Tweet 2: "" todays stocks you should watch $ phm $ hot $ ntap $ amzn nse rate_limit_exceeded"". This one talks about monitoring stock prices and the NSE limit being exceeded. A high volume might indicate investor focus on risk management, which could affect sentiment negatively if others are worried about it.

Tweet 3: "" $ amzn centurylink makes a bold cloud move against you-know-who URL"". It mentions the cloud moving in a way that affects users of CenturyLink. The link suggests a political or regulatory issue, which might cause concerns among investors, leading to negative sentiment.

Tweet 4: "" latest earnings info on $ zts $ rax $ glng $ amzn financialnews URL"". Here, it's talking about earnings reports, so positive factors like strong earnings could increase investor confidence and thus boost the stock price.

Tweet 5: "" seeking the next stock like $ awh $ rax $ lng $ amzn wealthmanagement URL"". This is about finding the best stock for wealth management. Positive because it indicates potential growth areas or opportunities in the financial sector, which can positively impact Amsco's stock.

Tweet 6: "" options investor newsletter issue 117 URL $ znga $ bbry $ tsla $ nq $ amzn $ qid $ hlf $ bwa $ plug"". It talks about an options newsletter issue. While this could lead to increased volatility, the mention of a high number of stocks and potential for market reactions might suggest mixed sentiment depending on how it impacts investor confidence.

Tweet 7: "" $ isca are you bullish on these stocks $ mbi $ see $ amzn liquidity URL"". It's about user sentiment towards Amsco's liquidity. Positive because liquidity issues can affect stock performance, so this adds to the positive factors.

Tweet 8: "" aapl 593.10 +0.3 % $ fb 61.02 -0.2 % $ amzn 306.85 -0.3 % $ yhoo 36.44 -0.2 % $ lnkd 155.43 -3.6 % $ twtr 39.38 +0.74 % $ king 17.08 -1.3 %"". This tweet lists the prices of several stocks, with some going up and others down. The combination of positive and negative movements might indicate mixed sentiment overall.

Tweet 9: "" whats going on with $ boh $ jbht $ lo $ amzn personalfinance URL"". It's about a tech topic related to personal finance. Positive because it taps into current trends, potentially influencing investor behavior towards Amsco's stock performance.

Lastly, tweet 10: "" stocks i'm keeping my eye on ... should you ? $ vmi $ aapl $ amzn $ bwp try this URL"". This seems like a query encouraging investors to follow certain companies. Positive because it signals increased interest in specific stocks, which can boost the overall sentiment towards Amsco.

Now, let's tally the factors. Positive tweets include TFX, RVOI, liquidity (tweet 7), financial performance (tweet 4), earnings (tweet 5), personalfinance trends (tweet 9), and the query (tweet 10). Negative tweets are phm, rate_limit_exceeded, cloud move (tweet 3), options newsletter issue (tweet 6).

Positive factors outnumber negative ones. The stock price is likely to rise because of strong earnings, positive news about liquidity, and user interest in personal finance. However, the options newsletter could cause some concern, but overall sentiment leans towards positive."
2014-05-03,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. I'm not entirely sure about all the nuances here, but I'll go through each tweet step by step.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Let's see:

1. ""5 stocks you should be watching $ txn $ tdc $ klac $ amzn nasdaq URL"" — Hmm, this one has a bunch of company names and URLs. I'm not sure which one is being referred to here.
2. ""best pennystock research $ l $ tjx $ krft $ amzn check out URL"" Again, multiple companies involved. Not clear on the target stock.
3. ""bad invesments like got you down $ apc $ am znm pdm gain visit URL"" This tweet talks about investments being bad and mentions several stocks: APC, AMZN, NDM, GAIN. It uses a lot of negative language and mentions URLs which I don't recognize as stock symbols.
4. ""$ stt stocks you might want to buy $ spn $ ndaq amzn goto URL"" Several companies here: STT, SPN, NDAY, GOZY. Again, multiple stocks involved without clear target.
5. ""$ alle do you think you should hold $ pten wtw am zn visit URL"" This tweet is about holding a stock (PENTY) and mentions several others: PTEN, WTW, AMZN. It's more positive in tone but again with multiple companies mentioned.
6. ""latest information on stocks like de bms cmg am zn must have url"" Multiple stock names here: DE, BMS, CMG, AZN. No specific target stock.
7. ""small-cap stocks breaking 52 - wk high prices $ mur cb fbhs am zn research url"" Small-cap stocks breaking higher — so perhaps looking at small-cap companies? But the target isn't clear from this tweet.
8. ""$ ebay stock market reports on stocks like rhi nwsa am zw financialnews url"" Similar to others, multiple stocks mentioned without a specific target.

Now that I have all these, it's a bit confusing because each tweet is talking about different stocks and URLs which are not clearly identifying the target company. This makes it hard to determine exactly what stock we're looking at for analysis. Without knowing the exact target stock, it's difficult to assess its impact on the future price.

I think the main issue here is that while some tweets focus on positive aspects like small-cap stocks breaking high or indicating a good market overview, others are more negative about investments and personal experiences with other companies. Since I don't have a specific target stock, I can't determine if these tweets will positively or negatively affect the price of any particular stock.

Maybe there's an assumption that all these stocks are related or perhaps one is being targeted for analysis collectively. If they're all part of a larger market analysis or survey, it might influence investor sentiment collectively rather than individual stocks. However, without knowing which stock is under scrutiny, I can't make a precise assessment.

In the end, without clear direction or specific target stock information, it's challenging to conclude whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative in their impact on any particular company's stock price."
2014-05-04,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of Amazon. Let's break it down step by step.

First, each tweet has factors and a URL. The target stock is Amazon (AMZN). The task is to assess whether each tweet affects AMZN positively, neutrally, or negatively.

1. **First Tweet**: ""are you looking for winners like $ tap $ nsm $ fdx $ amzn wallstreet URL"". This seems more like an investment strategy or a survey rather than directly influencing stock price. It's just asking if people are interested in AMZN but not necessarily affecting its performance.

2. **Second Tweet**: ""are you bullish on these stocks $ aon $ hlf $ foxa $ amzn check out URL"". This is clearly a call to action, encouraging someone to consider AMZN for bullish positions. It's positive as it aligns with the target stock but is more of an outreach than a direct impact.

3. **Third Tweet**: ""looking for the next winners like $ ov $ pll $ swk $ amzn view now URL"". Similar to the first one, this seems like another survey or investment strategy. It doesn't directly mention AMZN and isn't suggesting an action that would affect its price.

4. **Fourth Tweet**: ""$ amzn high open interest range is 290.00 to 310.00 for option expiration 05/09 / 2014 . URL"". This tweet provides a specific data point about AMZN's open interest. It mentions the range and dates, but it doesn't state whether this affects the stock price positively or negatively. Maybe indicating that the company is doing well or not? But without more context, it's hard to assess.

5. **Fifth Tweet**: ""AT_USER AT_USER i haven't been to a mall in several years . i either do $ amzn AT_USER AT_USER or occasionally AT_USER"". This seems like a message encouraging users to check out AMZN by mentioning the mall and their own experience. It's more about sentiment than stock price.

6. **Sixth Tweet**: ""small-cap stocks breaking 52 - wk high prices $ oas $ tsco $ amzn $ do newsletter URL"". The user is signaling that small-cap stocks are breaking through 52-week highs, but it doesn't mention AMZN specifically. It might be pushing the sentiment towards a positive outlook for smaller companies in general.

7. **Seventh Tweet**: ""are you hanging on to $ tri $ hrc $ lkq $ amzn stockmarket URL"". Similar to the first and third tweets, this seems like an investment strategy without directly targeting AMZN.

8. **Eighth Tweet**: ""$ amzn : can amazon continue higher ? URL"". Again, it's a question indicating whether Amazon can continue increasing. It's encouraging users' thoughts but doesn't provide any direct information about the stock price or its performance.

So, overall, none of these tweets provide specific data that would significantly influence AMZN's stock price. They mostly serve as promotional messages or surveys without actionable content. Therefore, the impact is likely [Neutral]."
2014-05-05,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. The user provided 13 tweets about Amazon and other stocks, and I need to analyze each one.

Starting with the first tweet: ""are you considering buying $ cwh $ dhi $ phm $ amzn worth a look URL"". It seems like the user is suggesting an investment but isn't making any specific claims. I think this might be a way to suggest they're interested in Amazon, which could boost their stock.

Next, "" $ cern best pennystock research $ pten $ panw $ amzn worth a look URL"". Here, it looks like the user is researching pennystocks related to Amazon. This could indicate that they see potential but aren't necessarily buying anything yet. It's possible they're just looking into investment opportunities.

The third tweet mentions ""amzn news alert : URL updated options view : URL all options views : URL"", which sounds like a news update with alerts on options trading. It might be about Amazon stock being more accessible or beneficial, but not sure yet.

 tweet 4 says, ""could be breaktout time on $ foxa $ bhi $ inta $ amzn singedinvestor URL"". This seems to suggest that there's a potential sell-off happening around the current point. If this is predicting a breaking trend where Amazon's stock might dip, it could lead to selling pressure.

 tweet 5: "" $ amzn why jeff bezos , amazon are now on the hot seat URL"". Jeffer bezos was a big executive at Amazon; mentioning him being on the hot seat could imply increased attention or focus, which might influence investor sentiment positively. But I'm not sure if it's positive enough to outweigh other factors.

 tweet 6: "" $ lnc pennystock research on $ pten $ dbd $ amzn newsletter URL"". Similar to tweet 2, this is about research and investment in Amazon's pennystocks. It's speculative but could indicate interest without a clear buy signal yet.

 tweet 7 says, ""monday links : wants unsatisfied , risk appetite divergences and p2p going big time . URL $ hyg $ brkb $ amzn $ yhoo $ twtr $ ipo"". This seems like a general update on Amazon's future, mentioning risks and partnerships. It's quite broad but doesn't give a clear positive or negative outlook.

 tweet 8: ""rt AT_USER now you can order from a twitter hashtag on amazon . new $ ttr $ amzn partnership URL"". This sounds promising for an upcoming partnership or deal, which could mean Amazon is getting more resources or partnerships. The use of a Twitter hashtag might attract new investors quickly.

 tweet 9: ""stock genie alets magical source of profits $ aeye $ cmgo $ amzn & more ! followandprofit ( retweet ) makemoney stockaction stockmarket"". This sounds like a call to action, suggesting they can make money through Amazon. If they're offering rewards for following them, it could boost demand or user interest.

 tweet 10: ""mxwl wants higher imo , see charts . $ tsla deal potential $ plug $ aapl $ amzn $ nflx $ gtat $ znga $ yelp $ onvo $ ddd $ avav $ twtr $ f $ gm $ aa $ extr"". It mentions Tesla, Amazon, and other companies. If Tesla is a competitor or part of Amazon's ecosystem, it could mean Amazon is trying to capture more market share or benefits from Tesla's success.

 tweet 11: ""AT_USER a lot of people talk about what $ amzn could earn , but that's different than actual income ."". It seems to critique the current level of earnings for Amazon, suggesting they're not meeting expectations. This could lead to negative sentiment because if competitors are ahead, users might sell their stock.

 tweet 12: ""stock market reports you need on $ bf $ axs $ vrtx $ amzn wealthmanagement URL"". The user is requesting financial data about Amazon and others. If the platform requires real-time data from other companies, it could put pressure on Amazon's performance, potentially lowering investor confidence.

 tweet 13: ""amzn why amazon's smartphone will be dead on arrival URL"". This seems unrelated to Amazon stock but mentions a tech product moving on Amazon. It might affect Amazon's sales or user base, which could influence the stock price negatively if they lose market share.

Putting it all together, some tweets are speculative and have vague ideas (tweets 2,4,6,10), while others provide more concrete information like partnerships, partnerships with Tesla, or news about options trading. The mix of positive tweets (like potential breakouts, partnerships, and generating rewards) and negative tweets (situations where users are unhappy) makes it hard to decide a clear overall sentiment. There's too much variation in the content to conclude definitively."
2014-05-06,Negative,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by reading through all the tweets carefully.

1. The first tweet talks about Tony soprano being a co-founder and how it affects both Amazon and NFLX. That seems like a positive note for Amazon's long-term potential, so that's good.

2. The second tweet is about some research on pennystock, but I don't see specific details. Maybe there's some market analysis or predictions here, which could influence investor sentiment.

3. The third tweet mentions the stock's aroma being like a bass in a car trunk. That sounds more like something positive and energetic, indicating good news for Amazon.

4. Twitter is picking up some keywords related to Amazon. This suggests that the company is in higher demand or viewed by investors positively, which usually means positive sentiment.

5. The tweet about Amazon partnering with Twitter creates an AmazonCart platform. While partnerships can be positive, it's not clear if this directly impacts Amazon's stock price without more context.

6. A post on finding a moving average suggests technical analysis might have influenced investor decisions, but without specifics on what they're looking for, it's hard to tell.

7. The tweet highlights significant revenue and net income, which is generally positive, especially in the tech sector. This could boost Amazon's stock price.

8. Another Twitter post about mover stocks researching competitors. Similar to point 6, this might influence investor sentiment based on what they're looking for.

9. A tweet mentions beta discount opportunities for a company called ECL. I know ECL can sometimes benefit from tech companies, but it's speculative and not directly related to Amazon's performance.

10. The tweet about losing money in the last week could indicate negative news that might affect Amazon's fundamentals, thus impacting stock price.

11. A tweet talking about a DPC developer promoting an app console with discounts across markets. If Amazon is investing in this, it could be positive for their future projects or services.

12. The overall sentiment for SP500 stocks is down 22% year-to-date. This is a significant drop and could signal that the market is bearish on tech stocks overall.

13. A tweet from someone who thinks Amazon will be a huge holder trying to exit. This sounds like insider trading or active management, which can sometimes lead to positive sentiment if it's about making good decisions but also might hint at risks.

14. Adding to Amazon's wish list suggests they're expanding their portfolio, which could mean future growth and better stock performance.

15. A tweet questioning whether you should hold Amazon based on recent news. If there's a lot of fear or uncertainty, that would be negative sentiment.

16. Several other tweets about various tech stocks including Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, etc. Some might provide positive insights, but others like ECL and the overall SP500 could suggest overall negative trends.

Putting it all together: Amazon has some strong positive points like revenue, earnings, partnerships, and a potential future expansion. However, there are some negative signs like the overall stock drop, technical analysis, uncertain financial news, and speculation about insider trading. The combination of mixed signals might make it difficult to determine a clear overall sentiment.

I think the positive factors point in one direction, while negatives have other aspects. It's probably safer to lean towards a mix, but maybe leaning more positive since some positive tweets are outnumbered by negative ones."
2014-05-07,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about Amazon's stock to determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative. I'm not super familiar with all the terms used here, but I'll do my best.

First, looking at each tweet individually might help. So, starting with the first one: "" todays movers to research $ hpt $ amzn $ rht $ cadx moneymanagement URL"". Hmm, it seems like a list of stocks and something called 'movers.' Maybe this is about Amazon in a specific context? I'm not sure what 'moneymanagement' refers to here. Perhaps it's an unrelated topic or maybe a typo.

The second tweet mentions that Amazon is ""a stock of faith"" with reinforced ideologies, similar to how GS was during the credit crash. That sounds negative because it implies trust issues and instability. But I'm not certain about the specific events in 2008 related to GS. Maybe I should hold off on this one.

The third tweet talks about a specific day where Amazon's price was 408, but then it gets a lot of attention with opposition from Saturn at 22 and opposition from Scorpio Gann Trading at 22? That doesn't seem to relate directly to Amazon's stock. I might skip this one too.

The fourth tweet is about Amazon setting a new B2B goal: ""to supply everything needed to rebuild civilization."" That sounds positive because it's about expanding or providing essential services, which could indicate growth and stability in the company.

Fifth tweet mentions a new e-commerce jolt by shipping. That might suggest a good moment for growth and expansion, which is positive.

Sixth tweet links Alibaba's IPO in the U.S., so that's definitely a major event affecting Amazon. If Alibaba's IPO goes well, it could boost Amazon's shares, making this positive.

Seventh tweet asks about $CNW, $WPX, $XOM, and Amazon again. These are all different companies. I'm not sure what these abbreviations stand for—could they be related to Amazon? Maybe, but without more context, it's hard to tell if this is a positive or negative event.

Eighth tweet compares Twitter accounts of Amazon and Alibaba IPO on the same topic. It might just be another opinion bubble, so maybe not indicative of the stock sentiment directly.

Ninth tweet mentions BA (Amazon) being bearish or bullish based on $MET and $ITT. That's about broader market conditions, but how it affects Amazon's specific stock is unclear. I'm not sure if this is positive, negative, or neutral.

Tenth tweet provides expected price ranges for various stocks. This seems more like data than a tweet that affects the stock price directly.

Eleventh tweet suggests that on chart days without an amazing appearance, Amazon has been ""buying the dip."" That's a bit vague and might be a trend rather than specific to Amazon. It could be seen as neutral because it's not about Amazon itself but about the market sentiment.

Twelfth tweet is about ORLY looking for next AO orTel liquidity. Liquidity might affect stock price, especially if they're trying to manage cash reserves, but again, without context, it's hard to say.

Thirteenth tweet talks about Yelp plummings and probes, which could have social media effects on the company, possibly affecting their stock indirectly. That might be considered a minor impact or not directly related.

Putting all these together: The main positive signs are the B2B goal for Amazon, the e-commerce jolt, and the potential for liquidity issues. However, some tweets seem to point towards negative sentiment from things like the credit crash and trust issues with GS. Since there's both positive and negative factors, it's hard to assign a clear overall sentiment.

But looking at other sources, I remember that Amazon was doing well during the 2008 financial crisis and has been expanding into new areas. So maybe the overall impact is positive despite some negative thoughts."
2014-05-08,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, each tweet is about the stock performance for Amazon. Starting with the first tweet: "" $ amzn - amazon will start delivering packages on sundays to fifteen new cities -> URL stock stocks stockaction "". The user is predicting a positive outcome with more deliveries and mentions specific cities. That sounds encouraging, so this could be positive.

The second tweet says: "" rt AT_USER $ aapl tiene un potencial de alza de acuerdo a su precio objetivo de 6 % mientras que $ amzn de 44 % . sugerimos ese swap "". It seems to suggest Amazon has potential with a 6% target price compared to Amz at 44%. This positive outlook might be seen as positive for the stock. The use of ""potencial"" (potential) adds a hopeful tone.

Third tweet: ""$ amzn : amazons cheap ride is over , no easy fix in sight URL"". It looks like Amazon is facing challenges, suggesting instability or uncertainty. This could be negative because it might reduce investor confidence.

Fourth tweet mentions ABANDONING THE AMZN APL, but I think it's referring to a previous tweet about $ amzn. The user is focusing on stock actions and possibly suggesting swaps, which isn't clear. Maybe neutral or unsure without more context.

Fifth tweet: ""but when i order on friday i'm not in the office to pick it up sunday ... firstworldproblems URL via AT_USER $ amzn"". This seems like a technicality about ordering but doesn't provide immediate information on stock performance, so probably neutral.

Sixth tweet: ""$ amzn amazon adds 15 cities to sunday delivery service URL"". More deliveries would likely increase demand and earnings, which is positive. So another positive point here.

Seventh tweet mentions Jim's analysis: ""rt AT_USER jim , if you bought $ zu in march ( thinnking its $ amzn ) you only need to be up + 117 % ( from here ) to breakeven booyah AT_USER"". It seems like Jim is suggesting a performance target, which might indicate confidence or potential future returns. This could be positive.

Lastly, the same tweet about Sunday delivery service adding more cities reinforces the idea that demand is increasing, leading to better earnings and stock gains. So overall, there are multiple positive points but also some negative ones about instability in Amazon's deliveries and Jim's expectations.

Considering all these factors, while there are some conflicting views, the overall trend seems more positive than negative because of increased demand for Amazon's services."
2014-05-09,Negative,"Alright, I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of the given company, which is Amazon (AMZ). Let me start by breaking down each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol. Looking at the tweets, AMZN appears in several of them, so that's my target. Now, for each tweet, I need to separate the positive and negative factors.

In tweet 1, it mentions a portfolio report card telling the user if something passes or fails. The URL suggests a financial report, which usually indicates investor sentiment is positive. So this could be a positive factor.

Tweet 2 talks about Amazon and Google planning their internet fast lane plans. That's related to their business operations but not directly affecting AMZN's stock price. It might be neutral because it's more about the company's future plans rather than immediate performance.

 Tweet 3 states that Amazon is on the cusp of a bottom, which suggests investor caution or uncertainty. This is a negative factor as it affects market sentiment and could lead to selling pressure on AMZN.

Tweet 4 mentions an newsletter from AT_USER, which I assume is a typo for "" ""@"" or another user name. If this newsletter has issues or problems with investors, that would be a negative factor affecting the stock price. The mention of something about options and several symbols suggests it's related to their newsletter content, which could impact AMZN.

Now, summarizing each tweet:

1. Positive (pass/fail report)
2. Neutral (planning future plans)
3. Negative (on cusp of bottom)
4. Negative (investor newsletter issues)

The overall sentiment combines these. The pass/fail report is positive, but the negative tweets about being on a cusp and investor newsletter problems pull the overall sentiment down.

So, the overall sentiment should be negative because there are mixed signals from different directions."
2014-05-10,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about Amazon. First, I'll look at each tweet individually and break them down into factors—Positive (P) and Negative (N). Then, I'll assess the sentiment of each factor and combine it all together to see if the overall impact is positive, neutral, or negative.

Starting with the first tweet: ""The $ amzn : apple buying beats for $ 3.2 billion ? smart move URL"". Hmm, that seems like a typo because ""$ amzn"" doesn't make much sense in this context. Maybe it's supposed to be about the earnings or something else? I'm not sure, but the fact that they're predicting a sale of $3.2 billion and it's a ""smart move"" might suggest a strategic decision. But since the symbol seems off, I should probably leave that out for now.

The second tweet is just: ""<b>Twitter: Amazon has announced significant upgrades to its cloud infrastructure. The company said it will deploy 100 new data centers in North America and enhance user experience across all platforms. The announcement comes as part of the broader expansion of Amazon's digital transformation efforts."" Okay, this seems positive because they're talking about major changes and expanding their cloud services. That sounds like a good move for Amazon.

The third tweet is: ""<b>Twitter: Amazon has become the most valuable company in the U.S., according to new data released by the Wall Street Journal. The company ranked up 20 positions on the S&P 500 and will have a market capitalization of $183 billion as of today."" This is also positive because it's a solid announcement about Amazon's growth and valuation, which could impact investor sentiment positively.

Putting this together: The first tweet has an uncertain symbol issue but mentions a significant purchase. The second tweet is clearly positive with strong cloud infrastructure upgrades. The third tweet is definitely positive about Amazon becoming a major player. However, I'm not sure if the first tweet adds much beyond the ""smart move"" prediction; maybe it's too vague.

So overall, considering the clear and impactful posts from Twitter, especially the two that are substantial, they likely have a positive impact on Amazon's stock price."
2014-05-11,Missing,File not found
2014-05-12,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for a given company. Let me break down the process step by step.

First, I need to extract the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the tweets provided:

1. "" $ dltr top performing stocks today $ msft $ ewbc $ amzn wealthmanagement rate_limit_exceeded"" – It mentions MSFT (Microsoft), ETC (Equity Tracking Fund), AMZN (Amazon), and WEALTH MANAGEMENT, but it's unclear if this is a specific stock or a general category. Since the user wants to analyze each tweet separately, I think each line might represent different stocks. But since I don't have all the information, maybe I should assume that each line refers to different stocks unless specified otherwise.

Wait, actually, looking again, it seems like some of these are referring to multiple stocks in one tweet, but without more context, it's hard to tell which one they're focusing on. Maybe each tweet is about a specific stock or a category?

But since the user provided several tweets and wants an analysis for each line, I think I should treat each line as separate and analyze each target stock individually.

Now, moving on to the second step: Tweet-by-Tweet Analysis. For each tweet, I need to separate positive (P) and negative (N) factors. 

Let's go through each one:

1. ""$ dltr top performing stocks today $ msft $ ewbc $ amzn wealthmanagement rate_limit_exceeded""
   - This seems to be discussing performance of specific stocks and mentions WEALTH MANAGEMENT, which could relate to something like Wealth Management services. But it's unclear if this is a specific stock or just general info.

2. ""AT_USER lol and fuck that was an $ amzn chart not $ spy . ' amzn looks amazin "" . ' spy looks considerably less organized . pourmeacoffee""
   - This tweet seems to be reacting to something, possibly about the performance of AMZN (Amazon) or SPY (Spy is often for SPY ETFs like VOO). The user mentions ""fuck that was an amzn chart not spy"" which could mean they're upset or criticizing a stock. However, without context, it's ambiguous. But I can see negative emojis and some criticism of SPY's organization, suggesting negative sentiment.

3. ""$ amzn twitter's amazon purchase tool : a shot in the arm for social media ? [ at motley fool ] - social shopping has ... URL""
   - This is a Twitter post talking about an Amazon purchase tool, which could be related to the company or services they provide. The mention of Social Shopping and their focus on social media suggests a positive angle, but it's speculative without more context.

4. ""$ rax bought 140920 c 29.00 . long term looks good despite competition from $ vmw $ amzn and big decline.""
   - This seems to be about buying shares of RAX stock at a price of $29 on day 140920. The user mentions ""long term looks good despite competition"" which is generally positive, but a ""big decline"" could indicate uncertainty or poor performance in the short term. But overall, it's more about their outlook than a clear positive sentiment.

5. ""rt AT_USER “ AT_USER what a great post - $ twtr $ lnkd $ amzn $ tsla URL < sometimes there's a rainbow""
   - Another Twitter post by the same user discussing TWTR (Twitter) stock, LNKD (Neuralink), AMZN, and TSLA (Technological Solutions). The mention of ""rainbow"" could be metaphorical or unrelated. There's no clear positive or negative here.

6. ""$ amzn URL inc . web services floating on cloud nine URL""
   - This tweet is likely about the performance of AMZN stock increasing, as it's in the web services category. It might suggest a positive trend but without context, it's hard to know if it's from a positive or negative perspective.

7. ""our $ amzn may 300 calls now 5.03 from our buy at 3.90 URL $ spy $ mu $ v $ tsla $ fb $ nflx $ ebay $ qcom $ vxx $ spx $ lmt $ mnst""
   - This seems to be a call to action for Amazon, suggesting a potential rise in price after buying shares at $3.90 and expecting it to go up by $1.03. Positive numbers could indicate confidence or expectation.

Now, summarizing each tweet:

1. Unclear target, but possibly MSFT.
2. Negative reactions about AMZN vs SPY.
3. Speculative about social media tools for AMZN.
4. General outlook on RAX stock with competition issues.
5. Twitter post discussing multiple stocks.
6. Positive web services performance of AMZN.
7. Call to action for Amazon's price increase.

For the overall sentiment:

- Negative: The second tweet clearly expresses negative reactions towards SPY, which is often used as a benchmark ETF. This can affect investor sentiment negatively.
- Neutral: The fourth tweet gives a positive outlook on RAX stock, but without context, it's hard to say if that's a strong or neutral position.
- Positive: The seventh tweet could be seen as positive for Amazon, encouraging investors to buy based on expectations.

But considering all tweets, the second one is the most critical with clear negative sentiment towards SPY. Without a clear majority of positive or negative sentiments, it might be considered neutral overall. Alternatively, given that one tweet has strong negative influence and others are positive in their own ways, maybe the overall sentiment leans towards neutral."
2014-05-13,Neutral,"Alright, so I'm looking at this query where someone wants me to analyze some tweets about the stock price impact on Amazon's (AMZN) future. The user has provided six tweets and is asking for my analysis using [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative] tags.

First, I need to understand what each tweet is saying. Let me go through them one by one.

1. ""rt AT_USER why sears should just call it quits already URL $ shld $ amzn"" – Hmm, this seems like someone is questioning the decision of a user at Sears, which is related to Amazon's stock. I'm not sure about the context here; maybe they're concerned about something else?

2. ""$ amzn nothin ' but net neutrality : even amazon and ebay are fans URL"" – This tweet seems critical about net neutrality issues affecting Amazon and eBay. Users seem to be worried about internet policies, which could impact their business. That's a bit of a mixed signal because while it's important, the overall sentiment isn't clear yet.

3. ""rt AT_USER a fight to the finish ! the investing throwdown | young finances URL $ fb $ lb $ amzn $ aapl"" – This tweet is repeating something with 'a fight' and 'throwdown,' which might be trying to provoke more attention or action. It doesn't directly say if it's positive, negative, or neutral about Amazon.

4. ""rt AT_USER the same thing rt ! a fight to the finish ! investing throwdown | young finances URL $ fb $ lb $ amzn $ aapl"" – Another repetition of the previous tweet, perhaps further provoking attention without providing any specific information about the stock performance.

5. ""$ amzn [ video ] reasons to be cautious with alibaba URL"" – This tweet is suggesting that Amazon should be cautious before considering Alibaba (ABT). It's talking about the risks involved in a trade-off and advises caution. That seems like a positive move because it's offering guidance without recommending actions, which might encourage investors positively.

6. ""$ amzn : motorola adds lte and microsd support to the moto g URL"" – This tweet is related to a specific product update for Amazon's Moto phone, mentioning additional features like LTE and microSD support. While this could be seen as positive news about Amazon's products or services, it might also depend on whether that directly relates to their stock performance.

Now, putting it all together, I notice some tweets are directly addressing business issues (net neutrality, product updates) which could have negative impacts if not managed well. However, others like the fifth tweet provide advice without specific downside mentions. The overall sentiment seems leaning towards positive because of the constructive information about caution and new features. But the mixed critical comments might suggest a neutral or slightly negative overall view.

I need to decide whether to consider the negative factors more than the positive ones or if they're balanced. Since some tweets are critical but others offer guidance, it's challenging. Maybe I should lean towards [Neutral] because while there are some positive points, the critical issues could overshadow them, making the sentiment uncertain."
2014-05-14,Negative,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me break down each tweet one by one.

First tweet: ""$ amzn - why the openstack cloud bubble will soon burst"". OpenStack is a cloud provider, so this seems related. A bubble in technology could indicate optimism about the future, which might boost Amazon's stock. So I think this is positive.

Second tweet: ""$ amzn - tech stocks slip ; cisco earnings on tap"". Tech stocks slipping suggests some concern, but CISCOP is a major player, maybe they have good news or worse? Not sure yet. It could impact Amazon's view of the economy. Hmm, unsure, so maybe positive or neutral.

Third tweet: ""stock market analysis video link URL $ spy $ qqq $ aapl $ googl $ nflx $ tsla $ amzn URL"". Multiple stocks are mentioned, including tech giants and others like Tesla. The spread could be confusing, but if these sectors are all doing well, it might boost Amazon's outlook. So positive.

Fourth tweet: "" retail apocalypse , wearables and re-commerce : my hit on bloomberg radio "" taking stock "" $ aapl $ nke $ brby $ m $ amzn $ r … URL"". The mention of retail and tech companies like NKE (NeXT, which is down), BRBY (Borealis, up or down?), and Apple's news. Retail apocalypse might affect consumer spending, but Amazon is focused on technology. Maybe this could be a mixed signal because both tech and some retail sectors are affected. So overall positive or neutral.

Now, combining all these: Positive from the cloud bubble, Neutral from tech stocks slipping, Positive from multiple tech stocks, and maybe a slight negative from retail. Overall sentiment seems positive."
2014-05-15,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze the impact on Amazon's stock price based on the provided tweets. Let me break down each tweet and see what they're suggesting.

First tweet is ""$ amzn amazon hints at newark distribution center lease URL"". Hmm, ""hints at"" suggests something is under consideration. Maybe Amazon is looking into moving a facility or something related to their operations. That's generally positive because it might lead to cost savings or strategic advancements, which could improve the company's image.

Second tweet is ""$ amzn - [ $ $ ] is no one neutral over net neutrality ? -> URL stock stocks stockaction"". The mention of ""net neutrality"" seems concerning. It suggests that there are issues with how internet services charge for data transmission. If this leads to more competition or higher prices, it might hurt Amazon's stock. But I'm not entirely sure; the use of URL and ""stockaction"" is a bit unclear.

Third tweet: ""$ amzn : amid protests , u . s . fcc proposes new net neutrality rules URL"". Similar to the second tweet, this indicates a potential regulatory issue in the US regarding internet neutrality. Proponents might say it's good for competition and innovation, while critics could see it as unfair or leading to higher costs. It seems like both tweets point towards possible changes that Amazon needs to consider.

Putting it together: The first tweet suggests operational improvement, which is positive. The other two are pointing out potential regulatory issues, which could be negative if they cause problems but also have the possibility of innovation benefits. I'm a bit torn because one factor is positive and the others are mixed. Without more context on how these changes will play out, it's hard to decide the overall impact. Maybe the positive tweet has the most significant effect on Amazon's performance."
2014-05-16,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

First tweet says Amazon promises new kids’s shows will foster learning. This is a positive because it could lead to better education outcomes and maybe lower costs in entertainment. So that's a plus for Amazon.

Second tweet talks about Amazon attacking a potential trillion-dollar industry, which isn't very encouraging. Investors are usually cautious when companies face big risks or losses. So this might be negative.

Third tweet asks about Amazon’s locker in San Francisco, which is irrelevant because Amazon doesn’t have one. The tweet is confusing and not useful for the stock.

Fourth tweet mentions a lobbying battle over open internet services. This could affect Amazon's strategy and possibly market share, but it's still positive because it might drive competition or new revenue streams.

Fifth tweet shows a 23/100 trend with specific percentages. This suggests strong upward movement in the stock price, which is good for Amazon. But I need to look at other factors too.

Sixth tweet mentions PMG's products but doesn’t relate directly to Amazon’s performance. It seems unrelated and might not impact the stock.

Seventh tweet asks about what's inside Amazon's locker, which is a distraction and not relevant. The tweet isn't providing useful information for investors.

Now, combining all this: There are positive factors like new kids shows leading to better education and a lobbying battle, but one negative from the industry risk. The overall trend is strong upward movement because of the 23/100 rise. So, despite some negatives, the positive factors outweigh the negatives."
2014-05-17,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on Amazon's stock price. First, I need to identify the target stock, which is Amazon (AMZN). Now, looking at each tweet:

1. The first tweet mentions investigations into mobile app practices by Apple, Google, and Amazon. This could be positive because it highlights areas where they might be improving or facing challenges that other companies are taking action against. However, investigations don't necessarily always lead to a positive outcome unless there's an expectation of improvement.

2. The second tweet talks about skt pennystock researching DDD, Agco, and Amzn stock prices. This seems like it could be negative because if investors expect Amzn to perform well due to this research, they might buy more shares, affecting the overall price.

3. The third tweet suggests seeking the next stock similar to SFG, Leco, or Amzn. Similar to the first tweet, without specifics on what those stocks are, it's hard to assess if their performance would positively influence Amzn. It could be speculative and not directly related.

So, combining these thoughts: There's some uncertainty from the investigations but there's also an expectation of positive action based on research. However, since DDD and Agco aren't specific to Amazon, it's risky to say for sure if this will positively impact. Therefore, I think the overall sentiment is Neutral because while there might be mixed signals, without more information about Amzn's performance or future expectations, it's hard to conclude definitively."
2014-05-18,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of Apple (AMZN). Let me break it down step by step.

First, the target stock is AMZN. Each tweet seems to be from a user accessing information about mobile app practices at companies like Apple, Google, Amazon, etc. 

Looking at each tweet: most of them are just repeating ""rt AT_USER URL access what pros on the floor are trading"" with varying messages. There are duplicates and multiple tweets in a row. I don't see any positive or negative words here; they're all about accessing info without any tips, insights, or recommendations.

Since none of these tweets provide any information that would suggest improvement or decline in AMZN's financials, stock performance, or company strategy, it seems like there are no factors influencing investor sentiment towards AMZN. They might be just testing or not providing relevant data to impact the market.

Therefore, combining all these tweets doesn't give a clear indication of whether AMZN is going up, staying the same, or going down. It's as if they're providing no actionable information that could sway the stock price."
2014-05-19,Negative,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

Starting with tweet 1: It mentions a bearish bearish bullish chart. That seems pretty negative for Amazon, so that's probably a negative factor.

Tweet 2 talks about buying stocks using moving averages but doesn't specify if it's bullish or bearish. I need to see more context next time on this.

Tweet 3 uses terms like breakout and gains, which are common in stock market trends. A breakout often indicates potential price action, but the language is vague without specifics.

Tweet 4 suggests watching a specific stock for the week using a URL. This could be about news or analysis that might influence sentiment.

Tweets 5 and 11 mention key levels and chart structures to watch. These are technical analysis tools that generally show bearish signals if prices are below support areas, which can lead to selling pressure.

Tweet 6 is similar to tweet 3, just the same factors mentioned again without more details.

Tweet 7 suggests hiring a drone team for Amazon, which could be about news or earnings, possibly positive.

Tweets 8 talks about significant government changes in India, which might impact stock sentiment if there are regulatory shifts.

Tweet 9 is a news alert on updating options views, which can sometimes push prices down as they look to correct expectations.

Overall, most tweets seem to talk about trends (like bearish or bullish) but don't have enough specific information. The technical terms in some tweets like breakout and chart structures indicate potential price action, but without clear indicators of support or resistance, it's hard to know if it's bearish or bullish.

There are a couple of positive points: the drone team hiring (7) and the government news (8), but these seem too vague. Most of the other tweets are either too general or negative in nature."
2014-05-20,Negative,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how these tweets are affecting Amazon's stock price from my analysis. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock mentioned in each tweet, which is Amazon (AMZN). Then, for each tweet, I need to separate them into positive and negative factors. After that, I assess the sentiment based on those factors and combine them to determine if the overall impact is positive, neutral, or negative.

Starting with the first tweet: ""did you lose money on $ mygn $ nov $ gas $ amzn singedinvestor URL."" Hmm, it seems like a typo about losing money but doesn't provide specific information about AMZN's performance. I can't analyze this one yet because there's no concrete data or positive/negative factor.

Moving to the second tweet: ""stock watchlist you should be looking at $ ub $ pll $ m $ amzn click URL."" This seems like a call for action, suggesting that AMZN is on their watch list. But again, without specific sentiment indicators from Twitter, it's hard to assess the impact on the stock price.

Third tweet: ""whats going on with $ amzn $ kmpr $ dnkn $ blox stockmarket URL."" This one mentions a typo for AMZN but also includes terms like ""kmpR"" which might refer to something else. The presence of ""stockmarket"" suggests that there's some information about the market, but without context or sentiment cues, I can't say much.

Fourth tweet: ""are you bullish on these stocks $ ulta $ dei $ ufs $ amzn investing URL."" This is a call for investment, specifically mentioning bullishness. The term ""bullish"" often indicates optimism and potential gains, so this tweet might be positive.

Fifth tweet: ""stock market reports you need on $ rjf $ trow $ sd $ amzn equity URL."" Another request to get updates on the stock market. Like the previous ones, without specific information or sentiment indicators, it's challenging to determine the impact.

Sixth tweet: ""amzn rackspace surges on buyout rumors URL."" This indicates that AMZN is experiencing increased space utilization due to buyout rumors, which could mean strategic growth or expansion. This might lead to higher stock prices, suggesting a positive impact.

Seventh tweet: ""find the next hot pennystock $ hcn $ mcd $ penn $ amzn view now URL."" A call for the next hot stock, which can influence sentiment positively as potential winners in the market.

Eighth tweet: ""rt AT_USER amazon $ amzn with more than 1,000 june 13th ( w ) $ 310 calls bought $ 5.40 to $ 5.60."" This is about trading specifics—placing orders. It's possible that this relates to stock performance, but without data on the price movement or sentiment, it's hard to assess.

Ninth tweet: ""spy $ aapl $ nflx $ amzn $ iwm $ twtr $ googl $ tsla titans nicely setting up for a big move . see video URL."" This is a call for action with specific stocks and mentions a video. It could be related to news about upcoming moves, which might affect AMZN's price.

Tenth tweet: ""fibonacci technical levels $ amzn , $ aapl , $ fb , $ goog url"" includes Fibonacci levels but doesn't specify the outcome or sentiment on AMZN.

Eleventh tweet: ""looking for the next winners like $ gas $ uthr $ stx $ amzn personalfinance URL."" Again, a call to action focusing on finding winners, which can influence investor sentiment positively.

After going through each tweet, I identified several positive indicators that suggest potential gains (like the user calls and mentions upcoming moves). However, without specific data or direct financial impact from these tweets, it's hard to be certain. The presence of terms like ""bullish,"" ""rackspace surges,"" ""next hot stock,"" and ""upcoming moves"" in multiple tweets suggests a mix of positive and neutral influences on AMZN's stock price."
2014-05-21,Negative,"Alright, I need to figure out the sentiment from the provided text. Let me read through it carefully.

First, there are numerous links and URLs like ""http://www.nasdaq.com/sna/viab[vi]"" which seem unrelated or perhaps errors in the URL. Then, I see a lot of mentions of $viab and $sna on Nasdaq Street Trends. The user is talking about buying or selling stocks: $dnb, $rrc, $crl, $amzn.

There's also a part where the user says ""visit URL"" multiple times, which might be an error or typo. But overall, the main topics are investing in stocks and trends on Nasdaq, with some unrelated links that don't seem to contribute much to sentiment.

Since most of the content is about market updates and stock-related discussions without clear positive or negative language, it seems like the sentiment remains neutral."
2014-05-22,Positive,"Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the overall sentiment based on all these data points. The user provided a list of 85 lines, some about stock prices and a bunch of URL links. They want me to conclude with either Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

First, looking through the content, most of the lines are talking about stock price trends—like amzn going up, fb going up, goog going down, etc. There's also some mention of formulas predicting price movements and different URLs that seem like product recommendations or market condition assessments.

Hmm, the majority of these points are about positive outcomes for certain stocks. For example, amzn equity is mentioned with ""positive,"" which makes me think it's performing well. Other lines talk about formulas accurately predicting prices—this could be seen as a positive signal for investors who follow financial trends.

But then there are some negative statements like ""will goog step in?"" and ""will fb should have bought them instead of oculus."" These look more speculative, which might indicate uncertainty or fear about the companies. The term ""step in"" suggests that people think goog will join forces to support a company, which could be positive if it relates to strategic alliances or partnerships.

However, the overall sentiment isn't clear-cut because there's a mix of positive and some negative statements. Some lines are more informative (like market conditions) but others seem more like opinions rather than concrete information. Without specific indicators of investor sentiment from other sources, it's hard to say definitively.

But considering that the majority of these messages are about stock performance and formulas predicting movements, which often indicate optimism among investors, maybe I lean towards a positive sentiment overall. The speculative yet somewhat balanced nature might suggest mixed emotions, but in terms of information content about stocks performing well, positivity seems predominant."
2014-05-23,Negative,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify each tweet and extract the relevant information. Each tweet is about Amazon, so that might be my target stock symbol. But wait, looking at the tweets, most of them mention ""Amazon"" or parts of their name like ""bby,"" which probably refers to the stock ticker AMZN. So maybe the target stock is AMZN.

Next, I have to look for factors in each tweet—positive and negative. Let me go through each one:

1. ""using stores as shipping portals is giving retailers like best buy a leg up on amazon URL $ amzn $ bby $ m $ wmt"" - This seems positive because it mentions how Amazon can help others, which might boost AMZN's performance.

2. ""here's one thing best buy has that amazon doesn't : URL photo / getty $ bby $ am zn url"" - Hmm, no clear factors here; more of a compliment than an action suggesting change in sentiment.

3. ""$ amzn - amazon is messing with book sales for a major book publisher -> URL stock stocks stockaction"" - This looks like a negative point because it mentions Amazon affecting book sales negatively, which could hurt AMZN.

4. ""AT_USER exactly like people who sign up for $ amzn prime . total behavioral shift ."" - More about user actions than factors here; not sure if that's positive or negative.

5. ""$ azo $ avt $ mac $ amzn nse url"" - No clear info, so probably nothing here.

6. ""$ amzn greed can blind an investor to sell signals and market tops URL"" - This seems like a negative sentiment because it warns about Amazon being too greedy and potentially hiding sells or trends, which could reduce AMZN's value.

7. ""did you lose money on $ aa $ cst $ wbc $ am zn financialnews url"" - Another negative point about losing money, which would hurt the stock.

8. ""$ amzn submission of matters to a vote of security holders ( form 8 - k ) URL"" - This is probably a financial statement and doesn't directly affect stock price as much.

9. ""looking for more info on $ xl $ dvn $ spw $ am zn nse url"" - More information without specific factors, so no sentiment here.

10. ""$ amzn amazon’s first original kids series tumble leaf now available on prime instant video URL"" - Positive because it's adding something new to Amazon's product line, which is a good sign for future performance.

11. ""$ amzn amazon's power may be debated amid escalating fight with hachette , nyt says URL"" - This is a bit tricky; it mentions an ongoing conflict but doesn't clearly state whether it's positive or negative. Maybe mixed sentiment?

12. ""are you considering buying $ orcl $ apc $ hsic $ am zn try this url"" - More about actions than factors, so no specific info here.

13. ""$ amzn candles 4/28 first clue bottom was close on high vol , 5/7- 5/9 candles tested 4/28 lod , able to recover . higher lows and off we go URL"" - This sounds like a positive update about Amazon's performance, showing potential recovery after some challenges.

Now, looking at the overall sentiment. I have several negative tweets that mention things Amazon is doing or not being done, which could affect AMZN. There are mixed tweets from 10 and 11, but many are neutral (tweets 2,5,8). Then there's a positive update about candlestick patterns suggesting recovery.

Considering all the factors—positive updates like tweet 13, neutral tweets, and some negative ones—it seems like overall sentiment leans towards a slight negative impact because of the mixed information and one positive point that might not outweigh the negatives. However, it's also possible that the positive update is significant enough to make the overall impact less negative.

Wait, actually, in tweet 10, Amazon isn't necessarily losing money but expanding their product line, which could be a good sign. But other tweets are negative about Amazon's market performance or strategic issues. It's a bit of a mix.

I think since there are some clear negatives and mixed positives, the overall impact might still be neutral because the positive update isn't enough to outweigh the negative information."
2014-05-24,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by going through each tweet one by one.

First tweet: ""AT_USER robotics may be good for u . s . employment URL $ wmt $ hd $ amzn"". The user is talking about robotics being beneficial for the U.S. job market and mentions Amazon. I'm not sure if this relates to Amazon's performance, so maybe it's neutral or negative.

Second tweet: ""regretting your investment in $ jw $ hst $ ksu $ amzn equity URL"". This seems like an explicit regret statement about investing in Amazon, which could be seen as negative because investors are considering their decisions. But since the user is referring to Amazon specifically, maybe this is also neutral or negative.

Third tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ amzn $ 310 calls alerted real time here : $ 280 into $ 1235 : URL"". This looks like an automated message from AT_USER about AMZN's price. The numbers seem off—$280 to $1235 don't make sense in context, but the idea of alerts might indicate positive action. However, since it's a response from another user on Twitter, it's more about their own actions than impacting Amazon's stock directly.

Fourth tweet: ""$ amzn writers and editors call out amazon for going after hachette , but will it matter ? URL"". The user is referring to Amazon's position relative to Hachette. This could be a bit of fluff or maybe unrelated information, so I'm not sure about the sentiment here.

Looking at the overall factors: Some tweets are context-related like the first one which doesn't directly mention Amazon. Others are personal regret and negative statements. The automated message is just another response. There's no clear positive news about Amazon that I can infer from these tweets. Therefore, it seems like there's no significant impact on Amazon's stock price."
2014-05-25,Positive,"Okay, I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets regarding Amazon's future stock price impact and determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative.

First, let me break down each tweet individually. The first tweet says ""$ amzn who ’ s wearing the black hat , amazon or the book publishers ? URL"". Hmm, that sounds like a joke or maybe a reference to something else. It doesn't seem relevant at all to Amazon's performance. Maybe it's just trying to get somewhere else, so I'll consider this as neutral.

The second tweet is ""The future of the company looks bright."" This one clearly states that the stock market and the overall economy are optimistic for Amazon. The word ""bright"" immediately makes me think of a positive outlook, expecting better results or growth. So, this tweet contributes to a positive sentiment about Amazon.

Wait, but I should also check if there are any other factors in this tweet. It doesn't mention anything else, just expressing expectation for a bright future. That's pretty straightforward.

So, the first tweet is neutral, and the second one leans towards positive. Combining these, overall the sentiment seems to be Positive because while the first tweet has a slight neutral note, the second provides a strong positive outlook that outweighs it."
2014-05-26,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact on Amazon's stock price based on these tweets. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock. The tweets mention ""AMZN"" or ""Amazon,"" so that must be the company in question. So, I'll focus on this one.

Now, looking at each tweet individually. The first one says, ""$ amzn can have nflx type move . any good news and this goes viral . down from 400 . so has a rocket in it . question is does it start."" Hmm, ""fllv"" probably stands for something I'm not familiar with. Maybe it's an abbreviation related to stock trends or predictions.

The user mentions that the stock can move like an NFL team, which could mean a positive sign about potential growth or expansion. It says any good news and this goes viral, implying that people are talking about it online. The stock price is dropping from 400, so if something's going viral, maybe it affects its value.

The tweet ends with ""so has a rocket in it . question is does it start."" I'm guessing ""rocket"" here means significant growth potential. So combining these elements—potential for positive news, virality, and growth—it seems like the stock could potentially rise. But Amazon's current situation might be tough, so maybe not as strong.

I should check if there are any negative factors mentioned. The tweet doesn't explicitly mention anything bad, just focusing on the possibility of positive developments with viral attention. Therefore, I'm leaning towards a positive outlook but recognizing the challenges Amazon may face."
2014-05-27,Negative,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of the given company. The user provided specific steps and a sample output as an example. I need to go through each tweet carefully.

First, I should identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the tweets, it seems they all mention 'aapl' which stands for Apple Inc. So the target is Apple (AAPL). 

Next, I'll look at each tweet individually. The user provided 12 tweets in total. 

Starting with tweet number one: It's about checking out stock options and a trial period. It mentions $ signs before multiple stocks like APLUS, NFLX, FB, TSLA, AMZN. No obvious positive or negative factors mentioned here.

Tweet two is similar to the first; it's repeating the same content but perhaps in different wording. Again, nothing stands out as positive or negative.

Tweets three and four are also very repetitive, just repeating a bunch of options and trial offers without any specific mention of positive or negative aspects.

Tweet five continues the theme with more trials and options, no sentiment here either.

_tweets six to nine are again all about stock options. It looks like it's encouraging users to try different stocks but doesn't present any strong information on positive or negative factors.

Then we have tweet ten, which is slightly different. It mentions 'erni money team' and the price of a common share. It could be offering investment advice, but that's speculative. Maybe the user isn't serious here; perhaps it's just an off-topic message.

Tweet eleven repeats the same structure as tweets five to nine, focusing on stock options and trials without any positive or negative cues.

Tweet twelve is different again. Here, the tweet offers a ""money team"" service with various stocks like APLUS, FB, AMZN, TSLA, NFLX, PFE, ICN, Mines, GOOG, TWTR, and VGP. It's about investing but doesn't provide any positive or negative info.

So, compiling all these thoughts: All tweets are focused on encouraging users to use stock options for different companies. They don't mention anything positive, negative, or neutral regarding the stock price. It seems like a general message towards investment advice without specific analysis.

Therefore, based on this, I'll conclude that there's no clear impact on the stock price from these tweets."
2014-05-28,Negative,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company, which in this case is Amazon (AMZN). Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol, I can see that several tweets mention AMZN. That’s helpful because each tweet is related to AMZN, so they're all connected. 

Now, for each tweet, I need to separate them into positive and negative factors and assess the sentiment. Let me go through each one:

1. The first tweet says, ""$ awk are you bullish on these stocks $ sm $ qcom $ amzn financial URL"". It looks like it's talking about bulls or believers, which is a positive sign for AMZN.
2. Next, ""should you hold or add to $ ctrx $ cmcsa $ cme $ amzn must see URL"" mentions holding or adding to specific stocks, but the language isn't clear on whether it's bullish or bearish.
3. ""$ subscribers saw our penny stock picks gain over 4,000 % this year ! subscribe today : URL $ am zn m cox gove"" mentions a penny stock and talks about stock gains, which is positive.
4. ""new gsma report highlights economic impact of aws spectrum for 4g mobile broadband in latin america"" talks about an upcoming report but doesn't specify the effect on AMZN.
5. ""$ vmw $ bcr $ btu $ amzn equity URL"" mentions specific stocks but again, no clear positive or negative indicators.
6. ""back over $320 timing is key with otm option trade"" suggests that the stock might go up as expected.
7. ""$ aria $ csc $ eqix $ amzn stockmarket URL"" talks about other companies AMZN isn't involved in, so this doesn't impact AMZN directly.
8. ""could be breaktout time on $ urs $ chs $ sbh $ am zn singiinvestor"" mentions a potential breakout but not sure about the effect.
9. ""$ egn $ nav $ ba $ amzn wealthmanagement URL"" talks about portfolio management, which could relate to AMZN's investment strategies.
10. ""defensive portfolio focusing on competitive advantage URL $ aapl apple $ am zn $ fb $ goog $ googl"" again, mentions APM and not directly ties to AMZN.
11. ""migh want to sell $ mon $ ois $ kbr $ amzn investing"" talks about selling positions but doesn't mention the stock's performance.
12. ""$ today looks like it could get ugly $ fb $ ddd $ tsla $ am zn $ grpn $ scty URL"" indicates that AMZN might not be a good investment, suggesting negative sentiment.
13. The long quote with charts and mentions APM and other stocks but no clear positive or negative about AMZN.
14. Another long quote similar to 13.
15. ""buying less inventory from hachette: full story URL"" seems like it's selling stock, which might indicate fear, suggesting a negative impact.
16. Same as tweet 15.

Putting this all together, most tweets are either positive about AMZN (like mentions of being bullish) or indicating that AMZN is expected to go up in price based on other factors. However, some tweets hint at potential issues like the stock getting ""ugly"" and suggesting it might be a bad investment. But overall, there's an expectation of positive trends and a lack of strong negative indicators.

So, considering all these points, there are mixed signals but with more positives than negatives. Therefore, I think the sentiment is neutral because while AMZN seems to be doing well and could go up, there are also signs that it might not perform as expected."
2014-05-29,Positive,"Alright, let's break down the analysis for determining the impact on the stock price of the company based on the provided tweets.

First, I need to identify the target stock. Looking through the tweets, it seems like 'amzn' is consistently mentioned as the target stock. So, the first step is clear— identifying that the target stock is Amazon (AMZN).

Next, each tweet plays a role in assessing factors and sentiment towards AMZN. Let's go through each tweet one by one.

1. **Tweet 1:** ""100 % computer generated real time unbiased trade alerts URL stocks $ aapl $ fb $ twtr $ goog $ amzn $ nflx $ mine $ dnax""  
   - This tweet is providing real-time unbiased trade alerts for multiple stocks, including AMZN. It seems to be confirming the stock's presence and not suggesting any changes in sentiment.

2. **Tweet 2:** ""are you looking for winners like $ wri $ lsi $ penn $ amzn singedinvestor URL""  
   - This is a request for investment strategies and mentions another stock, WRI. However, it doesn't provide any information about AMZN's performance or sentiment.

3. **Tweet 3:** ""get free research on $ hcn $ msft $ nyx $ amzn goto URL""  
   - Similar to tweet 2, this offers a service but again focuses on other stocks and not AMZN. No direct impact on sentiment towards Amazon here either.

4. **Tweet 4:** Same as tweet 1— providing real-time trade alerts for multiple stocks. It's a positive statement without any negative implications mentioned.

5. **Tweet 5:** ""fti do you think you should hold $ lpi $ emc $ amzn worth a look URL""  
   - Here, AMZN is included in the list of stocks being considered, but it's unclear if there are positive or negative factors. It seems to be a neutral request from a visitor about stock evaluation.

6. **Tweet 6:** ""100 % computer generated real time unbiased trade alerts URL stocks $ aapl $ fb $ twtr $ goog $ amzn $ nflx $ mine $ dnax""  
   - Again, AMZN is mentioned but again as part of the trade alert list without any sentiment analysis.

7. **Tweet 7:** ""$ amzn breaking out and has room""  
   - This tweet seems to indicate a positive outlook on Amazon's stock, suggesting it's poised for growth. It likely triggers positive sentiment from investors.

8. **Tweets 8-13:** These tweets are all about checking stock options positions on AMZN, mentioning various companies like PCLN, TSLA, MSFT, etc. They don't provide any direct information or analysis of the stock's performance, just an inquiry into options trading strategies.

9. **Tweets 8-13:** These are repeated versions where users check their stock positions on AMZN and other stocks. It doesn't indicate any positive or negative sentiment towards AMZN itself.

10. **Tweets 8-13:** Repeating the same, all pointing out their stock options without any engagement with the company's performance.

After analyzing each tweet, the main factors are:

- **Positive tweets (7):** A strong, confident statement about Amazon breaking out and having room, which can boost investor confidence.
- **Neutral tweets (1-6, 8-13, etc.):** These offer trade alerts without sentiment changes or direct investment advice.

Putting it all together, the majority of the tweets are positive and neutral, focusing on AMZN's potential for growth rather than any negative indicators. However, there is a clear mention of ""breaking out,"" which could slightly trigger some positive emotions but doesn't outweigh other signals.

Therefore, despite having mixed signals from various sources, especially the strong outlook from tweet 7, the overall sentiment remains positive."
2014-05-30,Positive,"Okay, I'm looking at this query where someone wants to analyze the impact of their tweets on a stock price and determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative. They provided 42 tweets related to Amazon (AMZN) stock, mostly about earnings reports, market trends, and options trading positions.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol. Scanning through the tweets, I notice mentions of ""amzn"", so that must be AMZN. Got it down.

Next, the user is doing a tweet-by-tweet analysis. Each tweet is either positive or negative regarding AMZN. They mention things like earnings reports and cloud offerings, which are usually good signs for future performance. So all these tweets seem positive because they're talking about upcoming events that could impact the stock.

I also look at factors: each tweet points out specific topics that could affect Amazon's performance, like their cloud services or financial results. Each of these points is a positive factor contributing to AMZN's potential success.

Then there are no negative sentiments here. All tweets are supportive and looking ahead, which suggests that the overall sentiment is positive. There's no mention of any pessimistic info, so I can safely say it's not negative. No controversial topics or warnings about the stock either; all focus on what might come in the near future.

I don't see any neutral elements here because every tweet is explicitly about AMZN being undervalued or expected to rise. There are no statements that would lean towards neutral behavior.

So, considering all of this—each tweet is positive, focusing on upcoming developments and potential gains—it makes sense that the overall sentiment for AMZN is positive."
2014-05-31,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets about the stock price impact on [Amazon.com Inc., or AMZN]. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I need to identify which tweet is relevant. It seems all of them mention the AMZN stock or related topics like financial news. So they are all potential indicators for AMZN's performance.

Now, looking at each tweet individually:

1. **tweet 1**: This one mentions $ dow amzn etc., and a newsletter with URL. I'm not sure what that newsletter is about. It could be something relevant to AMZN, but it's unclear without more context.
   
2. **tweet 2**: It talks about the top 25 tech companies founded by immigrants in the U.S. The tweet uses emojis like @uadrk and references a company or financial report. This seems like it's promoting AMZN among tech companies from different backgrounds, which might be a positive signal for investors.

3. **tweet 3**: It mentions ""top stocks today"" and asks to find out why $ slxp nvr stwd amzn worth a look. Maybe it's suggesting that AMZN is a good company to research or trade because of its popularity. This could align with the idea of bullish sentiment if investors believe in the stock's growth potential.

4. **tweet 4**: Talks about financial reports on HUB, IVZ, BIIB, and AMZN. It says must have URLs, which I assume are platforms for financial data. This might indicate a need to stay informed, suggesting that AMZN is essential information.

5. **tweet 5**: Discusses bullish sentiment towards UDR, KRO, MHK stocks, asking about $ udr kro mhk amzn click. Similar to tweet 4, it's promoting the stock and its relevance in the market.

6. **tweet 6**: Focuses on ""wow . great stock research on el cri dnr amzn financialnews."" It seems like AMZN is being studied or researched for financial news. This could be seen as positive if it highlights the company's importance in the industry.

7. **tweet 7**: Suggests buying, selling, or holding $ gmcr dov and am. GMCR is a tech stock, and Dov is a ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund). This could mean either support for AMZN or a mix of different investments.

Now, considering all these tweets, the main themes seem to be:

- Promoting AMZN among immigrants in tech.
- Encouraging research on AMZN's potential growth.
- Suggesting that AMZN is important in financial markets.
- Discussing stock reports and its relevance for investors.

From a sentiment standpoint, these tweets are encouraging investors to look into AMZN. They're talking about the stock's importance and possibly offering a platform or strategy. This positive promotion would likely lead to a positive overall sentiment among readers.

I should also consider if there are any conflicting or negative elements in the tweets. None seem to suggest negativity here; all point towards promoting AMZN and its growth opportunities."
2014-06-01,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on Amazon's stock price. So first, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""$ wat stock watchlist . dont be left behind $ amzn $ dal $ cag nasdaq URL"". Hmm, that doesn't seem like a stock symbol. Maybe it's a typo or something else. Let me check the next ones.

Next tweet is ""i don't believe in sector rotation-go long $ am zn"". Wait, I think there's an error here because one of the symbols is missing—Amzn should be AmZN. Then it says ""go long"", which might imply an investment strategy. But this seems too vague and not giving a clear stock symbol.

Third tweet: ""todays movers to research $ gd $ frt $ wmb $ am zn"". Again, same issue as before—it's missing the ending letter in AmZN. Maybe it was meant to be $ gd $ frt $ wmb $ amzn $ equity URL? If that's the case, then AMZN is involved.

Fourth tweet: ""$ am zn"": I think there's a typo here too. It should probably be ""amZN"" instead of ""am zn"". That would make the symbol AmZN, which stands for Amazon.

Fifth tweet: ""could be breaktout time on $ cop $ ugi $ cbg $ am zn"". The symbol in this case is AMZN again. So, it's about a potential breakthrough or breakout event on Amazon's stock price.

Sixth tweet: ""rt AT_USER mindblown : robots at work at amazon warehouses . $ am zn"": Here too, the symbol might be missing. It should probably be ""amzn"". That would refer to Amazon's stock.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because all these tweets are referencing Amazon stock symbols, but some have typos. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me assume that each tweet refers to a different stock, like AmZN or AMZN, and perhaps the hashtags or URLs are just additional information.

So, the targets would be Amzn (Amazon) from these tweets. Now, looking at each tweet's content:

1. It mentions ""don't be left behind"" and talks about staying informed, but it doesn't give much specific info on Amazon.
2. Talks about not believing in sector rotation and suggests going long, which could imply more investment strategies or views that might affect stock price unpredictably.
3. Discusses moving to a new area for research but again, not giving a clear picture of Amazon.
4. Says Amazon helps small publishers survive giants, which could be positive news as more companies are focusing on sustainability and smaller firms can compete, which sometimes benefits Amazon.
5. Talks about a potential breakout event for AMZN, suggesting something significant that might push the stock up.
6. Mentions Amazon warehouses in a ""mindblown"" way, implying excitement or maybe a product release, but again, not giving a clear stock information.

Putting this together, the tweets are talking about various aspects related to Amazon's stock, such as investment strategies, sector trends, company announcements, and possible events like a significant break. These are all factors that can influence investor sentiment and thus affect the stock price.

Positive factors here include mentions of new areas for research (which might mean more innovation, possibly good), companies like small publishers surviving giants (which can sometimes be positive for Amazon as it might expand into new markets or improve customer service). The mention of potential breakthroughs (like a breakout event) could imply that the stock is poised to rise.

Negative factors are less obvious. If any tweet were to suggest something bad, but here all seem to focus on positive developments.

So combining these thoughts, the sentiment seems mixed. There are some positive aspects like new research areas and expanding into smaller markets, but there's also a potential for an event that could impact the stock price negatively or positively. However, given the context of talking about AMZN and other related companies (like small publishers and warehouses), it's more likely that these tweets will encourage more investment in Amazon, which could lead to a positive overall sentiment.

Therefore, I think the overall sentiment is Positive because all the tweets are pointing towards various positive developments or strategies that could benefit Amazon's stock price."
2014-06-02,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out what the user is asking for here. So, there's a long conversation where someone is analyzing stock prices and doing some kind of analysis, probably related to stocks or financial reporting. The user provided an initial message with a bunch of commands about stock actions on Amazon (AMZN) and others like Apple (APL), Microsoft (MS), Google (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA). They're looking at various metrics like daily performance, technical indicators, and even some news announcements.

Then, the user wants me to take over this task. So, they provided a set of commands about AMZN, including things like whether it's in a ""competition edge ever closer"" or a specific disclosure report. I also see mentions of different companies like Tyc, which I'm not familiar with—maybe a typo? And there are some technical indicators mentioned: $ dpz wow . great stock research on $ amzn $ tyc $ grpn nasdaq URL—that seems to be a news article.

The output requirement is to conclude with a single line stating the overall sentiment using one of three tags: Positive, Neutral, or Negative. Alright, so I need to process all these commands and data points to determine the overall sentiment towards AMZN over time.

First, looking at the initial stock price movements. AMZN has been moving up quite a bit—150% in 20 days, with other companies like GOOG and TSLA also going up. The user mentions ""specialized disclosure report ( sd ) URL,"" which could be about news about a product or event. There's also a mention of a ""content hub"" focusing on children, which might indicate positive trends related to accessibility or child development.

However, there are some negative signs too. A red candlestick on AMZN’s chart suggests that while it's still rising, the price action is bearish. The user mentions that the price is hugging res, but I'm not sure what ""res"" stands for here—maybe a typo? If it's a positive trend, then it might be overbought or overvalued.

Looking at other companies: Aapl and Tsla are up 100%, which suggests strong performance. But if their stock isn't performing well relative to AMZN, it could indicate that they're in a different sector or product line. For example, Aapl being an Apple company might not necessarily be bad on its own unless related to competition.

The content hub focus on children is interesting because it shows positive trends towards younger audiences, but maybe at the expense of older products. This doesn't directly impact AMZN's sentiment but could influence consumer behavior indirectly.

There are no major negative news articles or updates mentioned, so that might mean the market is not overreacting to any significant events yet. However, given that AMZN has been a top performer in tech and other sectors, it seems like a strong indicator of positive sentiment from investors.

Putting this together: AMZN's stock is trending upwards but with some bearish signals due to the red candlestick. It's performing well against other companies, but there's room for uncertainty. However, overall, given the upward movements and positive trends despite some negatives, it seems like the market has a bullish angle.

I should make sure not to overstate the positivity and instead recognize that AMZN is in a good trajectory relative to its peers without significant headwinds. So, I'll conclude with a Positive sentiment tag."
2014-06-03,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the overall impact on Amazon's stock price based on the given tweets. The user provided a list of 39 tweets discussing a meeting where Amazon is being talked about in talks to buy $grpn groupon for $7 billion over $8 per share. 

First, let me look at each tweet individually. They all seem to be stating that Amazon's stock is expected to rise by $1 per share due to the upcoming transaction. That sounds pretty positive because it gives a concrete expectation of growth.

Each tweet mentions ""in talks"" and ""to buy,"" which suggests there's a meeting or discussion planned where they're buying more shares. This action usually implies optimism about future earnings and stock performance. 

I don't see any negative language, no mention of reducing the price, any concerns about profits being cut short, or any warnings about market fluctuations. Instead, all tweets are reinforcing that the expected change is an increase in Amazon's stock value.

So putting it together, each tweet is reinforcing a positive outlook on Amazon's stock. Therefore, aggregating these signals leads to an overall positive sentiment. The market expects Amazon's stock price to go up by $1 per share as part of their strategy."
2014-06-04,Positive,"Alright, let me break down how I approached this query. The user provided a list of messages and asked to conclude with a sentiment tag—Positive, Neutral, or Negative. 

First, I noticed that each message is a repetition of ""rt AT_USER $ amzn amazon in talks..."" followed by varying information about their purchase decisions. All the messages seem to state that they bought stock in Amazon.

Next, since every line ends with something like ""will $fbf...,"" it's clear the user has invested money into Amazon stock. There are no negative comments or any form of hesitation; all responses from the AT_USER explicitly indicate a positive action regarding their investment.

Therefore, I concluded that despite the repetitive and consistent nature of the messages, they all reflect a desire to invest positively in Amazon. This leads me to select ""Positive"" as the sentiment tag."
2014-06-05,Negative,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the overall sentiment based on all these articles about Amazon (AMZN) and other stocks. Let me start by reading through each article carefully.

First few articles are just repeating ""AMZN continues record highs..."" kind of stuff, talking about the economy and financial figures without adding much detail. Then there's something about jimmybob making some comments about AMZN and another company, which might indicate some negative thoughts but not enough to tip it yet.

The next couple mention $AMZN stocks trending higher on a large stock index called S&P 100. That sounds positive because it suggests that AMZN is doing well relative to others. But then there's this part where ""s & p100 stocks trend $amzn $gd $unp ..."", so maybe they're expecting AMZN to keep up with the market? Not sure if that's a positive or not, but I think it could be.

Then after a few unrelated articles about stock prices and news events, there are some technical analysis sections. One mentions that AMZN shares advanced 5.6% because of a new product launch on June 18th. That sounds like positive talk about growth and innovation, which is good for sentiment.

Wait, but I also see multiple ""RT AT_USER"" articles, which might be comments from users expressing their opinions or thoughts. For example, some mention feeling angry or upset, others are happy or enthusiastic. Some suggest that AMZN's stocks are on record highs and expect more growth. 

I need to consider all these factors. The positive trends like 5.6% growth in shares are strong, but there are also mentions of users expressing frustration, which can sometimes pull down the overall sentiment a bit. On the other hand, the continued positives from economic data and stock index movements might counterbalance that.

Hmm, I'm not sure if the frustration is enough to make it Negative or Neutral. Maybe it's in between? Or perhaps the positive trends are so strong that they outweigh the minor negatives? 

I should probably balance these factors. The main positive points are AMZN's technical analysis showing growth and users expressing enthusiasm. But there are also some negative comments about user sentiment, which might dilute the overall positive outlook.

In the end, I think the positive sentiment is leaning in a way that's not strong enough to be Negative, but it does have some room for Neutral because of the mixed user interactions."
2014-06-06,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to figure out their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

First tweet is just "" $ amzn i see a nice upside today..."" It says there's an upside, so probably positive. That seems positive about the company's performance.

Second tweet is a retweet of the first one. The user is talking about AT_USER adding money to Amazon and mentioning liquidity. Since it's about their own investment decision, I'm not sure how significant this is for the stock price. Maybe slight negative if they think it could hurt their portfolio, but generally positive sentiment from their own actions.

Third tweet is a report on $ mtd, $ vrsk, $ amzn, and $ intc all needing liquidity. If these are financial reports, there might be negative implications because companies often announce bad news with stock prices dropping. That could indicate a negative impact.

Fourth tweet is about $ avp, $ ebay, and $ intl needing more liquidity as well. Similar to the third tweet, this sounds like investors expect bad news, which would lead to negative sentiment for Amazon's shares.

Fifth tweet mentions a recommendation engine from Frank, emphasizing that it's casual but treats complexity at scale. The wording suggests they're concerned about how complex their product might be. This could be seen as negative because a better product might drive up prices and lower competition. But I'm not sure if it's enough to outweigh other factors.

Sixth tweet says Amazon is looking to enter the smartphone business. That's a positive sign for growth, especially in e-commerce. This is definitely positive about Amazon's expansion into new markets.

Seventh tweet mentions 3D phones being popular and everyone wanting them. If there's demand for this product line, it can boost sales and revenue, leading to an upward trend in the stock price.

Eighth tweet talks about Walmart wanting its money where its mouth is, which refers to putting its resources into e-commerce. This could be seen as positive because it aligns with Amazon's strategic goals, potentially driving growth and earnings.

Ninth tweet discusses $ qqq and $ nq_f targets for Amazon and a retake of their stock price. The ""long if"" part might indicate long-term expectations or confidence in future performance, which is typically positive for investors looking to buy.

Now, compiling all these factors:

- Positive tweets: 2 (first, seventh), 6 (sixth), 8 (eighth), and 9 (ninth). These are about growth, market expansion, and strategic moves that could increase revenue and earnings.
- Negative tweets: 3 (third) because liquidity is a common sell-off indicator. The fifth tweet's sentiment is unclear but might be seen as negative if they think their investment will go down.

So overall, there are strong positive signals from strategic investments and growth in the market. The only negative tweet is the third one, which has some uncertainty about liquidity. However, the other tweets suggest Amazon is expanding into new areas and responding to market needs. 

I'm leaning towards a slightly positive sentiment because the main positive factors outweigh the minor negative. But I should check if all positives are equally supportive."
2014-06-07,Positive,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock, which is Amazon since that's the most common symbol in the list: amzn. Now, looking at each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet says ""would you like great research on stocks $ amzn $ uhs $ swi $ fb goto URL"". Hmm, this seems like a request for research but not specifying what area. It might not directly influence Amazon's stock performance.

2. Next is ""get more info on $ cbi $ csl $ hcp $ am zn view now URL."" Again, this is another request for information on other companies, not specifically about Amazon. Not sure if that relates to the stock price of Amzn.

3. The third tweet is ""looking for research on $ q $ cli $ pra $ am zn liquidity URL."" This one mentions looking for research on companies like Q, CLI, and Pra with respect to Amazon's liquidity. Liquidity can affect investor sentiment, so maybe this could be positive because good liquidity might make Amazon more attractive.

4. The fourth tweet says ""$ amzn : walmart ’ s new c . e . o . stresses technology to improve customer service."" This sounds like a strategic update from Walmart about Amzn improving customer service due to their CEO's talk. While this is about Amzn, it doesn't mention any stock price changes or news that could directly impact Amazon's performance.

5. The fifth tweet is ""isrg stocks to watch this week $ r $ kors $ am zn give it a try URL."" This seems like a suggestion for investors to check out Isrg's stocks during the R & K sector, which often relates to consumer discretionary companies. Maybe positive if it attracts attention or investors.

6. The sixth tweet says ""stock market reports you need on $ adi $ lh $ str $ am zn stockmarket URL."" This is another inquiry about upcoming stock market reports for Amazon, not directly affecting the company's performance yet.

So putting this together: Some tweets are requests for information (tweets 2 and 3), some are strategic updates or suggestions to attract investors (tweets 4,5,6). The third tweet mentions ""liquidity,"" which could be positive if it improves, making Amzn more attractive. The fifth tweet is more about consumer discretionary stocks, which might not directly impact Amazon's stock.

But wait, Twitter can influence sentiment, especially through tweets with hashtags or discussions. If there are a lot of tweets promoting or discussing Amazon in relation to competitors or other companies, that could create buzz and potentially positive sentiment because it makes the company seem promising.

Also, sometimes social media sentiment peaks during earnings reports or news events. However, these tweets don't specify exact dates or details about Amazon's performance yet.

So maybe the overall sentiment is positive because of the strategic mentions and interest in related companies."
2014-06-08,Neutral,"Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has given me 15 tweets about Amazon stock and asks for an analysis of their likely impact on the future stock price, with a response of [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative].

First, I need to identify each tweet individually. For each one, I'll extract the stock symbol and then assess it. The stock seems to be AMZN.

Starting with the first tweet: ""sick and tired of losing money on $ cr $ has $ wwav $ amzn goto URL"". It mentions losing money, which is negative. So that's a strong indicator of negative sentiment.

Second tweet: ""stocks you might want to hold onto $ alsn $ amd $ iff $ amzn liquidity URL"". The user is advising holding stocks, which is generally positive for investor sentiment but doesn't directly mention losing money yet.

Third tweet: ""$ amzn next stop 337 URL"" - mentions future being great. This could be neutral because it's just a prediction without clear positives or negatives.

Fourth tweet: ""did you lose money on $ cbsh $ dtv $ cdns $ amzn stockmarket URL"". Again, directly mentions losing money, which reinforces the negative sentiment from the first tweet.

Fifth tweet: ""amazonfiretv amazon fire tv streaming box URL buy firetv & game controller amazon $ amzn firetv URL"" - promoting Amazon's products. While tech companies are usually positive, the product promotion is more about support rather than negative indicators.

Sixth tweet: ""small-cap stocks making 52 - wk highs $ amzn $ dbd $ dnkn $ ir click URL"". Small-cap stocks might be seen as potential buys but not necessarily all-positive. However, being in the tech sector could be neutral or mixed.

Seventh tweet: ""awesome stock research on $ tgt $ axs $ ati $ amzn overvalued URL"" - emphasizes researching and possibly selling if prices are high. Overvaluation can sometimes lead to sell pressure, contributing negatively to sentiment.

Eighth tweet: ""are you bullish on these stocks $ spg $ fnfg $ apam $ amzn overvalued URL"" - directly mentions being bullish, which is a positive indicator of investor confidence.

Ninth tweet: ""best pennystock research $ cah $ ndaq $ foxa $ amzn must see URL"" - promoting research and possibly being interested in it. That could be neutral or slightly negative if the user isn't actually doing anything with the stock.

Tenth tweet: ""rt AT_USER amazon's got a 3 - d threat . apple , watch your back $ amzn URL"" - talking about threats from Apple, which might indicate concern but not directly negative sentiment towards Amazon.

Eleventh tweet: ""are you bearish on these stocks $ mxim $ lvs $ cma $ amzn investing URL"" - clearly negative, indicating fear or concerns about the stock performance.

Twelfth tweet: ""is it breakout time on $ trn $ asna $ nav $ amzn economy URL"" - talking about economic factors. This could be neutral or slightly negative if the economy is expected to improve.

Thirteenth tweet: ""free research on $ clwr $ anat $ axp $ amzn overvalued URL"" - emphasizing research and possibly interest in Amazon's stock, which might contribute to positive sentiment but not necessarily.

Fourteenth tweet: ""latest information on stocks like $ amzn $ nsm $ cree $ feye singelinginvestor URL"" - mentions another tech company but doesn't directly mention losing money or other issues. It could be neutral if it's just about current news.

Fifteenth tweet: ""should you hold or add to $ tech $ atr $ alsn $ amzn worth a look URL"" - selling advice, which is more about what the user would do rather than stock performance.

Now, compiling all these, I see that the first tweet clearly states a strong negative impact. The fourth and tenth tweets mention losing money, adding pressure for negatives. The seventh tweet suggests overvaluation but might not directly cause it to be negative. The eleventh is definitely bearish. So overall sentiment seems mixed with some negative elements.

However, looking closely, most tweets are positive in terms of promoting Amazon or its products. The main issue is the loss of money. I'm leaning towards a mixed result because while some tweets have clear negatives, others like the fourth and tenth support positive outlooks but don't address the underlying cause."
2014-06-09,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their likely impact on the stock price of Amazon (AMZN). Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. **5 stocks you should be watching kqcom ce amzn check out URL**: This doesn't mention anything about AMZN's performance or positive/negative factors, so maybe this is neutral.
2. **siri whats going on with hsctrx amp amazon newsletter url**: Similar to the first one, no specific info on stock performance. It might be neutral again.
3. **amp $ amzn samuel jackson’s iconic performance of go the f * * k to sleep now available as a free audio download url**: This tweet is making an announcement about AMZN's performance and suggesting it's worth sleeping on. The mention of a ""free audio download"" could imply potential earnings, which might be positive.
4. **latest earnings info on csl luk te amp amazon wallstreet url**: Mentioning earnings could indicate future potential, possibly positive for the stock price.
5. **are you considering buying hftr hrb amzn singin investment URL**: This seems like a direct recommendation to buy AMZN. It's definitely a positive signal.
6. **our ap $ f $ spy calls rocklin hard lovin it url $ goog nflx fb vxx pcln gm tsla qqq spy amzn yy rio**: This tweet is making multiple announcements, but none specifically about AMZN except the part ending with $amzn. It's a mix of company news and possibly some unexpected developments. Maybe a mix of positive and neutral.
7. **avoid mistakes like rga cbst disca amp amazon singin investor URL**: Again, this seems like a reminder or warning against potential mistakes related to AMZN. This could be negative if it's misguiding people into risky actions.
8. **are you considering selling pcp str spls amzn try this url**: Similar to tweet 5, indicating a recommendation but not about the stock itself. It might still be positive because it's suggesting a decision.
9. **amp $ amzn inc ( nasdaq amzn ) threat for apple inc ( nasdaq aapl )’ s ... url**: This is about market rumors or predictions. If AMZN's performance could affect Apple, which has strong growth potential, this could lead to a positive impact on Amazon by creating uncertainty.
10. **get pennystock research on krft aeo trow amzn give it a try url**: This seems like a suggestion for investment. It might be positive as suggesting further action or consideration of AMZN.
11. **wmt expects 30% rise in e-commerce revenues this year URL by trefis team $ wmt amp $ cost**: This mentions Amazon's revenue growth, which could positively impact the stock price.
12. **nflx and amzn have seen two different scenarios play out in their options pits of late url**: Similar to tweet 6, multiple announcements but not about AMZN. It might be neutral because it's a general market view.
13. **csl pennystock research on unh pwr amp amzn research url**: Again, making an announcement about AMZN and possibly suggesting investment.
14. **should you hold or add to rok hfc hsic amp amzn try this URL**: Similar to tweets 5 and 8, indicating a recommendation but not specifically about the stock.

Considering all these points, most tweets are either positive (indicating potential performance, recommendations, or market developments) or neutral (just announcements without specific info). The one tweet that stands out is number 9, where Amazon's potential threat to Apple could have ripple effects. If AMZN's performance affects Apple, which has strong growth prospects, it might push the stock price up. However, there are other mixed signals about earnings and stock recommendations. Overall, the sentiment seems positive because multiple tweets suggest potential gains or investments."
2014-06-10,Negative,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about Amazon and its impact on their stock price. I'm new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, looking at each tweet:

1. ""This company just raised its dividend, but it won't help its stock."" So the user is saying they raised a dividend, but Amazon isn't going to see positive dividends right now. That suggests some good news about income, which usually can be seen as positive because companies want investors back.

2. ""$346 is coming,"" and ""buy your ticket Chuu."" The price target at $346 seems speculative, so maybe people are excited about buying, but without more info on the company, it's hard to say if that's a strong or weak signal.

3. ""$amzn savings on shipping on lawnmower and soundbar"" – I think Amazon is known for good shipping and product quality, so this positive tweet might boost sentiment positively.

4. ""starting to get interesting $qld $cat $mcig $xlf $amzn URL."" These are all stock symbols of different companies: QQT, cat, MCIG, XLF, AMZN. It looks like Amazon is getting some interesting news from other companies but not sure how it ties into their own stock.

5. ""subscribers saw our penny stock picks gain over 4,000% this year! subscribe today: URL $amzn $qcom $csco."" This seems to be encouraging subscribers by mentioning a significant increase in some penny stocks and inviting them to watch Amazon stock. Penny stocks are seen as undervalued, so a big gain might boost sentiment positively.

6. ""rt AT_USER ... crossfinder lts t/s buy, p/t 430 hft $pcln $bidu $fb $twtr $ tsla $pcln $amzn $aapl."" Again, multiple stock symbols here, and mentions of price targets like 430 and some high-frequency trading. It's a bit ambiguous without more context on the company or other factors.

Now, breaking it down:

- From tweet 1: Positive because dividend is good but not directly related to Amazon.
- Tweet 3: Strong positive note about shipping quality which could make Amazon perform better.
- Tweet 5: Encouraging subscribers for a big increase in penny stocks and promoting Amazon, which might have a positive impact.

But some tweets don't give enough information. For example, tweets 2 and 6 are speculative with unclear themes. They mention price targets but without context on the company's performance or other factors, it's hard to assess sentiment definitively.

Putting it together: There are mixed signals—some tweets suggest positive trends in stock performance (tweets 3,5) and others hint at potential gains without solid evidence (tweets 1,2,6). However, tweet 5 specifically mentions encouraging subscribers for a big penny stock increase, which is often seen as positive by investors.

So overall, the sentiment seems slightly positive because of the encouraging tweet, even though there are other factors that might be negative."
2014-06-11,Positive,"Okay, let's try to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. I'm not an expert in investing or analysis, but I'll go through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet says AMZN is now blocking pre-orders on its site because the user tried to order "" winter's tale , "" and Amazon has a $40 share. Hmm, that seems like negative news about their customer base. Maybe they're worried about demand or availability.
   
2. The second tweet mentions AMZN adding to Goldman Sachs' conviction buy list because they believe it can reach a bottom quartile of 4%. This sounds positive because it's building credibility with big financial institutions.

3. The third tweet is neutral. It clarifies how Goldman calculates ROIC, setting it at the bottom quintile of 4%. That's more like an opinion rather than affecting investor sentiment directly.

4. The fourth tweet suggests AMZN adding $40 to its conviction buy list after a 15% increase in two weeks. Positive because it shows growth and stability, which is good for investors.

5. The fifth tweet about Alibaba launching the U.S. shopping site on 11 main URL. I'm not sure what that means exactly, but maybe it's related to their online presence or user base. Not too clear yet.

6. The sixth tweet talks about AMZN not being a heavy doer since last week's grand slam. So if they didn't test the 338 resistance, which is a common support level, this could be negative because it's expected that something would come through.

7. The seventh tweet links to some top ten stocks for June 11th. It doesn't seem directly related to AMZN stock performance yet, so probably neutral or maybe a bit of a buzz.

8. The eighth tweet is similar to the fourth and fifth ones, discussing GM's stock. Positive because it shows growth potential.

9. The ninth tweet uses Twitter to mention different stocks like Facebook, Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, eBay, Amazon, Yell, Amazon, IBM, SPAC, Scrooge, etc. This seems more about information sharing than directly impacting AMZN's price.

10. The tenth tweet is about Bobirw, a bot trying to trade AMZN for $336. It doesn't mention anything relevant to AMZN stock performance, so maybe just spam or commentary.

11. The eleventh tweet brings up Pandora and Apple royalty payments being debated because the payments were considered too low. This could be negative news about their products or services.

12. The twelfth tweet suggests YELP and FB are doing well together, monitoring AMZN stock for a test. Positive because it shows diversification in their portfolio, which is good for diversification but not directly affecting their stock's price movement.

13. The thirteenth tweet talks about AMZN taking the top third of shares without a 66% increase. That seems negative because if they're doing well despite a moderate increase, it might indicate strong growth or management.

14. The fourteenth tweet is from StockTwits and mentions setting a price target for the year at $300 based on a 3D phone launch. This could be positive if the company is expected to achieve significant growth with this success.

15. The fifteenth tweet states that AMZN shares are increasing to $400. That's a strong push for the stock, which is likely positive news because it directly relates to price movement.

Now, let me summarize the overall sentiment. From 1-15 tweets, there are both positive and negative elements. Some tweets (like 2, 7, 8) show growth or positive announcements. Others like 4, 6, 9, 11, 13, 14 suggest potential for price increases based on market expectations. There's some uncertainty from the U.S. shopping site launch (5), conflicting news about GM (8), and concerns about Amazon's performance relative to past trends (6). However, the strong increase to $400 in tweet 15 seems like a clear signal to buy.

Wait, but I should consider how each tweet contributes. The positive tweets are building up confidence with GM and the new 3D phone, while negative ones are about potential growth or market movements. Since there's a mix of positive and potentially upcoming developments, it might not be purely positive or negative. However, the significant push to $400 in tweet 15 is strong evidence for a positive outcome.

But maybe some factors like the payment debate (9) could indicate instability, but the overall trend from 5 about the shopping site launch doesn't seem related. I'm leaning towards overall neutral because there are both favorable and unfavorable signals, but the strong push to $400 makes me think it's positive. But wait, tweet 13 mentions AMZN taking top third without a significant increase, which is negative.

I'm a bit torn here. Positive tweets are about growth (2,8,14), others about future directions or price targets (4,14). Negative tweets include the payment debate and the shopping site issue. The $400 push in 15 seems like direct positive news. Maybe the overall sentiment is positive because of this strong price increase."
2014-06-12,Positive,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how these tweets affect Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet one by one and see if I can determine if they're positive, negative, or neutral in terms of their impact on the stock.

First tweet: ""why amazon is willing to launch a half-baked music service $ amzn tech URL"". Hmm, this seems like Amazon is considering a new venture. They might be pushing ahead with a music streaming service, which could be a positive sign because more consumers are interested in streaming and entertainment. But I'm not sure if that's enough to tip the balance yet.

Second tweet: ""the rumors were true : URL inc . ( nasdaq : amzn ) introduces a new ... $ amzn URL"". If they're confirming details about their new music service, it reinforces their decision to launch something new. This could be positive because it confirms the project's viability and maybe aligns with broader consumer trends towards streaming.

Third tweet: ""$ amzn - early movers : lulu , fb , amzn , twtr , gs , jnj & more -> URL stock stocks stockaction"". Early movers are companies that have a good market position, like Amazon being an established company. This seems to suggest they're in a strong position to keep the stock action. So this looks positive.

Fourth tweet: ""are you looking for more winners like $ fds $ brkr $ all $ amzn overvalued URL"". The words ""more winners"" and ""overvalued"" are common negative terms that can indicate fear about returns. If consumers are scared they won't make money, it could hurt Amazon's stock. But maybe the mention of ""overvalued"" makes it a bit tricky.

Fifth tweet: ""$ amzn daily - price still battling resistance . fibonacci supt / res levels URL"". This seems technical but suggests that Amazon's price is being pushed up by support levels or something related to Fibonacci retracement, which could be seen as a bearish signal. But I'm not too sure about this one.

Sixth tweet: ""$ cnqr free research on $ hxl $ twx $ amzn economy URL"". Free research and new products can sometimes attract investment, but it's not clear if that's positive or negative for Amazon's stock. It might be a mixed bag depending on what the company is doing with those products.

Seventh tweet: ""$ drys stock chart $ drys most recent stock chart and technical analysis . $ amzn $ sina $ btu $ ibb $ bidu $ swks http URL"". Technical stuff like price charts can show support or resistance, but without context, it's hard to tell if this is positive or negative. Maybe a mix?

Eighth tweet: ""$ amzn : ' lego movie ' caught in amazon's battle with warner home video URL"". The inclusion of ""lego movie"" could attract fans and potentially boost sales. It might create buzz but not necessarily lead to a significant price movement.

Ninth tweet: ""AT_USER smartertrader sam must know someone upstairs in $ amzn last week got phone news in amzn this week , got gs buy . $ fb new hire !"". Positive words about a user interacting with the company could be a boost, like mentioning a hiring. Maybe positive sentiment from customer interactions.

Tenth tweet: ""buy or sell ? $ cbsh $ klac $ thc $ amzn wallstreet URL"". This is more of a question. I'm not sure what these stocks represent, but it seems to be about potential investment decisions. If the user is undecided, it might cause some mood swings but I can't predict a definite impact.

Eleventh tweet: ""amazon launches music streaming for prime members URL"". This clearly states their intention to launch a new service. It's a significant positive sign because more consumers will have access to music streaming, which can drive demand and increase stock value. That sounds like a strong positive.

Twelfth tweet: ""$ amzn happy birthday to us ! a look back at market musings as i sent in yesterday ’ s “ market musings , ” something o ... URL"". A birthday tweet with mentions of past messages could be a happy note, but it's unclear if this affects the stock directly. It might just be a casual update without any direct implications.

Thirteenth tweet: ""rt AT_USER . AT_USER loves local , but it absolutely shouldn't : URL $ amzn"". This seems like advice from a user promoting Amazon's brand. It could either be positive (if encouraging to shop locally) or negative if misinterpreted as encouraging theft or something else, which is not good for the company. I'm unsure here.

Now, let's summarize my thoughts. Some tweets are positive because of actual projects or new services like music streaming. Others mention buzzwords and investors' reactions, but without specific data on sentiment. A few tweets offer advice to avoid negative things, which could be more neutral or even slightly negative if the advice is harmful. The rest are medium positives from actual business moves.

So putting it all together, while there's some positive news about new services, others are mixed in terms of investor sentiment and brand reputation. It might not be a clear overall positive or negative but leans towards positive because of the expected projects and potential increased demand."
2014-06-13,Positive,"Alright, so I have to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on Amazon's future stock price and then decide if it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the target stock is Amazon, with the symbol AMZN. So I'll focus on the given tweets related to AMZN.

Looking at the first tweet: ""$ trw keeping my eye on $ rf $ xrx $ amzn click URL"". Hmm, ""trw"" stands for Twitter's retweet count. They're keeping their eye on Rf and X rx stocks and mentioning Amazon by clicking a URL. Retweets can indicate investor interest or sentiment towards the stock, but without specific information on positive or negative aspects, it's hard to assess.

The second tweet: ""is it breakout time on $ sm $ ggp $ cah $ amzn must have URL"". Again, using hashtags like SM, GGP, CAH. These could be abbreviations for different metrics, maybe stock prices or some financial indicators. If these are indicative of potential price movements, they might influence investor sentiment.

Third tweet: ""$ morn whats going on with $ sfg $ wpo $ amzn equity URL"". The mention of SFG and WPO suggests something about the company's operations or strategic moves. But without knowing if it's positive or negative, hard to tell.

Fourth tweet: ""$ dv are you looking for winners like $ bmc $ yhoo $ amzn economy URL"". Using BDC, YOO, AMZN in a positive context might imply they're searching for good value stocks in the economy. This could influence investor sentiment positively if they see it as an opportunity.

Fifth tweet: ""$ ace small-cap stocks making 52 - wk highs $ orcl $ jec $ amzn give it a try URL"". Small-cap stocks usually have higher volatility and risk, so mentioning them as having high highs could be concerning. If AMZN is giving them a try, it might attract investors expecting good growth.

Sixth tweet: ""$ amzn : amazon launches prime music , a free streaming service for prime subscribers URL"". This mentions Prime Music, which is a streaming platform. The launch of a free service to Prime subscribers could be seen as expansion or support of the company's product line, potentially increasing demand and thus investor sentiment towards Amazon.

Now, combining all these thoughts: The first tweet might have some retweets but without specific info on sentiment. The second could be about potential price movements. The third is about a strategic move by SFG/WPO. Fourth suggests they're looking for winners in the economy. Fifth talks about giving small-cap stocks a try which might attract investors. Sixth mentions Prime Music, which is related to content distribution.

Overall, while some tweets indicate investor interest or potential expansion, others are more speculative with no clear sentiment. But given that the sixth tweet specifically refers to content distribution and a free service, it could positively influence AMZN's stock price by attracting new users and increasing demand. So I think there's a positive impact here."
2014-06-14,Positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out how these tweets impact Amazon's future stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, each tweet is separate, but they all mention ""Amazon."" That gives me a starting point because the company is the main focus here. 

Looking at tweet 1: It says something about buying $HME and $TDW, which are other companies, not Amazon. Maybe this isn't directly related, so I'll have to ignore it for now.

Tweets 2, 3, 4, and 5 all mention Amazon or its stock, specifically $AMZN. So the focus is on Amazon's performance. 

In tweet 2, there are mentions of tech stocks with a 7.51% average gain in one month. I know that tech stocks can be volatile, so this suggests some positive sentiment about tech companies.

Tweets 3 and 4 talk about Amazon entering into payments, which could indicate expansion or strategic moves. Payments are a big area for tech companies to enter the fintech space.

Tweet 5 mentions stock action with $AMZN in quotes, which is likely from a social media post that suggests investors might buy it now, possibly due to positive outlooks.

Considering all these, while some tweets suggest tech growth and payments potential, overall sentiment leans towards positive because Amazon's position in tech is a significant concern. However, there are other factors like payments and market expansion, which could be mixed signals.

But looking at the output requirements, I need to summarize the overall impact. There's a mix of positive notes from tech stocks and broader investment optimism about Amazon. However, if it's mostly tech-related with some other areas considered, maybe the negative isn't dominant here. So, leaning towards a Positive overall sentiment."
2014-06-15,Neutral,"Okay, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of spy. The user provided five tweets, each discussing different stocks or events related to Amazon. I need to go through each tweet one by one, extract the target stock symbol, identify positive and negative factors from each tweet, assess the sentiment towards that stock, and then combine all this information into a single conclusion.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""markets overview updated on * * * the magic portfolio * * $ spy $ iwm $ qqq $ dia $ sbux $ amzn $ gs $ pcln URL URL"". Hmm, it mentions several stocks like spy, iwm, qqq, etc. Since we're focusing on spy specifically, maybe this tweet is a bit too broad and doesn't directly mention spy. But if I take it at face value, the only stock mentioned is spy. So for this tweet, the positive factors might be about market overview updates, which can provide context or insights into the company, and negative could be unrelated mentions of other stocks. However, since spy isn't explicitly mentioned beyond being in the list, it's hard to tell if that affects its sentiment.

Moving on to the second tweet: ""how amazon could attack android $ amzn URL"". Here, it directly mentions amzn, which is Amazon. The tweet talks about how Amazon might attack Android, which relates to tech sectors. But since we're focused on spy, this tweet doesn't mention spy at all. So again, it's unclear if this affects spy.

Third tweet: ""$ vmw stock market reports on stocks like $ amzn $ see $ chtp singlin investorurl"". This mentions vmw and other companies but not spy. It seems to be discussing a broader market context with various companies, so maybe no direct impact on spy here either.

Fourth tweet: ""$ amzn if 323.39 can hold . that is key level"". Here, the tweet is about Amazon holding at $323.39 and refers to it as a ""key level."" This sounds like technical analysis or stock trading, which affects investor sentiment towards Amazon but not necessarily spy directly.

Fifth tweet: ""$ krc get research on $ sc $ vrsn $ amzn must see url"". Again, this mentions krc (maybe an unrelated company), sc, vrsn (which I think is a typo for valence network or something else), and amzn. So no direct mention of spy here either.

Putting it all together, each tweet is discussing different companies related to Amazon but not specifically focusing on spy. There are no clear positive or negative factors mentioned that directly impact spy's stock price. The information provided seems more about broader tech sectors or technical aspects rather than specific company performance or market trends.

Therefore, I can't find any positive, neutral, or negative factors pointing towards or against spy. It looks like all the tweets are either discussing unrelated companies or providing general market context without giving a clear direction on how that affects spy's stock."

2014-06-17,Missing,File not found
2014-06-18,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. So, the user has given me several tweets related to Amazon and their new product, an ""fire phone."" They want me to determine if each tweet is positive, neutral, or negative in terms of impact on Amazon's stock price.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at the tweets, I see one with ""$ amzn"" which clearly refers to Amazon. So, I'll focus on those 20 tweets that mention $ amzn.

Now, for each tweet, I have to break it down into factors and assess sentiment. The user provided a step-by-step process: identify the target stock, analyze each relevant tweet by separating factors (positive/negative) and evaluating sentiment, then combine these to get an overall sentiment.

Starting with tweet 1: It's about Amazon revealing they'll unveil a 3D smartphone tomorrow. Positive because releasing new tech can boost stock price.

Tweet 2 continues the story from tweet 1, reinforcing the positive outcome of the phone launch.

Tweets 3 and 4 mention Jeff bezos talking about the phone but don't provide specific information beyond what's stated before. Still positive as it's a breakthrough in their product line.

Tweet 5 repeats tweet 3 or 4 with the same info without adding anything new, so I'll keep it positive.

Tweets 6 and 7 discuss the phone launch timing, which is bad news because companies often have public schedules that can affect investor confidence. This negative timing can lead to a decrease in stock price.

Tweets 8-10 mention CEO talking about dynamic perspective but don't provide much detail on pricing or plans. So, not too positive but some indication of moving forward.

Tweets 11 and 13 are all from other users sharing similar info without adding anything. Neutral because they're just providing the same information to different followers.

Tweets 12 calls for shorting Amazon again due to its recent gains. That's negative as it's a sell strategy, but I need to see if this is in response to the tweets about the phone or unrelated.

Tweets 13-15 are about the price movement and another quote from bezos. The one after tweet 6 is the same as tweet 5, so no change.

Tweet 16 mentions when Amazon will unveil the smartphone in June, which is further away than previously mentioned tweets. While it's important, it's still not too far behind, but the main focus was on the release date being extended or changed. So, this might be considered neutral because it doesn't add a major update to their product.

Tweet 17 talks about Amazon's stock performance, which is positive as it provides investors with data point. Still positive since it's about the stock moving up.

Tweets 18-20 discuss licensing agreements and other details that don't provide immediate news related to the phone launch. So, neutral because they're just mentioning ongoing efforts without specific info on stock performance.

Putting it all together: most tweets are either positive or neutral. There's some negative tweet about the timing of the phone launch, but overall sentiment is generally positive with a touch of uncertainty from the extended timeline and some sell strategies."
2014-06-19,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of Amazon (AMZN). Let me go through each tweet step by step.

Starting with tweet 1 and 2: They all mention a huge user buying lots of shares in AMZN. That sounds like a lot of positive sentiment because users are investing a significant amount, which can drive up the stock price. The terms ""huge buying"" and ""right now!"" suggest they're acting confidently, so that's a good sign.

Tweets 3-6: They also mention the same user buying shares but with different hashtags like fb, twtr, etc. This consistent buy-sell behavior usually means investors are optimistic about the stock. The repetition in hashtags might make it sound more aggressive and positive.

Tweets 7 onwards: These seem to bring some criticism or confusion. Some mention that Amazon is taking too much time to gain share value, like piper jaffray's feedback saying they'll take time. This could indicate potential negatives if the user thinks the stock won't move quickly enough or there are other factors affecting its performance.

Tweets 8 and 9: They talk about fire phones being unique but not necessarily a good thing. Fire Phone is Amazon's new product, so mentioning it as 'not necessarily' adds some skepticism because even the latest tech can face challenges like lower sales or market acceptance.

Tweets 10-23: These are more positive and mention other financial news related to AMZN. Statements about making profits from long-term investments and talking to Coachesroster (which I think is Amazon's CEO) further support a positive outlook. They're discussing future plans, which can influence investor sentiment.

The overall picture seems like a mix of positives and some negatives. The repeated buy-sell behavior on the first six tweets gives strong positive signals. But the criticism about product uniqueness and potential delays in growth could be seen as mixed or slightly negative. However, it's hard to say if all these factors cancel each other out.

Looking at tweet 23, which mentions goog l company dominating smartphone industry, suggests that AMZN might not be the only player but more dependent on them. That could cause some skepticism because a major competitor might take over quickly, leading to uncertainty in Amazon's performance.

In summary, while there are mixed reactions, the majority of tweets support buying shares, and it's likely boosting the stock price positively. The other negative points don't outweigh the positives enough to make it neutral."
2014-06-20,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and figure out their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the target stock is Amazon, symbol AMZN. Now, looking at each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet says ""am zn amazon's strategy : exploit your brand-name power URL."" I think this means they're using their brand name to make a claim or move somewhere. It sounds positive because it's about brand positioning and possible expansion.

2. The second tweet is ""$ am zn bezos : fire phone offers ' something different '
"" This seems like a statement about Bezos, the CEO of Amazon. If Bezos is being mentioned, that might indicate some positive attention since he's a big executive. It could be a positive signal for Amazon's performance.

3. The third tweet is ""$ am zn 321.52 URL."" The number might just be a random figure or perhaps a typo. I don't have context here to assess its impact yet, but it's unclear if this relates to stock price.

4. The fourth tweet mentions that Amazon is blocking some book publisher titles related to J.K. Rowling's latest book. It says they make an exception for another author. This could be seen as negative because Amazon's policies might affect their sales or reputation.

5. The fifth tweet has a series of URLs: ""$ am zn rsh $ shld $ wmt URL."" These look like stock ticker symbols, which don't directly relate to AMZN unless there's a typo or another company mentioned here.

6. The sixth tweet says ""can a leopard change its spots ? $ am zn and the new kindle fire phone URL."" Leopards can't change their spots naturally, but this seems like a humorous statement. It could be trying to highlight that Amazon is still focusing on tech companies regardless of their species, which might not impact the stock price negatively.

7. The seventh tweet: ""$ am zn 2 examples that prove you should buy the rumor , sell the news URL."" Again, numbers and phrases here are unclear. Proving your need for information and selling it could be seen as aggressive marketing tactics, potentially negative for Amazon if it leads to competition or poor brand image.

8. The eighth tweet: ""rt AT_USER lotta ppl juked into an $ am zn long ... even fundies getting in on the smartphone hype . shit is gettin plastered ."" This sounds like users are reacting positively when a famous person, maybe Elon Musk? It's talking about community reactions and funding for smartphones. If people are supporting and investing, it could be positive but might lead to more competition or lower margins.

9. The ninth tweet: ""rt AT_USER fire phones are the 2 best-selling ' contract cell phones ' on URL ( galaxy s5 is 3 ) $ am zn URL."" Fire phones being top selling tech devices might influence consumer sentiment. If demand is strong, Amazon could see increased sales, which would be positive.

Now, combining all these factors: Brand positioning and Bezos mention are positive. The number in the fourth tweet could be a data point or typo. The leopard spot humor doesn't seem impactful. Fire phones' performance suggests positive market reactions. So overall, it seems like Amazon is doing well, especially with their tech product sales and consumer interest."
2014-06-21,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. So, first, I need to understand what each tweet is saying.

The first tweet is ""looking for the next winners like $ urbn $ msft $ he $ amzn research URL"". Hmm, it looks like there's some placeholder numbers and words like 'winners' mentioned. The terms 'urbn' and 'msft' are likely company names, maybe Apple or Alphabet Inc., since those are common stock ticker symbols. Similarly, 'amzn' is Amazon, a big tech company.

So, the user is looking for the next winners among these companies. That's probably encouraging investors to look ahead at upcoming research and could indicate optimism towards their future performance. They're seeking information on potential upcoming projects or developments that might boost the stock prices of these companies. This suggests confidence in the potential gains but maybe with some uncertainty.

Next, I should break this down into steps as outlined: identify the target stock, analyze each tweet, assess sentiment, and then combine everything for the overall impact.

1. **Identify the Target Stock**: The tweets mention $ urbn $ msft $ he $ amzn research URL. Since these are placeholders, without knowing which ones correspond to specific stocks, it's a bit tricky. But I can assume each of these is a company ticker and the user is looking for their upcoming research.

2. **Tweet-by-Tweet Analysis**: The tweet seems to be encouraging investors by mentioning 'winners' and 'research URL.' It doesn't provide any specific information about the stocks, so it's more of a call to action rather than giving details on what they should focus on. But maybe it implies that they're seeing potential growth areas or products coming up.

3. **Assess Sentiment**: The language here is generally positive and optimistic. Words like 'winners', 'research', and 'future' suggest a belief in the company's potential performance. However, there are some placeholders involved, so the sentiment might be a bit vague but leaning towards optimism.

4. **Overall Sentiment Summary**: Combining all these elements, it seems that while the tweet is not providing concrete information or stock details, the positive language and call to action imply that investors are optimistic about upcoming developments. This could lead to an increase in interest in the stocks, potentially affecting their price movements.

But wait, I need to be careful here. The use of placeholders like 'urbn' and 'msft' doesn't necessarily mean specific companies. It's more about the user's intention to look for potential winners. So, it might not directly indicate a stock's performance but could attract investors to research them further.

Also, the mention of 'he' at the end is concerning because that could be an email from someone who might be trying to sell or push investment strategies, which could lead to negative sentiment if they're pushing the stock too hard without providing details.

Putting it all together: There's some positive language encouraging investors, but there are also placeholders and a possible selling message. The overall sentiment is likely mixed because while optimism is in play due to future-looking research, the presence of unverified information could lead to skepticism. However, since the user is looking for winners, they might be signaling interest rather than potential losses.

Therefore, I think the sentiment is neutral because there's a positive indication towards growth but also some uncertainty from the placeholders and possible selling intent."
2014-06-22,Missing,File not found
2014-06-23,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided two tweets and specified the steps to take: identify the target stock, separate positive and negative factors, assess sentiment, and then summarize overall sentiment.

First, I should figure out which stock is being referred to by these tweets. Looking at the first tweet: ""still playing $ tsla $ scty $ gwph $ twtr and recent momo - momentum continues up as $ aapl $ goog $ amzn slip back . do it until it stops working"". Hmm, those look like company names. So maybe the stock is either Tesla (TSLA), SCTY, GWPH, or TWTR. The user might be referring to one of these companies.

The second tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ amzn offering developers $ 5k in its amazoncoin virtual cash to lure them to its firephone . URL"". This seems like a direct offer from Amazon (AMZN) for developers using their services, promising to provide virtual cash to attract users to their fire phone. This could be a positive sign as it might encourage user engagement and possibly lead to more sales.

Now, step by step:

1. Identify the Target Stock: I need to figure out which stock is being referred to. The first tweet mentions companies like Tesla, SCTY, GWPH, TWTR, APEX (from APTX), and AMZN. So there are multiple stocks involved here. Without more context, it's a bit ambiguous. Maybe the user is referring to one of these companies.

2. Tweet-by-Tweet Analysis:
   - For each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors.
     - Tweet 1: It mentions momentum continuing up due to APEX slips back and offers developers incentives. So positive factors here are momentum and the developer incentives. The mention of ""momentum continues up"" suggests a potential positive trend. Negative factors could be the uncertainty around the slips back but less likely if it's not affecting current performance.
     - Tweet 2: It's an Amazon offer, which is usually good news for any company as it can attract users and increase sales. So positive factor here is the developer incentive (5k) and the direct mention of Amazon's offering.

3. Assess Sentiment:
   - Tweet 1 is more about a future expectation from APEX and the developer incentives. The user is encouraging users to stay until the project stops working, which could indicate interest in the project but not necessarily positive for the stock.
   - Tweet 2 is definitely positive with Amazon's direct offer.

4. Overall Sentiment Summary:
   - Tweet 1 has some mixed signals with a bit of uncertainty (APEX slipping back) and clear developer incentives, which are usually positive but may lead to confusion about project timelines.
   - Tweet 2 is clearly a good move for Amazon, increasing visibility and revenue.

Considering all factors, the overall sentiment seems moderately positive because one tweet provides an explicit benefit to Amazon, while the other has mixed signals. However, the developer incentive could be viewed as speculative or uncertain rather than certain positive. So perhaps the impact isn't overwhelmingly positive but it's a good sign worth considering."
2014-06-24,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative for the stock price impact. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

Starting with the first tweet: ""$ gdx hitting buzz $ ipci $ lnkd $ cara $ gmcr $ amzn URL"". Hmm, it mentions several sectors like GDX, IPCI, LNKD, GMCR, and AMZN. These could be investment vehicles or ETFs. The word ""hitting buzz"" might indicate that the tweet is talking about something growing in popularity, which usually means a positive sign for investors. So I'll mark this as Positive.

Next, the second tweet: ""$ amzn - amazon inks content deal with aardman animations -> URL stock stocks stockaction"". This one starts with an Amazon tweet where they mention a content deal with AARDMAN. That sounds like a significant event that could boost their stock price. The use of ""inked"" implies connection or agreement, which is positive for investors looking to capitalize on this development. So this should be Positive.

Lastly, the third tweet: ""$ amzn amazon close to resolving pricing dispute with warner bros : wsj URL"". Here, Amazon and Warner Bro are mentioned as parties involved in a conflict. Resolving such disputes can affect their revenue or stock price. However, since it's just a minor detail, it might not have a huge impact on the overall stock performance. So I'll categorize this as Neutral.

Adding them all up: Positive (1), Positive (2), Neutral (3). The overall sentiment seems to be mixed but leaning more towards positive because two out of three tweets are favorable."
2014-06-25,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually.

The first tweet says: ""$ amzn - get ready to do your saving and investing , alongside spending , at amaz ... -> URL stock stocks stockaction"". Hmm, that looks like a link or maybe some kind of social media post promoting Amazon. It seems like it's offering advice on saving, investing, and spending, which are positive indicators for investors because they're encouraging people to make money.

So the positive factors here would be about maximizing returns through saving and investing. The negative factors don't seem present in this tweet, so that tweet might have a strong positive impact by promoting Amazon as a good stock to invest in.

Looking at it again: It's a link that seems promotional, suggesting that AMZN is a good candidate for investment or growth. Therefore, the overall sentiment should be positive because the tweet is encouraging positive actions and promotes Amazon."
2014-06-26,Negative,"Okay, so I have to analyze these tweets about the stock price of Amazon. Let me start by breaking down each tweet and see what they're saying.

The first tweet is "" $ trw are you looking for winners like $ jcp $ anss $ amzn nse URL"". Hmm, this seems a bit confusing. It mentions ""winners"" but with some weird symbols like JCP and AMZN. Maybe it's asking if the stock is a winner? The mention of NSE could be referring to Indian exchanges or something related.

The second tweet says ""$ amzn at & t tells us lawmakers directv deal is not comcast / time warner URL"". This one is more specific. It mentions ""at & t"" which might stand for AT&T. The tweet talks about a lawmakers deciding that a deal isn't from Comcast or Time Warner. If this affects Amazon, it could be a negative news because if the government decides to remove their services, it might impact Amazon's business operations and revenue.

The third tweet is ""paul vogel at barclays initiates on $ amzn with a neutral URL ..."". Paul Vogel from Barclays initiating on Amazon without specifying how. A neutral initiation could mean that the news isn't favorable or positive for Amazon yet.

Lastly, the fourth tweet is ""$ amzn just a thought . URL"". It seems like another vague tweet, maybe in the context of a thought experiment about Amazon's performance.

Now, putting this together: The tweets are mostly in the realm of politics and government decisions. There's mention of lawmakers deciding not to support certain companies' deals. These kinds of news usually affects investors because companies that comply with government regulations often see their stock prices impacted. If the tweet indicates that a government is blocking a deal for Amazon, it could lead people to think about the company negatively.

I should consider if these statements directly suggest positive or negative actions. The first tweet's lack of clarity on the topic might make it difficult to assess definitively, but the others involve government intervention and legal considerations which are generally viewed as negative by the stock market. Therefore, combining all these factors, it seems like there could be a negative impact on Amazon's stock price."
2014-06-27,Negative,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. The user provided a list with symbols like AMZN (Amazon). So, the stock in question is Amazon. 

Now, for each tweet, I'll separate them into Positive and Negative factors based on what's mentioned about Amazon. Then, I'll assess if each tweet influences investor sentiment.

Looking at the first tweet: ""stocks to hold onto $ i eog mrk amzn stockmarket url"". It mentions holding onto stocks but doesn't specify whether it's positive or negative. I'm not sure about this one yet.

The second tweet says: ""yup doesn't look pretty down here , staying short"". This seems like a strong negative sentiment because it suggests that Amazon is underperforming, so staying short could be good advice for investors.

Third tweet: ""todays stocks you should watch $ afg ter cxw amzn stockmarket url"". The wording here is vague. It doesn't mention if Amazon is going up or down; it's just suggesting to watch certain stocks. So this might not contribute much unless more context is available.

Fourth tweet: ""communally, commented on stocktwits : so far this year wall st has cared about earnings . amzn down 18 % ytd , market at all time ..."". This one gives concrete information that Amazon's stock is down 18% and mentions earnings. It also says the market is still up. The mention of Earnings could be a positive point if it indicates better conditions, but the overall trend is downward, so the sentiment seems negative.

Now, compiling this: There are mixed signals here. Some tweets are very vague, like the first one, while others give clear data points. Most tweets suggest that Amazon's performance is underperforming (either by price or earnings), and some even recommend shorting.

The key indicators from the fourth tweet are a significant downward percentage change in Amazon's stock. Combined with positive mentions of earnings, which might be misleading, it leans towards a negative sentiment.

Putting this together, most tweets point to a general negative outlook for Amazon. So, overall, I think the sentiment is Negative."
2014-06-28,Positive,"Alright, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine their likely impact on the stock price of a company. Let me take it step by step.

First, each tweet seems to be part of a stock analysis. The target stock is probably one of them since they have symbols like $wcn, $amzn, etc. But without knowing which company, I might need to assume or look for patterns.

Looking at the first tweet: ""are you hanging on to $ wcn $ hcbk $ tsla $ amzn worth a look URL"". It mentions other stocks and says URL is important. This could be about stock research or viewing options, so it's definitely positive because it's encouraging users to check out other companies.

The second tweet is: ""$ amzn news alert : URL updated options view : URL all options views : URL"". It seems like an alert for Amazon (AMZN) with links and ""URL"" repeated. Alerts usually mean that there might be a change in the stock price, so it's positive as it suggests immediate action could lead to a change.

Third tweet: ""rt AT_USER go on . try quitting amazon prime . bet you can't URL $ amzn"". It uses emojis and suggests quitting Amazon Prime but points out AMZN. This is a bit vague, but the mention of AMZN could indicate either positive or negative, depending on context. However, since it's an offer to quit a service, maybe it's seen as something good or not so clear.

Fourth tweet: ""$ vtr some stocks to watch $ mpc $ dell $ amzn liquidity"". It mentions VTR and suggests watching certain stocks for liquidity. Liquidity is important because it affects how easy a stock can be bought or sold, which impacts investor sentiment. So this seems positive.

Fifth tweet: ""looking for the next winners like $ ebay $ jazz $ hban $ amzn personalfinance URL"". This is about identifying winners in the market. Positive because it's proactive and seeking potential gains, suggesting optimism.

Sixth tweet: ""stock watchlist . dont be left behind $ gef $ wynn $ amzn $ lgnd must have URL"". It's about a stock watchlist but mentions multiple companies. While watchlists can affect prices, without specifics on how they're doing, it's ambiguous. Could be positive or negative.

Seventh tweet: ""looking for research on $ de $ unp $ away $ amzn research"". Similar to the fifth tweet, this is about researching something related to AMZN. Positive because research can influence investor decisions and stock price movements.

Eighth tweet: ""$ dpz wow . great stock research on $ chh $ gxp $ amzn liquidity URL"". Again, similar structure to previous positive tweets, suggesting interest in a stock's research which affects price.

Putting it all together, each tweet is encouraging users to check various stocks or watch lists. It's not entirely clear if the positive or negative aspect dominates here, but considering that some are about alerts, others are about watching and researching, there might be mixed sentiment. However, since many are promoting AMZN directly or suggesting other companies, it leans more positive overall."
2014-06-29,Neutral,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative in impact on the stock price for the given company. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

Starting with the first tweet: ""great stock newsletter on $ cag $ brkr $ rkt $ amzn economy rate_limit_exceeded"". The word ""rate_limit_exceeded"" caught my eye because it relates to some kind of limitation or potential issue in their economy or something. I'm not entirely sure what that means, but it could be a sign that they're taking steps towards improvement or maybe considering expansion. It's vague, so I can't tell for sure if it's positive or negative. Hmm.

Moving on to the second tweet: ""buy or sell ? $ lii $ m $ acgl $ amzn nasdaq URL"". This seems like it's from a buy/sell predicting forum. The word ""url"" is there too, which might be a placeholder for a URL where they can find information about buying or selling the stock. Since it's a question with a prediction element, it suggests that people are either planning to buy or sell now. Without more details, I'm not sure if this is positive or negative because it could lead investors towards taking action right now. Maybe in the short term, but not sure for long-term impact.

The third tweet: ""are you considering buying $ lo $ jec $ apd $ amzn view now URL"". Similar to the second one, this seems like a prediction about whether someone is looking to buy. Again, it's using a URL placeholder and asking if they're planning to buy. Like the previous tweet, without knowing the future implications, I can't be certain about the sentiment.

The fourth tweet: ""should you hold or add to $ acc $ gps $ hcn $ amzn must see URL"". This is another prediction thread. It's suggesting whether holding or adding a stock is in order and mentions that they should see more info. Once again, it's speculative and without knowing if this leads to buy/sell decisions, I can't assess the sentiment as positive, neutral, or negative.

Finally, the fifth tweet: ""avoid mistakes like $ sfg $ aiz $ hxl $ amzn wealthmanagement URL"". Again, a prediction about avoiding mistakes in their wealth management. This could mean that they're cautious about potential pitfalls but don't give any specific reasons why the stock might go up or down. It's more of a precautionary note rather than an influencing factor.

Putting it all together, all five tweets are from prediction forums where people are planning to buy or sell the stock based on certain predictions or warnings. Without knowing if these actions will lead to price movements in the long run, I can't determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative. They could be a mix of some positive intentions and some speculative predictions without concrete reasons for expecting a change in the stock price."
2014-06-30,Neutral,"Alright, so I have to figure out the impact of these tweets on a given company's stock price based on their sentiments. Let me start by understanding what each tweet is saying.

Looking at the tweets, most of them mention trading at specific multiples (like 105 times or 311 times), which could be indicative of technical analysis—showing that the stock might rise. Others talk about upcoming trades and stock picks with bonuses, like subscribers seeing penny stocks gaining 4,000% or other money management services.

I'll go through each tweet one by one to assess their sentiment towards positive, negative, or neutral. For example, tweets mentioning multiple stocks to watch or insider trading alerts are definitely positive because they attract attention and can increase investor interest. Conversely, negative tweets would indicate concerns about the stock's performance, maybe implying overvaluation.

I should combine all these sentiments—positive tweets boost the overall mood, while negative ones either backfire or don't add much. However, I also notice some tweets that might have conflicting messages, like multiple positive tweets and one negative one. It's important to weigh how many each sentiment contributes without dominating the overall view.

Considering the majority of positive points align with strong buy signals, it seems like the company is underperforming relative to its valuation metrics or expectations about upcoming moves. The negative tweet that mentions money management could be a minor point but still part of the broader picture.

So, combining these thoughts, the stock might face some positives from multiple sources and occasional negatives, leading me to conclude that the overall sentiment is neutral."
2014-07-01,Negative,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon stock. First, I need to identify each tweet and see what they're saying about Amazon. 

Looking at the first tweet, it mentions a watchlist, so that might be positive because it suggests support from others. The next one talks about small-cap stocks reaching high prices, which could indicate good news for investors looking at those stocks.

Then there are several mentions of $ amzn and other keywords. Some tweets highlight positive things like earnings upgrades or new features, which usually boost stock price. Others might be questioning the company's performance or talking about upcoming events.

I should probably go through each tweet step by step, categorize them into positive, negative, or neutral factors, and then assess how they affect investor sentiment towards Amazon. After that, I'll summarize to give a clear overall sentiment.

Hmm, let me see... Some tweets are about earnings upgrades, others discuss new features, and some talk about customer trust. Positive tweets could be the ones with upgrades or better news, which generally increase stock prices. Neutral might come from questions or mentions of upcoming events that aren't too significant. Negative could include negative news or potential risks.

Putting it all together, I think there are a mix of positive factors like earnings and new features, but some are questioning company performance, leading to uncertainty. This balance might keep the overall sentiment neutral because the positive and negative aspects don't tip one way clearly."
2014-07-02,Negative,"Okay, I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price and determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me start by going through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet is seeking the next stock like $CMG, $STWD, etc., but that doesn't sound related to Amazon's performance.
2. Second tweet mentions a stock watchlist with $ROL, $NEU, $AHL, $AMZN and suggests going to URLs, which might be market updates or news, not directly relevant.
3. Third tweet talks about market reports on similar stocks but again, this isn't related to Amazon's performance.
4. Fourth is about ""fast get research"" on CCE, UAL, AMZN. This could be a call for research services, which might indicate increased sentiment towards stock analysis but not directly affecting the stock price.
5. Fifth tweet mentions PBI stocks you might want to sell with TCD, CPA, AMZN, equity prices changing. Again, unrelated to Amazon's performance.
6. Sixth tweet talks about AGCO today and moving to research, not relevant.
7. Seventh is about investment research on UNI, GDI, AMZN economy. This relates to the overall economy affecting companies like Amazon, but not directly their stock price.
8. Eighth suggests doing ""do you need stock research"" on ADM, L, Ssys, AMZN and trying a free upgrade offer hitting a 52-week high. Stock research could imply increased sentiment towards analysis but might be speculative.
9. Ninth tweet says that in 2009, 12 out of every 100 new books were sold on Amazon; in 2014, it's 40 out of 100. This seems like a comparison of sales performance over time and mentions valuation metrics but isn't directly about Amazon's stock price.
10. Tenth tweet says that stocks you might want to sell with LVS, HCA, MTD on Wall Street. Again, unrelated to Amazon's performance.
11. Eleventh tweet is about investing in CLOR, LPS, AMZN and wealth management. This could indicate increased interest in AMZN due to potential investments but not a direct financial impact.
12. Twelfth tweet asks if AMZN can rally again on Goldman Sachs and hits a 52-week high. This seems like a positive outlook, which might boost investor confidence but is speculative.
13. Thirteenth tweet suggests investing in CLOR and discusses wealth management as part of investment choices. Again, unrelated to Amazon's performance.
14. Fourteenth tweet mentions Netflix shares rising due to GMU stock being upgraded by Goldman Sachs and reaching a 52-week high. This directly ties into the potential for AMZN (Netflix's competitor) to rise in value based on positive news about GMU. If GMU improves, it might lead to higher valuations.
15. Fifteenth tweet reports closed $317.50 / $322.50 BPS with a -0.08 change from -1.175 average and 20 contracts. This is about stock price movements but doesn't directly relate to AMZN's performance or the company itself.
16. Sixteenth tweet asks for top stocks today, why, on PLD, SCG, STI, AMZN and suggests visiting URLs. No relation.
17. Seventeenth tweet mentions investing in CLOR, LPS, AMZN as part of wealth management strategies.

Now, summarizing the tweets: The last tweet connects a GMU stock upgrade to GMU improving, which could influence the valuation of Amazon's GMU derivatives (e.g., Comba Structurals or GMU stock). If GMU improves, it might drive up GMU shares and indirectly affect Amazon's AMZN stock. However, other tweets are speculative or unrelated.

The overall sentiment is a mix of speculation and potential positive outlook due to increased interest in GMU improving, which could affect AMZN's valuation."
2014-07-03,Positive,"Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. I need to analyze the provided tweets to determine their likely impact on the future stock price of a company. The task is to assess each tweet and then come up with an overall sentiment score: Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

First, I'll start by identifying the target stock from the tweets. Looking through the list, several tweets mention $ amzn and other related stocks like $ aple, $ cmg, etc. This indicates that the company in question is Amazon (AMZN). So, my main focus will be on these tweets to gauge how they affect AMZN.

Next, I need to separate each tweet into Positive and Negative factors. For every relevant tweet, I'll analyze it individually before combining all of them together. Let's go through each one:

1. ""buying or selling ? $ lmt $ aapl $ rrd $ amzn equity URL"" – This seems like a generic tweet asking about purchasing or selling shares. It doesn't specify a decision but rather asks an open question, so it might indicate uncertainty without influencing the stock price directly.

2. ""no position , but $ amzn is looking quite constructive"" – This mentions that Amazon's performance is positive and suggests they have some action or potential. It could mean that AMZN is gaining momentum, which might lead to a Positive sentiment.

3. ""rt AT_USER what to do when you can't find anything to buy URL $ aapl apple $ amzn $ atw $ cmg $ cop $ cost $ crm $ ebay …"" – This tweet from AT_USER is asking for advice on where to invest or find products. It seems like a call for help rather than a recommendation, so it might not directly influence the stock price but could potentially lead to positive reactions if others are encouraged.

4. ""commented on : 'ebay : bargain or bust ?' URL $ ebay $ amzn $ ma $ v"" – The tweet is about eBay's pricing (bargain or bust), which relates to Amazon's position in that market. If eBay's prices seem undervalued, it could indicate a good investment opportunity, suggesting a Positive sentiment.

5. ""$ amazon : vows to fight ftc over how it handles children's in-app purchases URL $ amzn"" – This tweet from AMZN mentions their stance on handling child purchases, which affects their reputation and might influence investor confidence. A strong focus on quality could be seen as positive by investors. So this adds a Positive factor.

6. ""$ amazon : vows to fight ftc over how it handles children's in-app purchases URL $ amzn"" – Repeating the same statement, reinforcing Amazon's commitment to quality without child purchases. This seems like a solid message that could boost AMZN's stock price, contributing to Positive sentiment.

7. ""expected a tech selloff for stocks that earnings don't stack up .. called $ amzn top & got abuse for it .. but buy the earning tech companies ! !"" – Amazon is expected to maintain strong earnings, which would likely be good news. This suggests resilience and stability, leading to a Positive sentiment.

8. ""rt AT_USER algorithm predicts that amazon is still hot , even if the fire phone goes up in smoke ( nasdaq : $ amzn ) | seeking alpha…"" – The tweet promotes Amazon being undervalued but highlightsSeeking Alpha as a way for investors to gainAlpha (a trading strategy). This could attract more people into their strategies, which might boost AMZN's stock price positively. So this adds a Positive factor.

9. ""whats going on with $ mmm $ morn $ jdsu $ amzn nasdaq URL"" – The mention of $ mmm and $ morn suggests a tech company (maybe Meta or something similar) is in the news related to Amazon's stock. This could indicate a strategic move or market event, which might influence AMZN's performance. However, it's not explicitly stated how much impact this has, so I'm not sure yet.

10. ""awesome stock research on $ adbe $ nke $ cat $ amzn financial URL"" – This tweet mentions several companies being researched in the financial space. While Amazon is among them, the sentiment here is more about broader market interest rather than AMZN's performance directly. So it's neutral at this point.

11. ""rt AT_USER $ amzn - amazon refuses to bend to the ftcs demands over in-app purchases -> URL stock stocks stocka …"" – This tweet from AT_USER is similar to others, advising Amazon to comply with FTCS demands in their products. If they're seen as reliable and compliant, it could boost AMZN's reputation and lead to Positive sentiment.

12. ""$ vrsn pennystock research on $ amzn $ res $ tsla nse URL"" – This is about researching stocks for pennystock (possibly a company mentioned elsewhere), focusing on Amazon and Tesla. The sentiment here might be neutral since it's diversifying their investments without a clear direction.

13. ""great stock newsletter on $ cpn $ lrcx $ lpla $ amzn liquidity URL"" – A positive news item about AMZN's liquidity, which could indicate good news for the company. This supports a Positive sentiment.

14. ""AT_USER way to go ! here is why URL you are leading your $ amzn $ aapl 30f7e takethisbet"" – A tweet encouraging others on and suggesting investments in AMZN. While not directly about stock price, it might lead to increased demand, contributing to a Positive sentiment.

Now, compiling all these factors:

- Positive tweets include: 2 (AMZN momentum), 4 (bargain or bust), 5 (good focus), 6 (strong stance), 7 (positive earnings), 8 (alpha push). This is the majority.
- Negative tweets: None identified clearly.

So overall, there are clear positive signals. The tweet from AMZN about fighting FTOC demands and their strong expectations of resilience are strong indicators that their stock price will rise. The other tweets either don't impact it directly or have neutral or slight negative elements but mostly support a Positive outlook."
2014-07-04,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's future stock price. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

First tweet: ""$ amzn [ $ $ ] jd's promise already in share price URL."" Hmm, ""jd's"" probably refers to JD Less Company. It says they promise a share price URL. That sounds like a vague investment promise, maybe just stating that Amazon is making progress or has something favorable. Not sure about the impact yet.

Second tweet: ""$ amazon has the best phone and may develop the best ecosystem $ amzn $ aapl URL."" This seems positive because it mentions Amazon's best phone and future ecosystem potential. That sounds like a solid outlook, so this could be a strong positive factor.

Third tweet: ""are you thinking of selling $ cpt $ spw $ vly $ amzn stock URL."" The mention of selling stock suggests that people are considering selling their Amazon shares. This might indicate a sell-off or concern about rising costs, which could negatively impact the stock price.

Fourth tweet: ""$ amzn - amazon under scrutiny over eu tax affairs -> URL stock stocks stockaction."" Under scrutiny and EU tax issues sound serious. Tax complications might make investors cautious, leading to potential negative sentiment.

Now, putting it all together. There's a strong positive about Amazon's best phone and future ecosystem, but there are signs of concern from tax matters and possible selling pressure. The positive tweet has one factor, while the others have multiple negative or mixed factors. This mix makes me think there might be overall uncertainty and mixed signals, which could lead to a neutral or slightly negative impact on the stock."
2014-07-05,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for a given company. The user provided seven tweets, each addressing different topics related to investing in Amazon (AMZN). 

First, I need to extract the target stock from each tweet. Since all the tweets mention AMZN, that's straightforward. So, the target stock is AMZN.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one and break them down into factors: Positive and Negative. Then evaluate the sentiment of each factor based on the provided context. Finally, combine these to decide if the overall impact is positive, neutral, or negative.

Let's start with the first tweet: ""$ aes considering investing in $ amzn $ ffiv $ trla nse URL"". The word ""investing"" indicates a positive action by someone trying to buy AMZN. That seems like a positive factor because it shows interest in AMZN. 

The second tweet is ""$ would you like great research on stocks $ mos $ nvr $ csco $ amzn financial URL."" This one seems more neutral since it's asking for research, not directly mentioning positive or negative actions.

Moving to the third tweet: ""$ what's going on with $ avp $ cnqr $ exr $ amzn liquidity URL"". Again, ""investing"" is mentioned, which is a positive factor. The word ""liquidity"" might be related to financial health but isn't explicitly stated as positive or negative.

The fourth tweet: ""$ top performing stocks today $ fl $ wtw $ gmt $ amzn overvalued URL."" This clearly states that AMZN is overvalued, which is a direct negative factor because it suggests higher stock price than market believes.

The fifth tweet: ""$ looking for more info on $ pm $ aos $ pnw $ amzn financialnews URL."" While the user is seeking information on financial news related to AMZN, there's no mention of positive or negative sentiment. This might not significantly impact the overall sentiment.

The sixth tweet: ""$ nov best research on stocks such s $ intc $ mu $ amzn nse URL."" Similar to the second tweet, it's asking for research but without specifics on whether it's positive or negative actions. So, this is neutral.

Lastly, the seventh tweet: ""$ acgl stocks you might want to sell $ fisv $ sbux $ am zn moneymanagement URL"". The word ""selling"" here suggests interest in AMZN stock, which again points towards a positive sentiment as it indicates increased activity and potential buying interest.

Now, compiling all these factors:

Positive Factors:
1. Investing in AMZN
4. Overvalued stocks
7. Selling AMZN

Negative Factor:
4. Overvalued AMZN

There are three positive factors but one negative factor. However, the negative impact is more significant because it explicitly states that AMZN is overvalued. While others might indicate interest or seeking information, the direct negation makes this a strong pull against the stock.

So overall, considering the majority of positive actions and a clear negative point, the sentiment leans towards negative."
2014-07-06,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of Amzn. Let me go through each tweet one by one and see what they're saying.

First tweet is about bullish on $VTR and others. It uses ""you"" as a reference point, which suggests excitement. That's positive. Next tweet mentions stocks like CDNS, KMB, AMZN. They're talking about market reports, so that might give some indication of future performance but not sure if it's positive or negative.

Third tweet is about holding or adding to mdlz and others. It seems a bit vague and maybe just advising on actions without much sentiment.

Fourth tweet regretting investment in AVB, D, TDG, AMZN. Negative sentiment because they're mentioning regret, which makes people feel bad about their investments.

Fifth tweet talks about selling JNPR, RES, UNM, AMZN. This is a clear sell-off, so that's negative.

Sixth tweet is about losing money on Q, WCRX, MAC, AMZN equity. Again, this directly refers to potential losses, which is pretty strong negative.

Seventh tweet is about latest info on stocks like MMM, IT, VAL, AMZN equity. It seems like they're sharing information but not sure if it's positive or negative without more context.

Eighth tweet mentions bullish on ALXN, BRCM, COP, AMZN liquidity. Liquidity can affect stock price because people might buy when prices are low to keep their investments safe, so this could be a mix of signals.

Ninth tweet talks about h stocks and DBD, CADX for personalfinance. That's more related to personal finance than stocks, so probably neutral or maybe negative if the user is concerned about something else, but it's not directly tied to Amzn.

Tenth tweet asks if they're seeking the next stock like EXPE, ISRG, AMZN money. Again, a direct call to action without any positive or negative info.

Eleventh tweet mentions BR, SCG, TRMB, AMZN financial news. Like previous ones, this is just sharing information but not sure about sentiment yet.

Twelfth tweet asks about the top stocks today and wants to know why. This is more of a factual query rather than giving opinions, so probably neutral.

Thirteenth tweet refers to investing in CFN, PX, AMZN clicks. Again, vague advice without much emotion or positive/negative cues.

Fourteenth tweet suggests buying or selling CERN, AMZN, PPL, PCN. This is action-oriented but doesn't mention any sentiment towards the stock itself.

Fifteenth tweet about losing money on DWASIX. That's a strong negative sign because they're talking about financial loss directly.

Sixteenth tweet researches MCK free on AKT, NCR, AMZN rate_limit_exceeded. Mentioning something related to the company without much detail makes it hard to assess sentiment, maybe neutral if just information.

Seventeenth tweet suggests watching couple of stocks in TXBN, CBH, NYCB, AMZN economy. Economic indicators might affect stock price, but without context, it's hard to say positive or negative.

Eighteenth tweet asks about selling LPS buying or selling MSCI, NE, AMZN worth a look. Direct call to action again, no emotion or analysis.

So putting all these together, the main negative tweets are 5,6,15,16,17. These are clear calls to sell or financial losses. The positive ones have mixed reactions and less direct information. Therefore, I think the overall sentiment is negative because several explicit mentions of selling and losing money."
2014-07-07,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for AMZN. Let me start by breaking down each tweet step by step.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking through the list:

1. The first tweet mentions oxy $ vsn amzn $ fb liquidity, so it's not a direct mention of AMZN.
2. The second tweet talks about ""winners like tecd lly amzn nasdaq,"" which doesn't directly relate to AMZN.
3. Third tweet is about regretting investments in ter $ rig $ nyx money, no obvious connection.
4. Fourth is about selling or holding stocks like fitb ivz kss amzn personalfinance. Still not AMZN related.
5. Fifth mentions bearish on these stocks nus pgr urs amzn equity. Again, not AMZN directly mentioned.
6. Sixth links to danrocks, zip cash train, etc., no direct mention of AMZN.
7. The next is about the next hot pennystock vfc dfs bah. Not related to AMZN.
8. The tweet discusses amazon quietly rolling out delivery services in specific cities. That's a key point here.
9. Another tweet on joy best pennystock research jdsu ebay amzn click, but again, not directly AMZN.
10. About JCI stock watchlist, etc.
11. Mentioning holding $ nav crl tex amzn trying this URL. Not relevant to AMZN.
12. The user is upset about stocks that we loathe, so talking about AMZN performance relative to them.
13. Shoud you sell or hold like lyb dds xec. No direct mention of AMZN.
14. Looking out on dps mco gpc amzn, but not related to AMZN.
15. Insider trading updates on str stld anf amzn nse rate_limit_exceeded.

So the key points here are the one talking about Amazon's delivery services in specific cities (point 8) and the tweet suggesting the user might be holding onto AMZN due to it performing relative to other stocks (point 12). The other tweets don't directly mention AMZN or its performance, but point 8 is a significant event for AMZN.

From point 8, Amazon is rolling out delivery services, which could impact their liquidity and stock value. Point 12 talks about the user's perspective on AMZN relative to stocks they dislike. However, since these are all separate tweets, each affects different aspects of the company but not directly impacting its stock price as a whole.

Therefore, while Amazon is making changes that might affect investor sentiment, it doesn't present an overall positive or negative outlook for the stock. So the overall sentiment remains neutral because the main factors influencing AMZN's performance are external changes and individual user opinions rather than broader market trends."
2014-07-08,Positive,"Alright, so I've got to figure out how these tweets are affecting Amazon's stock price impact on their future. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol. Looking at the tweets, most of them mention AMZN or involve terms like ""hachette dispute URL."" So, I'll go with AMZN as the target.

Next, I have to analyze each tweet one by one to see if there are positive or negative factors. Positive tweets would support Amazon's stock price, while negative ones would suggest the opposite.

Let me go through each tweet:

1. ""$ amzn amazon sends letter to try to take authors 'out of the middle' of the hachette dispute URL."" This seems like a legal issue involving a company dispute. It doesn't directly affect AMZN's financial performance or stock price, so maybe neutral.

2. ""$ amzn the fresh market stales on gfs downgrade URL."" This is about reevaluating AMZN based on gold standard issues. If they're downgrading their stock, that could decrease investor confidence, which might be negative.

3. ""great stock newsletter on $ rrc $ see $ ibkr $ amzn try this rate_limit_exceeded."" This looks like a technical post but mentions something related to AMZN and a typo in ""rate_limit_exceeded."" No immediate financial implications, so probably neutral or maybe positive if it's misleading.

4. ""$ ncr bearish or bullish on these stocks $ kro $ ggp $ amzn view now URL."" Here, NCR is suggesting a view about AMZN based on other stocks. If they're bullish, that could be positive; if bearish, negative. But without more context, it's hard to say.

5. ""rt AT_USER just weeks after being named ceo, $ wmt mcmillon asked execs to read 'the everything store', about amzn's jeff bezos URL."" The CEO is encouraging execs to check a post on the Everything Store, which mentions Jeff Bezos. Not sure how that relates directly to AMZN stock, so maybe neutral.

6. ""stocks you might want to sell $ jwn $ ter $ rig $ am zn click url."" This seems like a warning about selling stocks to avoid loss. Selling stocks typically decreases cash and can be seen as negative for the investor's portfolio, which could affect their balance sheet but not necessarily the stock price immediately.

7. ""stocks you might want to hold onto $ cf $ dish $ ipgp $ amzn wealthmanagement url."" Similar to tweet 6, this is about managing stocks without holding them, which reduces cash and possibly affects portfolio performance. Again, maybe neutral or negative for investors concerned with liquidity.

8. ""looking for research on fosl adbe teg amzn nse url."" This seems like a search for financial reports or analysis on AmZN against Facebook. If they're looking for information without impacting the stock price directly, it might be neutral if no immediate impact is expected.

9. ""are you investing in avp chtr trza am zn newsletter url."" Asking about investments and a newsletter related to AMZN. The newsletter could provide insights or updates on the stock, which could influence investor sentiment positively if they see value. So this might lean towards positive.

10. ""dont want to lose like you did with nsr snh wtw amzn worth a look url."" This is an encouraging statement suggesting not to miss out on AMZN's potential. It might boost confidence and investors, which would be positive sentiment.

11. ""at user isn't am zn already a non-profit maybe the most altruistic member of the s & p."" This seems like a comment from AT_USER about their stance on Amazon being a non-profit or part of a group with many altruists. It doesn't directly relate to AMZN's performance, so probably neutral.

Now, combining all these thoughts: some tweets are about stock-related issues (2 and 11), others are about selling stocks (6-9), and one is encouraging investment choices (10). The overall sentiment seems influenced by news related to AMZN but the actual financial impact isn't clear. However, since tweet 10 emphasizes avoiding potential losses, which can be seen as positive advice for investors concerned with money, it leans towards a positive overall sentiment."
2014-07-09,Neutral,"Okay, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet mentions a pro pullback and focuses on Amazon, Facebook, and Google. This could indicate some positive sentiment towards Apple, which might affect the stock positively because of their relationship.
2. The second tweet talks about option millionaires and mentions $ AMZN going again with $ CSIQ. Option traders are a key player in the stock market, so this seems like a good sign for Amazon's performance.
3. The third tweet is a reaction to Apple's potential setback due to China issues. This shows Apple's concern, which might make investors cautious about its stock price.
4. The fourth tweet says they're looking for the next $ AMZN SFRD and must see them. This seems like an informational tweet without strong positive or negative cues.
5. The fifth tweet mentions futures holding steady ahead of FOMC, indicating a cautious approach to investing in stocks. This could be seen as neutral because it's about maintaining positions.
6. The sixth tweet talks about vmware growth slowing and downsizing shares due to the Wells report. If there are concerns about job losses or economic changes, this might negatively impact Amazon's stock.
7. The seventh tweet is a list of companies with earnings beating expectations. Positive news can boost a company's stock price.
8. The eighth tweet focuses on NASDAQ rate limit issues for a specific stock. This could be seen as a warning if there are concerns about regulatory changes affecting the market.
9. The ninth tweet suggests watching several tech stocks, which might indicate diversification from Apple and Amazon.

Now, combining these thoughts: While some tweets (like the third and seventh) show positive information, others like the fifth, sixth, eighth, and ninth are more about caution or concerns. However, the overall sentiment seems mixed, with both favorable signs (like earnings beats and option traders) and some negative ones (like potential setback). I'm leaning towards a neutral assessment because there's conflicting positive and negative signals."
2014-07-10,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the overall sentiment for this list of stock-related questions. Let me start by looking at each entry and understanding what's being asked.

First, there are a bunch of URLs followed by questions about specific stocks or market trends. The user seems to be engaging in some sort of analysis or discussion around investing topics. I need to parse the sentiment from these individual queries.

I notice that many entries have phrases like ""how will amzn stock react..."" and ""will flo stock react..."" which indicate a focus on future trends, predictions, or upcoming events affecting certain stocks. Some are more specific about the companies involved, while others are more general about how they might perform.

Looking at the structure, it seems that each entry is presented as a separate thought bubble in a chat, where someone is trying to discuss their investments or market analysis. The questions are all open-ended and likely intended to elicit detailed discussions rather than straightforward answers.

However, when looking for sentiment towards positive, neutral, or negative, I realize that the context here is more about analyzing potential future moves rather than just stating a view. The users are discussing how stocks might react without necessarily providing factual information or opinions on any particular stock.

Since each entry is presented as an individual thought bubble, it's challenging to determine a collective overall sentiment because they don't all agree or present a single viewpoint. Instead, they're varying in their focus and the type of analysis they're doing—some are more speculative about market trends, others might be discussing other stocks.

I'm not sure if this is about the users' opinions collectively or if each question reflects different sentiments within the same user. Without more context on how these questions relate to each other or any prior discussions, it's hard to assign a single sentiment tag like positive, negative, or neutral.

But perhaps some of the entries are more towards the positive side because they're talking about potential positive moves in tech companies, which can sometimes have strong growth potential. Other entries might be leaning negative if someone is speculating on something like an impending regulatory issue affecting amzn.

However, looking back at the initial instruction, I need to conclude with a single line stating the overall sentiment using one of [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Given that each entry is speculative and not factual, it's impossible to assign a clear sentiment because they don't present any balanced viewpoints or factual analysis.

Maybe the question assumes that all these analyses are from the same user or context, but without more information, I can't determine which direction the overall sentiment leans. It's possible that some entries might be leaning positive due to their speculative nature, while others could be negative if they're discussing something like a tech company facing a competitive threat.

I'm starting to think that perhaps the conclusion is that there's no clear overall sentiment because each question offers different perspectives and not all are necessarily in favor of one direction. Without more data or context, I can't assign an exact tag."
2014-07-11,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price based on my analysis. Let me start by understanding each tweet individually.

First, the target stock is AMZN. Now, looking at the tweets:

1. ""te insider trading updates on $seic$adt amzn research url"" – Hmm, this seems like a legal matter and doesn't directly impact Amazon's performance.
2. ""top performing stocks today $aflirm ndsn amzn economy url"" – Talks about stock performance, but it's speculative and not necessarily news affecting AMZN.
3. ""stocks to watch this week $amzn dlb hpq wtw must have url"" – Again, looking at future trends, no immediate impact on current stock.
4. ""am zn gild s wallstreet url"" – This is about upcoming companies but not related to AMZN itself.
5. ""am zn - amazon's e-books antitrust clash in germany on eu radar -> url stock stocks stockaction"" – Discusses a legal situation, which might affect Amazon indirectly through market reactions, but no direct info on stock performance.
6. ""am zn out of august 350 calls AT_USER from $12 . will not re-enter august , for now only looking at weeklies."" – Talks about option trading and user actions, not directly related to AMZN's price.
7. ""rt AT_USER amazon formally requested permission from the faa to start testing drones."" – This is a legal move by Amazon, which might affect competitors but not necessarily AMZN.
8. ""am zn rallies ; msck slip -> url stock stocks stockaction"" – Rallies in AMZN but no immediate data or news about its performance affecting the market.
9. ""am zn formally requested permission from the faa to start testing drones."" – Another legal move, same as tweet 7, possibly impacting competitors.
10. ""rt AT_USER amazon formally requested permission from the faa to start testing drones."" – Same as above, more likely a duplicate or additional info on the same topic.
11. ""look out box and dropbox : here comes amazon's zocalo url via at_user amzn cloudcomputing"" – Discusses a product (Zocalo) that might not be directly related but could influence price based on marketing.
12. ""rt AT_USER market is cheering am zn not for drones but for their strategy of eating and competing with ecosystem ... hmm en …"" – Talks about user sentiment towards AMZN, which could affect investor confidence.
13. ""rt AT_USER amazon formally requested permission from the faa to start testing drones."" – Another legal move, possibly unrelated or additional info.
14. ""am zn largest call line is oct 400 calls = 10,000 sitting in open interest ..."" – Describing a technical detail about AMZN's trading volume but not impacting current stock price.
15. ""thg best pennystock research pcyc usm amzn equity url."" – Talks about pennystocks and their research, no direct info on AMZN.
16. ""rt AT_USER amazon is surging today on news that it's seeking approval to test drones."" – This directly mentions a company (Amazon) requesting permits for drone tests, which could lead to increased demand in the ecosystem but not necessarily affecting AMZN's price.
17. ""rt AT_USER am zn is hungry ! 5 takeaways from amazon’s big cloud day url < punchline: beware platforms doing we …"" – Discusses Amazon's achievements and potential risks of competitors, possibly influencing investor sentiment indirectly.
18. ""what if aws cash flow has gone negative on price war with goog/gsmt/amzn pushing sales to 3p to increase float?"" – Talks about financial metrics affecting AMZN but not directly related to the stock price.
19. ""rt AT_USER amazon formally requested permission from the faa to start testing drones."" – Another legal move, possibly unrelated or additional info.
20. ""apl $ amzn $ msft $ intc $ googl what's next for big tech?"" – Talks about upcoming tech companies, which might affect AMZN's valuation but not its stock price directly.
21. ""are you thinking of selling gmt al etn amzn newsletter rate_limit_exceeded."" – Discusses a newsletter related to AMZN and potential selling pressure based on user sentiment.
22. ""find out the latest on oke flr woof am zn i suggest url.""

Looking at all these, only tweet 6 talks about option trading actions by users, which can sometimes lead to market shifts or sentiment changes. The rest are either legal matters, technical details, or speculative market discussions. None of them directly mention any positive or negative information that would affect AMZN's stock price. Therefore, I'm leaning towards aneutral impact."
2014-07-12,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query step by step. The user provided some tweets and asked about their impact on the stock price of Amazon. They want an analysis using positive, neutral, or negative sentiment.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking through the tweets, all mention ""amzn"" as the stock ticker. So, the target is Amazon (AMZN).

Next, each tweet seems to have multiple points. The first few tweets are about formal requests for permissions from the FDA to test drones on AMZN's stock. They also mention other stocks like Wells Fargo and FARGO.

I should look for factors in each tweet that influence investor sentiment. The FDA request is a big one—it could affect safety regulations, which might impact consumer trust and thus the company's performance. But since I don't have specific data on market reactions to FDA guidelines before, it's hard to assess the impact yet.

The rest of the tweets talk about research opportunities for stocks like WXT (Wait Extra), EIX, MTB, and Amazon. These are all financials or tech-related stocks that can influence stock prices. However, without context on current events affecting these sectors or specific market conditions, it's speculative.

Combining these factors: multiple FDA requests could be a red flag for regulatory scrutiny, potentially lowering confidence in the company's fundamentals. But the positive tweets mention research opportunities and financials, which can drive up stock price. The negative sentiment from FDA is less clear because it's more about safety rather than performance metrics.

Overall, I don't have enough data to confidently say whether Amazon is up or down. There are conflicting signals—positive mentions of research but negative ones about FDA issues. So, my conclusion needs to be neutral, acknowledging the mixed signals."
2014-07-13,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze the given tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. **Stock Symbols**: The symbols mentioned are $amzn, $vmw, $mck, etc., which clearly identify Amazon. So, all these tweets are related to Amazon.
   
2. **Positive/Negative Factors**:
   - Tweet 1: Talks about stocks and mentions the economy. Neutral factors because it's more general and doesn't state a clear up or down trend.
   - Tweet 2: Also focuses on the economic environment but again, not specific enough for positive or negative sentiment.
   - Tweet 3: Discusses stock prices for mar, mnst, bmrn, which I think are other companies. Neutral factors as they don't mention Amazon.
   - Tweet 4: Talks about competitive earnings against competitors like Google and Microsoft, suggesting Amazon is doing well. Positive factor here.
   - Tweet 5: Involves the beverage industry with green mountain and keurig, but not necessarily positive or negative for Amazon.
   - Tweets 6-8 are about alternatives like keuright and others. They don't directly relate to Amazon's stock.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Most tweets are neutral because they cover other companies without specific advice on Amazon. The only positive factor is Tweet 4, where the tweet implies that Amazon is performing well due to beating competitors' earnings.

4. **Overall Sentiment**: Since most tweets don't provide insights into Amazon's performance and only mention other industries or general stock topics, it seems like there's no clear direction for Amazon's stock price. Therefore, the sentiment isn't strongly positive, negative, or neutral."
2014-07-14,Neutral,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to determine the impact on the stock price for this company based on the given tweets. 

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet because that's essential. Looking at the tweets, they all mention AMZN, which is Apple Inc., so I think the target stock is Apple.

Next, I have to analyze each tweet to identify Positive and Negative factors. Let me go through them one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions best research on stocks like $nati$kors onxx amzn click URL. That doesn't directly mention anything about the company itself, so maybe it's a link or an unrelated tweet.
2. The second tweet talks about platinum members seeing penny stock picks gaining 4,000% in four months. This seems positive because it mentions gains and expectations for the stock price, which is Apple's.
3. The third tweet suggests finding more winners like sc $cbsh$ amzn df wallstreet. Again, not directly about the company but mentioning a strategy or approach related to Apple.
4. The fourth tweet discusses Fibonacci technical levels with AmZN, AAPL, FB, and GOOG. This is all about Apple's stock prices moving based on some technical analysis, which could be positive because it relates to investor sentiment towards the stock.
5. The fifth tweet mentions MHFI and IP as relevant to stocks like $mhfi$ ip $amzn$. Not sure what MHFI or IP are, but maybe they're indicators of interest in Apple's performance. Maybe this is neutral since I don't have info on their specific impact.
6. The sixth tweet provides a stock quote for AmZN at 12:47 pm with a price increase of +7.568%, which is significant and positive. This could indicate strong investor sentiment.
7. The seventh tweet suggests that small-cap stocks breaking into a 52-week high prices might destory the industry before it's primed to launch. If the stock is expected to drop, this would likely be negative as it affects investor confidence.
8. The eighth tweet talks about small-cap stocks breaking their 52-week highs and considering viewing them now. Similar to the seventh tweet, if the stock is expected to drop, that could be negative sentiment.

Now, putting this together. The fifth tweet mentions MHFI and IP, which I don't know much about. But the sixth tweet shows a significant price increase of +7.568%, which is a positive indicator. However, the seventh tweet suggests that if small-cap stocks break their 52-week highs before being launched, it could lead to negative sentiment as investors might worry about the company's stability.

So, some tweets are positive with clear mentions of stock price movements (like tweet 6), while others are more speculative or related to technical analysis (tweets 1-4 and 8). Tweet 7 is ambiguous but seems like a warning for small-cap stocks. 

Considering all these factors, the overall sentiment could be a mix of positive and slightly negative. The strong price increase in tweet 6 is a big plus, but if there's uncertainty about future launches or market conditions, it might still lead to mixed results.

Therefore, I'll conclude that the stock has some positive signs but with room for uncertainty, making it not strictly neutral nor too negative."
2014-07-15,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company like Amazon (AMZN). I'm not very familiar with all the factors involved, but I'll go step by step.

First, looking at each tweet individually. The user provided 10 tweets about AMZN stock. I need to extract the stock symbol from each one. Hmm, in the first tweet, it's ""lisi lnsse nse url"". Wait, that doesn't seem right because ""lnsi"" might be a typo for something else, maybe ""ltn""? So I'll assume they meant $ltn instead of $lnsi. Similarly, let me check each one carefully:

1. $tpx lsi syk amzn nse url: The symbol here is $tpx.
2. $am zn lone star reopens tokyo property deal as gic talks stall-sources url: The symbol might be $am or $amzn? This seems a bit ambiguous, but let's go with $am for simplicity.
3. $stwd are you looking for winners like $amzn $tyc $opk singdiinvestor url: Again, the symbols could vary here. Maybe $stw and $tyc?
4. $great stock newsletter you must have $pbf $shld $pcl $amz financial url: The symbol is $amz.
5. $am zn - google glass creator has new role at amazon -> url: The symbol could be $amzn.
6. $dpz bcr siri amzn must have url: The symbol might be $amzn.
7. Still holding the $gwph intc sndk big bbry bks abc mu amzn shorts and started a kndi short 2day. still long vtr pnra: The symbols here are multiple, including $amz in some parts. Maybe focusing on $amzn as the main symbol.
8. $am zn why cost of spotify and other music streaming services must increase ... url: Again, $amzn is present.
9. 5 stocks you should be watching $gas $tmhc $bmr $amzn visit url: $amz again.
10. $swks it's it breakout time on $x ec $t tc $am zn nasdaq url: The symbol could be $amzn.

So, the main stock symbols involved are mostly $amzn. Now, I need to analyze each tweet in terms of positive and negative factors related to AMZN.

Let me go through each tweet one by one:

1. ""looking for more info on $tpx lsi $syn $amzn nse url"": This is about information resources company (LSI). Not directly about AMZN, so maybe not relevant here.
2. ""$am zn lone star reopens tokyo property deal as gic talks stall-sources url"": This mentions a property deal and GIC talks. Property deals can sometimes affect stock prices, but it's more of an event rather than something related to AMZN. Maybe some sentiment about the market overall?
3. ""stwd are you looking for winners like $am zn $tyc $opk singdiinvestor url"": This is a call to action, inviting investors to participate in a competition with other winners. It seems like an investment strategy or group buying.
4. ""$great stock newsletter you must have $pbf $shld $pcl $amzn financial url"": A newsletter announcing good news. Maybe positive sentiment if it's about AMZN's financials.
5. ""$am zn - google glass creator has new role at amazon -> url"": Google Glass is a term used by Amazon in their partnership with Google. This could be seen as a strategic move, which might be seen positively for stock price because Amazon gains market share.
6. ""top stocks today . find out why . $dpz $bcr $siri $am zn must have url"": Again, mentions AMZN. Not sure about sentiment here; more of an informational query.
7. ""still holding the $gwph intc sndk big bbry bks abc mu amzn shorts and started a kndi short 2day . still long vtr pnra"": This is a call to hold AMZN after selling some positions. It shows investor sentiment about keeping their position, which might be positive.
8. ""$am zn why the cost of spotify and other music streaming services must increase ... url"": Discusses a market event related to music streaming services. Maybe financials or stock performance influenced by this, but not directly AMZN's.
9. ""5 stocks you should be watching $gas $tmhc $bmr $amzn visit url"": Another call to action, suggesting investment in AMZN along with others mentioned. This seems positive for the user looking to hold AMZN.
10. ""$swks it's it breakout time on $x ec $t tc $am zn nasdaq url"": A countdown timer for NASDAQ. Not directly related to AMZN stock.

Now, I need to assess each tweet's impact. 

- Tweets 5 and 9 are about Google Glass partnership with Amazon, which could be positive because it might improve the company's market position, so this would likely be a positive sentiment.
- Tweet 10 is about a countdown timer on NASDAQ, not directly related to AMZN stock.
- Tweets 3, 4, 6, and 8 are more about other companies. Tweet 3 is an investment call; Twitter sometimes posts investments, but the impact might vary. Tweet 4 is a newsletter with good news, which could boost AMZN's sentiment. Tweet 6 asks for info on AMZN's performance, so it's not a tweet that affects stock price.
- Tweets 7 and 9 are about AMZN positions; they show an investor's decision to hold the stock, indicating positive sentiment towards holding.

However, some tweets like 1, 2, and others don't directly relate to AMZN. Tweet 2 is about property deals, which could have short-term effects on the market but not long-term. 

Given that several tweets indicate an expectation of AMZN's continued position (tweets 5,9,3,4,6,7,9), these are strong indicators of positive sentiment towards holding AMZN. However, some tweets suggest a call to action or investment, which can sometimes show hesitation but might be interpreted as risk-averse behavior.

Considering the overall impact on stock price expectations, there's a mix of positive and slightly negative signals, especially from calls to hold and investments. The most significant factors are the partnership tweet (5) and holding tweets (7,9), both indicating that AMZN is being held by investors, which can boost the stock price.

But Twitter's sentiment analysis might lean more towards positive for a few reasons: the call to action on tweet 7, which could indicate confidence in keeping the stock, and tweet 9, suggesting focus on NASDAQ's performance. However, without direct mentions of positive factors related to AMZN's earnings or market performance, it's hard to say if these are truly positive from an AMZN standpoint.

Taking all into account, the overall sentiment is mixed but leans towards positive due to investor calls and positioning, while some signals might be negative in a broader sense."
2014-07-16,Negative,"Alright, I'm looking at these tweets and trying to figure out their impact on the stock price for Amazon (AMZN). Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet mentions AMZN's employees being top among tech companies in terms of 'attractive'. That seems positive because it's talking about the company's strengths, which can boost investor confidence.
2. The second tweet talks about top-performing stocks and specific companies like HCP and NWSA. This could influence investor sentiment positively if they're ahead or negatively if not.
3. The third tweet from AMZN is speculative with ""mulls Netflix-like e-book streaming service"". It doesn't specify a positive or negative outcome, so it's neutral.
4. The fourth tweet compares Amzn to Google's shopping express for local businesses. If a product is better locally, that could be a selling point, which might be positive.
5. The fifth tweet talks about breakouts on VFC, BMY, Away, and AMZN conducting research. Breakout stocks can be attractive and lead to gains.
6. The sixth tweet suggests watching some stocks like WMS or SSO for a try. This could influence investor interest, but it's speculative without clear positives or negatives.
7. The seventh tweet about NFLX seeking a hot pennystock related to Amazon mentions the rate limit. If the rate is exceeded, it might lead to more trading activity or price drops.
8. The eighth tweet advises investors in RHI, AHL, VMI, and AMZN on rate limits. Similar to tweet 7, this could affect pricing or trading activities.
9. The ninth tweet mentions a stock research on GS, ABT, AMZN, Live Investing. It's general but might not have clear direction.
10. The tenth tweet is about a stock watchlist for WOOF and being behind others. This seems like it might cause a sell-off as people start to lose confidence.
11. The eleventh tweet talks about AMZN supporting near $346.95, which could be a positive sign if the company's fundamentals look good.
12. The twelfth tweet advises investing in RHI, AHL, VMI, and AMZN on rate limits. Again, speculative but might influence investor behavior.
13. The thirteenth tweet about Viab being top-performing stocks near $500. This is positive as it's a strong indicator of market sentiment.
14. The fourteenth tweet mentions stock market reports for companies like CWH, OI, AMZN. Rate limits could affect these reports, which in turn can influence the stock price.
15. The fifteenth tweet about Yellen being smacked up and getting laughter on SPY, QQUQ, Aapl, AMZN. This is a negative event that could lead to stock selling as investors become angry.
16. The sixteenth tweet talks about an unexpected retail turnaround in SPLS with AMZN.

Putting it all together, the tweets are mostly positive or speculative but include some sell-offs when rate limits were exceeded and specific stocks like Viab being strong. There's also a negative event related to Yellen being criticized. The overall sentiment seems mixed because of the speculative nature of many tweets and the unexpected events that can drive stock prices in various directions."
2014-07-17,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative in terms of their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions avoiding a $kmb URL and talks about climbing on earnings. That sounds like good news for Amazon because higher earnings could mean more growth and potentially better stock performance. So this seems positive.

2. The second tweet is about Amazon's stock climbing on earnings, with some fighting back from Russia due to sanctions. Also, it mentions a $EBITCLF slash. Positive aspects of earnings usually translate well into good stock moves, so I'm leaning towards positive here too.

3. Third tweet talks about stock market reports on companies like P&G and BAC. These are general reports that don't specifically relate to Amazon. They might mention some data but without context on Amazon's performance, it's hard to tell if this is a selling point or just generic news. Maybe not a big factor yet.

4. Fourth tweet asks for research on stocks like WSM and CNH. Similar to the third one, these seem out of scope since they don't directly mention Amazon. It could be related to broader market trends but probably doesn't have a direct impact on Amazon's stock price.

5. Fifth tweet is about the Amazon stock quote at 9:46 am with some news about a 0.73 drop from 355.17. A significant change like that can indicate positive or negative sentiment, but it's not clear if this is due to good earnings or bad news. It might be moderate in impact.

6. Sixth tweet mentions research on DEI and OCR by Amazon. Again, these are unrelated topics. The focus here is on stock analysis, which could influence investor decisions but doesn't directly affect Amazon's performance unless the analysis is positive.

7. Seventh tweet looks for research on OKE and SIRO on NSE. Similar to the previous ones; again, it's not related to Amazon's stock. The information might help investors, but without specific content about Amazon, there's little impact.

8. Eighth tweet seeks the next stock like MDR, ESS, JIZ for a look. This is speculative and doesn't provide any direct information about Amazon or its performance. It could be a way to gauge market sentiment, but it's not clear how significant this will be.

9. Ninth tweet asks for more info on BK,awk, SM, AMZN financials. Financial reports can sometimes indicate future performance if they're positive, but again, without context on Amazon, it's speculative and might not have a direct impact.

10. Tenth tweet explains bull calls with a live trade involving FB and TWTR. Bull calls are trading strategies where you buy calls against the upside and sell short the underlying stock. This could affect Amazon's stock price if it affects the underlying companies or other investors in those trades, but it's more about market dynamics and speculation rather than direct stock performance.

11. Eleventh tweet is asking for great research on DSO, VTR, LNK, AMZN in personalfinance. Again, personalfinance is a different topic; while it might influence financial decisions, it doesn't relate to Amazon directly or in a way that would impact stock price growth negatively or positively.

So, going through each one, the tweets are mostly either positive or neutral since they don't specifically target Amazon's performance but cover other areas. The negative aspects are minimal and mostly speculative or unrelated."
2014-07-18,Positive,"Alright, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol, which seems to be ""amazon"" throughout the tweets. That makes sense because all the mentions are of AWS and related terms like $ amzn.

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate positive (P) and negative (N) factors and assess their sentiment. Let's start:

1. **rt AT_USER amazon launches kindle unlimited service URL $ amzn**
   - No obvious words here. It's just a launch announcement. Not much to unpack except that it's a new product launch, which is positive.
   
2. **$ amzn amazon launches kindle unlimited service -> URL stock stocks stockaction**
   - This seems like an ad or promotional message suggesting buying the stock as part of a stockaction. Such promotions can boost investor interest and sentiment.
   
3. **$ amzn amazon rolls out ' netflix-for-books ' style service URL**
   - Again, it's promoting a new product. The mention of netflix is positive because it brings in potential revenue streams, especially for books. This seems like a strong positive factor.
   
4. **what kindle unlimited means for authors $ amzn URL**
   - Similar to tweet 2, this offers value to users who care about books and technology, which can improve sentiment positively.
   
5. **choosing the right options strategy for a trade URL $ amzn $ fb $ twtr**
   - This is promoting a stock that could be trading on the platform. It's more about providing an opportunity rather than just selling, so it adds to investor interest.
   
6. **$ amzn introducing kindle unlimited : unlimited reading and listening on any device — just $ 9.99 a month [ business w ... URL**
   - This is clearly promoting a subscription service that offers value at a low price point, which is a classic positive sign for stock performance.
   
7. **$ amzn amazon starts $ 9.99- a-month service for unlimited kindle e-books URL**
   - Similar to tweet 6, this is a direct promotion of the product with a clear value proposition and low cost.
   
8. **after reading theeverythingstore i feel even better about having $ amzn as my biggest position .**
   - This seems more like an anecdotal positive statement. It's expressing confidence or satisfaction, which can boost sentiment positively towards the stock.

9. **the seven horseman of the non-apocalypse : $ ua $ amzn $ intc $ epi $ twtr $ bcoin & short $ gld**
   - While this tweet is about a speculative investment strategy (seven horsemen in crypto), it's not directly promoting Amazon's services. It might encourage some risk-taking, but since it's about alternative investments, the positive impact isn't clear or direct.

10. **rt AT_USER first thing you learn at d . e . shaw is not to short a shaw alumnus $ amzn**
    - This seems like a tip-off suggesting avoiding a relationship, which can have negative effects on investor sentiment if it's seen as advice to avoid certain things.
    
11. **$ amzn : oui , oui : how amazon is pissing off the french government URL**
    - Again, this is a promotional message promoting Amazon's services. The mention of being ""pissing off"" might imply something good or positive about their products.
    
12. **AT_USER pop some $ amzn $ goog $ celg $ ma $ scty $ xoom $ cara $ mrin in there and be the man - - ull learn little one**
    - This is more of a promotional tip encouraging users to invest in Amazon, which could boost interest.
    
13. **stocks to hold onto $ gas $ tup $ trn $ amzn economy URL**
    - Promoting holding certain stocks for an economic reason. This suggests that the stock might perform well, positive sentiment.

Now, summarizing each tweet's sentiment:

- Tweets 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13 are all promoting or suggesting buying Amazon's services either directly or indirectly.
- Tweet 9 is speculative but not clearly positive.
- The negative tweet is 10.

Considering the majority of these tweets are about promoting Amazon's services, especially with incentives like subscriptions and high-value products. Promotions generally indicate confidence in the stock's potential to rise in value. While some tweets might touch on related but less direct topics (like cryptocurrency), they don't outweigh the positive ones."
2014-07-19,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of Amazon. So, first I need to identify the target stock. Looking at the tweets, all of them mention ""amzn"" or ""amazon"". I think the user mentioned they're looking at stocks related to Amazon.

Next, I should break down each tweet to find out if it has positive or negative factors. For example, in the first tweet, there's a mention of Facebook and an emoji saying ""guess who?"" It seems like no one is talking about Amazon, so maybe that's not helpful here. The second tweet talks about stocks but just mentions them without any context on Amazon.

The third tweet starts with ""$ trn $ cov $ amzn $ rax"" and says to sell. So, the seller is selling a stock. That would likely be negative because selling reduces your investment. But wait, sometimes buying or holding can affect sentiment, but here it's just selling the position.

Looking at the fourth tweet: ""get great research on stocks $ rf $ vmw $ mjn $ amzn goto URL"". Similar to the third one, there's a mention of Amazon and suggesting to go somewhere else. This could be positive because suggesting a move might influence investor behavior if it's an indicator of concern or excitement.

The fifth tweet says: ""are you bullish on these stocks $ axp $ yhoo $ amzn $ aig investing URL"". Again, mentioning Amazon in this context is a sell signal because the user is asking about bullish sentiment on Amazon stock. This would be negative as it's likely reducing investment in Amazon.

Putting this all together: The first tweet doesn't mention Amazon. The third and fourth tweets suggest selling or suggesting a move. The fifth tweet says bullish, which is also negative. So, overall, there are conflicting signals—some positive about Amazon, others negative about selling positions.

I think the sentiment might be leaning towards Neutral because while some users are selling their Amazon stock (third and fourth tweets), others are seeing increased bullishness (fifth tweet). Maybe people are getting confused or unsure, which could be neutral. Or perhaps there's a mix of emotions—some investors selling just to see if they can buy higher, while others are excited about Amazon's growth.

I'm not entirely sure, but I think the overall sentiment is probably [Neutral] because both positive and negative signals are present, leading to a balanced view."
2014-07-20,Positive,"Alright, I'm looking at this query where someone provided some tweets and wants to analyze their impact on a stock's future price. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I need to figure out which stock these tweets are talking about. The tweets mention things like $ bhi, $ chd, $ amzn, etc. So it looks like they're focusing on Amazon (AMZN). That makes sense since many of the mentions are related to Amazon.

Now, each tweet is a separate point in time. I have five tweets here, so I need to analyze each one individually and then see how they might affect the stock's sentiment.

Starting with the first tweet: ""$ bhi get more info on $ chd $ bbt $ amzn view now URL"". The words ""get more info"" and ""view now"" suggest that people are looking for information about Amazon, which could imply a positive or neutral stance. But it's not very specific, so I'm leaning towards a [Neutral] sentiment here.

The second tweet is ""$ keeping my eye on $ flir $ dgx $ d $ amzn stockmarket URL"". The words ""flir"" and ""d"" aren't directly related to Amazon, but ""stockmarket"" might imply that people are monitoring the stock. If it's about other sectors or companies, though, it could be a bit vague. However, since they're focusing on AMZN, I think this is also [Neutral] because the context isn't specific enough.

Third tweet: ""$ atvi stocks you might want to buy $ rpai $ jll $ amzn overvalued URL"". This one clearly mentions Amazon and states whether it's overvalued. The mention of ""overvalued"" directly relates to AMZN's value, which is a strong indicator of positive sentiment. I'll note that as [Positive].

Fourth tweet: ""$ keeping my eye on $ unh $ amcx $ vmi $ amzn give it a try URL"". This tweet suggests people are interested in AMCX and VMI before giving them a try to see how they perform. Since they're looking for investment opportunities, this is a positive sign because it could drive the stock up. So another [Positive] here.

Fifth tweet: ""$ is it breakout time on $ pbct $ unp $ nati $ amzn view now URL"". The terms ""breakout time"" and ""unpaid"" are familiar in stock analysis. People often look for such signals before making decisions, which can be a positive sign of potential gains. This one leans towards [Positive].

Now, combining all five tweets: the first is neutral, the second is neutral, the third is positive, the fourth is positive, and the fifth is positive. The main indicators are that AMZN is being discussed with both positive and neutral contexts. However, multiple tweets are pointing to AMZN being overvalued and favorable for investors, which reinforces a strong positive trend.

So, putting it all together, the sentiment is clearly leaning towards [Positive] because there's a noticeable push for Amazon stock and related terms that suggest interest and potential gains."
2014-07-21,Neutral,"Okay, let me go through this analysis step by step. First, I need to determine the stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at tweet 3 and 4, both mention $ amzn, so I think that's the target stock. 

Next, for each tweet, I'll separate them into Positive and Negative factors. For example, in tweet 10, there are several mentions of big earnings next week and some tech stocks. The user wants the NSE URL, which doesn't add much information about the stock itself.

Each tweet contributes to investor sentiment. Tweets that talk about increased earnings potential or upcoming earnings reports can boost investor confidence. On the flip side, if a tweet suggests lower expectations or negative news related to the stock, it can affect overall sentiment negatively.

Now, summarizing the tweets: many of them discuss future earnings, especially on specific dates like July 24 for $ amzn. The user mentions feeling like they'll have to wait, which might give some insight into their motivation but doesn't necessarily indicate a strong positive or negative trend. Some tweets are more about upcoming events and others are about the stock itself.

The overall sentiment seems mixed. There are several positive mentions of upcoming earnings reports and potential stock performance. However, there are also negative elements like unemployment mentioned in tweet 11, which could imply some concern about the market's state during that time. But these seem to be minor compared to the positive ones.

Considering all the factors—positive earnings updates, upcoming earnings reports, and maybe a touch of uncertainty from unemployment—it feels balanced. There are enough supportive signals (earnings) to offset any negative thoughts about other topics mentioned in some tweets."
2014-07-22,Positive,"Alright, so I've got this query where someone provided me with a list of tweets related to a stock called $ clr (which is actually clr, I think) and I need to determine if each tweet affects its stock price. The user wants the final answer as one of three categories: Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

First, let me look at the tweets individually to understand what they're saying. Each tweet seems to be either providing information about $ clr or discussing other companies related to it. My task is to figure out how these tweets might influence the stock price of $clr.

Starting with the first tweet: ""$ bre considering investing in $ clr $ amat $ amzn wealthmanagement URL."" It mentions wealth management but doesn't specify if it's positive, negative, or neutral about clr. I'm not sure what ""bre"" stands for here—it could be a typo or misspelling of ""buying.""

Second tweet: ""amazon : d . m . pulley named grand prize winner of the 2014 amazon breakthrough novel award ; d . m . pulley , aut ... URL $ amzn."" This looks like it's talking about Amazon winning a major award, which is positive news. However, without context on how this affects clr, I can't be certain.

Third tweet: ""what amazon's kindle unlimited means for apple , inc . $ amzn URL."" This seems to suggest that the kindle unlimited service from Amazon might benefit Apple Inc., but again, it's speculative and unclear how this impacts clr directly.

Fourth tweet: ""$ nice candle forming on $ amzn ( long )"" indicates that the user is buying shares of Amazon. This could be positive because buying more shares usually makes you feel better about it, but it's just one action without context.

Fifth tweet: ""if $ nflx is the new $ amzn it will have a much bigger bounce than this . URL."" FNA stands for False Negative Letter from Google, so if NFLX (which I think is Netflix) changes to be the same as Amazon, it might cause a big move. That's positive because a change in name could lead to increased investor confidence.

Sixth tweet: ""$ stocks to hold onto $ vno $ btu $ m $ amzn research rate_limit_exceeded"" seems like it's advising on holding onto three other stocks, which doesn't directly relate to clr.

Seventh tweet: ""$ amzn how a regular employee helped put amazon on the path to billions of dollars [ business insider ] - last year ... URL."" Here, there's mention of an employee helping Amazon reach a large sum, which sounds positive. It suggests that a positive change in their operations is happening, possibly benefiting others including clr.

Eighth tweet: ""$ amzn - netflix copycats could reveal consumers are broke -> URL stock stocks stockaction"" talks about Netflix taking another company to the forefront of copier activities. If consumers are ""broke,"" it's a negative signal that the economy is down, which might cause stocks like Amazon to perform poorly.

Ninth tweet: ""$ ipgp $ dri $ mygn $ amzn investing URL"" mentions several companies and an investment newsletter. It doesn't directly touch on clr, so I can't assess its impact on clr from this tweet.

Tenth tweet: "" insider trading updates on $ amzn $ cfx $ wfc $ rax equity URL."" Inside trading signals could indicate insider information, which is usually bad news because it affects investor sentiment negatively.

Eleventh tweet: ""it could be breaktout time on $ nav $ cim $ thrx $ amzn view now URL"" suggests that something significant is happening with Navisor or_thrux. Again, this is speculative and not directly related to clr.

So, compiling all these thoughts:

- The first tweet mentions wealth management but without context.
- Amazon winning a major award (positive news) might boost sales.
- Kindle unlimited could be positive for tech companies like Apple.
- Purchasing shares of Amazon could be seen as buying more stock, which is generally positive.
- NFLX changing to Amazon would trigger a rally, which is positive.
- An employee helping Amazon reach a large sum sounds good but not directly related.
- Negative consumer sentiment from netflix copycats might hurt Amazon.
- No direct impact on clr from this tweet.
- Inside trading could be bad news for buyers.
- A breakout time for Navisor or thrux might not relate.

Overall, the positive tweets seem to suggest that $clr is in good shape. The other tweets are either speculative, negative, or have no immediate effect. So, I'll lean towards a positive overall sentiment because several factors look favorable."
2014-07-23,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a given company. The user provided specific steps and a set of tweets, so let me break this down.

First, I'll identify the target stock by extracting its symbol. Looking at the tweets, all mention ""amzn,"" which is the ticker symbol for Amazon in the market. So, the stock in question is Amazon.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one to separate factors and assess sentiment.

1. The first tweet mentions the S&P 500 reminds us of Orwell's 1984 propaganda. That seems like a positive factor because it suggests potential good news or context.
2. The second tweet says ""now sitting on an average price of $323."" This is negative sentiment towards Amazon, indicating a drop in stock price.
3. The third tweet talks about NFLX and other tech stocks. It's not directly related to Amazon, so I'll skip this for now.
4. Another copy of the first positive tweet again mentioning Orwell-like context.
5. Same as tweet 2; negative sentiment about the stock price.
6. A stock tracker link with an update on Amazon. Not a direct tweet, but could indicate market news related to Amazon.
7. A question about whether the $1B fire phone is a loss leader when Amazon makes no money. This seems like a technicality or industry observation, not directly impacting the stock price of Amazon.
8. A research request for GCI, XRX, Amazon, and APEL equity. No direct information on Amazon's performance.
9. A tweet about $NVDA stocks to watch this week due to rate limits exceeded. Again, unrelated news.
10. Another stock watch tweet for NVIDIA, unrelated to Amazon.
11. Back to the positive context about Orwell-like content.
12. Same as tweet 11; redundant information.
13. A tweet suggesting fire products won't light up earnings if they don't make money. This is a negative factor because it might indicate financial performance issues or risks.
14. Another tech tweet from Flipkart, mentioning $1B for $5B valuation. Not related to Amazon.

Now, summarizing the factors: most tweets are positive in context but some like tweet 2 and 5 show significant negative sentiment regarding Amazon's stock price. There are also several unrelated tweets that don't directly impact Amazon's performance.

Given these observations, despite many tweets pointing towards positive factors about Orwell-like contexts or general tech trends, the direct negative sentiment on Amazon is strong enough to outweigh the context. Additionally, there's a tweet questioning Amazon's financial health which adds uncertainty and negative sentiment.

Overall, considering the mix of context and direct negative market news, it seems like the overall sentiment is Negative."
2014-07-24,Positive,"Alright, I'm going to try to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet one by one and see what they're saying.

First, the user wants me to analyze their likely effect on Amazon's future stock price, categorizing it as Positive, Neutral, or Negative. They provided a list of 43 tweets with specific details. 

Starting with tweet 1, it mentions ""s & p 1984 reminds us of orwell's 1984"" and lists some stocks. The user didn't specify any actions here, so maybe no immediate impact. 

Then, there are multiple tweets that link back to stock symbols like spy, amzn, etc., mentioning earnings and market cap changes. These seem like positive signs because it's showing Amazon's performance relative to others. For example, tweet 13 talks about higher market cap for amzn compared to fb.

There are a lot of repeats, like tweets 4,5,8,9,11,22-26, which all point back to amzn. They're talking about trends, earnings reports, and sometimes stock interactions. These are consistent and positive, so that's a strong indicator of support for the stock.

Looking at tweet 30, it says amzn is down 10% this year but mentions Amazon posting a massive sales bump. While some might think that means amzn will go up, there could be volatility too. However, other tweets point to amzn not losing money fast, so the overall sentiment seems positive.

The user also mentions market cap changes and trends for amzn across several tweets (13-26), which indicate growth and potential strength in the company. There are some negative comments like ""catalyst for a down day tomorrow?"" which could indicate concerns about amzn's performance, but combined with other positive statements, it might not sway the overall sentiment too much.

Some tweets talk about investing, especially for long-term goals (31). This shows ambition and potential appreciation, contributing to positive sentiment. However, without specific price movements or stock prices changing significantly, the impact on Amazon's stock isn't clear-cut.

I notice that multiple tweets mention ""volatility"" and ""extreme changes,"" which could imply uncertainty but might also mean the company is taking risks, which can sometimes be good for investors. But other factors like earnings reports affect sentiment more directly.

Considering all these points—consistent positive statements about trends, market positions, and potential investments—it seems that the overall sentiment towards amzn is likely Positive. The information provided supports growth, stability, or expected future performance without clear conflicting signs."
2014-07-25,Positive,"Alright, I need to determine the likely impact on Amazon's stock price based on the provided tweets. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. **Tweet 1**: The analyst comment about a deal with HBO promising all-new content URL. This sounds positive because it suggests potential growth and excitement in the company.
2. **Tweet 2**: The user is unhappy with losing money on $ RHI, $ WHR, etc., but mentions $ AMZN check out URL. There's no explicit negative sentiment here.
3. **Tweet 3**: Referring to $ QQQ, pointing out that the NASDAQ is being weighed down by $ AMZN and bounces above the 10-day line. This could indicate that AMZN's stock has negatively affected overall market valuations, which might affect investor sentiment.
4. **Tweet 4**: Similarly, referring to $ AMZN again, stating that investors are getting tired of it and asking if we should bet against Bezos. This suggests dissatisfaction with the stock performance.
5. **Tweet 5**: Mentioning $ CERN keeping an eye on $ CAT $ LLQ $ AMZN liquidity URL. This could mean they're watching the stock's trading interest, possibly monitoring it for changes that might affect price.
6. **Tweet 6**: Confirms the sensor data and mentions $ AMZN fire phone. No negative info here; just confirming details.
7. **Tweet 8**: The analyst lowers their target share-price estimates for Amazon. This is a direct downward signal from the stock owner.
8. **Tweet 9**: Referring to $ AMZN, pointing out that if it slips below $300, it qualifies for free-saver shipping. This might influence consumer spending, which could affect demand and stock price.
9. **Tweet 10**: Mentioning $ JEB ounces losing $3 billion after $ AMZN's losses. This is a clear financial loss event, signaling potential negative sentiment towards Amazon.
10. **Tweet 11**: Referring to $ PEP, mentioning trading on the $ AQO price target. No negative info here; just a reference point.
11. **Tweet 12**: Asking about holding $ AMZN after two years and whether profit was made. The user is uncertain about this trade, which might affect their decision-making.
12. **Tweet 13**: Referring to $ MKD as an interesting stock. No negative info here either; just a mention of potential.
13. **Tweet 14**: The author mentions that some prices are out of line and too much, possibly indicating overvaluation or dissatisfaction with the stock's price movement.
14. **Tweet 15**: Mentioning $ SPY (a ETF) which sells AMZN for good. This could mean a potential gain but might also signal market interest in Amazon despite current performance.
15. **Tweet 16**: Reviewing $ AMZN's hypercapitalist roots and the company's business model, suggesting growth potential but with some challenges.
16. **Tweet 17**: Referring to $ AMZN rejecting technical aspects of innovation being dangerous. This could imply a cautious approach due to concerns about the impact on profits or market acceptance.
17. **Tweet 18**: Referring to $ AMZN, discussing the danger of innovation being risky. Similar to tweet 17, indicating potential caution in investment decisions.
18. **Tweet 19**: Mentioning Jeff Bezos testing patience after $ AMZN reports big losses. This could lead to selling pressure or negative sentiment about holding onto Amazon shares.
19. **Tweet 20**: Jeff Bezos is being tested for patience by investors, indicating that they might feel the need to sell if he continues losing money. This could impact investor sentiment towards Amazon.
20. **Tweet 21**: Referring to $ AMZN, talking about short-term profits and the sustainability of profitability. The author suggests longer-term focus rather than short-term gains.
21. **Tweet 22**: Not providing any information here; just a reference or no mention.
22. **Tweet 23**: Referring to $ MKD's chart. No negative info here.
23. **Tweet 24**: Mentioning buying or selling based on overvaluation. This could indicate that the user is considering trading, but it's not explicitly negative towards Amazon.
25. **Tweets 26-31**: Referring to $ AMZN and its potential as a growth stock with good future prospects.

Overall, the tweets show a mix of positive comments about innovation, hypercapitalism, and selling interest. However, several tweets indicate concerns about financial performance (tweets 10, 19), negative sentiment (tweets 4,20, etc.), and mixed signals that might impact investor views on Amazon's future. But there are also positive comments about potential growth in areas like sensors, tech products, and selling interest.

Given all this, the overall sentiment seems a bit uncertain but leaning towards some level of uncertainty or cautiousness due to financial performance, but with positive signs pointing towards future growth."
2014-07-26,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet talks about bonds and mentions a 30-year U.S. risk-free bond yield of 3.24% for senior Amex shares at 2.90%. This seems like positive news because it's related to Amex stocks, which are part of Amazon's portfolio. I'll mark this as Positive.

2. The second tweet mentions the Q2 sales growth with a 25% increase but also notes another string of losses. It states that ""we don't care short term losses."" This is interesting because it presents ambiguity about future performance and investor sentiment, suggesting mixed emotions. So, I'll consider this as Neutral.

3. The third tweet mentions $ AMZN had a bad week, which might imply negative trends or concerns among investors. However, without more context, it's hard to assess the overall impact yet. I'll treat it as Neutral.

4. The fourth tweet refers to US news about negative sentiment on the S&P 500 at the end of July. This directly mentions a specific market index and discusses sentiment for the past month. Negative sentiment in this context can influence stock prices, so this is likely Negative.

5. The fifth tweet states that $ AMZN ended down 18% since Jeff bezos made his drone announcement last December. A significant drop in price could indicate negative news affecting Amazon's performance. I'll mark this as Negative.

6. The sixth tweet mentions that AT_USER Amazon dropped 18% since Jeff Bezos' drone announcement and refers to $ AMZN. This seems similar to the previous tweet but with a different user reference. It again shows a downward price movement, so Negative sentiment here is likely present.

7. The seventh tweet says $ AMZN has a ""war"" and references Cloud Dropbox. This is highly speculative and not directly related to Amex stock performance. Without concrete information, it's hard to determine the impact on Amazon's stock. I'll treat this as Neutral.

Summarizing the analysis: The tweets show mixed emotions regarding Amazon's stock, with some positive mentions of bonds, a mixed report about Q2 performance, negative news about price drops and specific product announcements. These factors collectively suggest uncertainty in Amex stocks, which could lead to aneutral or slightly negative sentiment overall."
2014-07-27,Negative,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First tweet: ""have investors have enough of jeff bezos walmarting business ?"" The user is talking about Jeff Bezos and his actions regarding Walmart. It seems like they're questioning whether he's doing something wrong or overreacting, which might concern investors because Jeff is a big part of the company. Maybe this causes some skepticism among people who are already invested in Amazon. So, this could be a negative factor.

Second tweet: ""new wal-mart u . s . ceo faces a long list of pressing problems URL $ wmt , $ amzn , $ fdo , $ dg."" Here, the user is talking about a new CEO for Wal-Mart and listing issues like supply chain problems. If there are serious problems with the company, it might be bad news for Amazon because Wal mart is Amazon's competitor. This could lead to a negative sentiment.

Third tweet: ""rt AT_USER investors are fed up with amazon , says analyst : URL • $ amzn."" The user mentions that analysts say Amazon's performance is on its way down and asks the user if they're fed up. If analysts are predicting a decline, it means there's concern about future earnings, which would affect stock price positively because investors might hold onto shares until things improve.

Putting this together: The first tweet has some negative questions, second mentions competitors facing issues, and third suggests a potential decline. Overall, these points could lead to investor sentiment being negative because of concerns about Jeff Bezos' actions, Wal-mart's problems, competitor issues, and analysts' predictions of lower earnings."
2014-07-28,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet mentions a launch of a 3D impression boutique. That seems like a positive announcement as it can boost demand and revenue.
2. Second tweet is about the nice day action, which is a bit vague but might indicate excitement or interest in the stock.
3. Third tweet details prices for Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Apple. These are all big tech companies with significant market presence, so this could be considered positive by many.
4. The fourth tweet says AMZN disappointed in Q2 earnings, getting closer to them. That's a negative outlook because it affects investor sentiment.
5. Fifth tweet talks about Amazon's one-month chart being funny and comparing Bezoz (a typo for Bezoit) to piloting the Hindenburg with lots of noise. This seems like a positive narrative because it's making someone happy and optimistic.
6. Sixth tweet discusses 3D printing companies slipping on an Amazon store, which is a minor update but might add value or interest in the stock.
7. Seventh tweet claims capex was at all time highs for several years and driving vendor R&D in hardware. This is a strong positive because it shows financial health and potential growth prospects.
8. Eighth tweet suggests Amazon can profit from $100 billion, which is a bold statement about potential gains but could lead to market reaction.
9. Ninth tweet updates options views URL, possibly indicating an update or change in user viewable information about the stock.
10. Tenth tweet mentions AMZN being scammed by users who are frauds or scams and their financial standings elsewhere. This is a strong negative because it shows real-world threats affecting the company's trust.
11. Eleventh tweet talks about ex-divisor date for Apple, which is a technical detail but doesn't directly impact stock sentiment.

Now, compiling these factors:

- The first tweet has multiple positive aspects ( bq museum, 3D, etc.).
- The fourth tweet gives a negative outlook on earnings.
- Fifth tweet is optimistic due to the chart.
- Seventh tweet's strong financial statement could positively affect.
- Tenth tweet adds more negatives with scams and fraud.
- Other tweets provide additional info or context.

Considering all these factors, the overall sentiment seems mixed. While there are positive updates like launches, capex statements, and user feedback on 3D printing, the negative points like earnings and fraud are significant enough to pull the stock down. The overall effect is a mix of both favorable and unfavorable information."
2014-07-29,Neutral,"Okay, let's see what I need to do here. So, the user has given me some tweets and wants me to analyze their impact on the stock price of a company. The output should be either Positive, Neutral, or Negative. Hmm, where do I start?

First, looking at each tweet one by one. The target stock symbol is missing from the tweets, but that's okay because it probably won't affect my analysis much. 

The first tweet says, ""is $ amzn a buy ? suntrust robinson humphrey thinks so : URL."" That seems like a direct question about whether Amazon (AMZN) is worth buying. I think this is a positive indicator because people are expressing their opinions on the stock. It shows uncertainty or potential, which might lead to more buying.

The second tweet mentions the AMZN market consolidating and references a Wall Street transcript interview with Christopher Rolland. Market consolidation usually means there's less activity in the sector, so it could mean investors are cautious about the company. That could be both positive (if they're seeing opportunities) or neutral/neutral because it might indicate diversification.

The third tweet says, ""AT_USER $ amzn heading down into the close."" This seems like a direct statement from someone – possibly an investor – that the stock is going to go down. I don't know who the user is, but if they're expressing a trend in their words, it could be negative because it suggests a downward movement based on personal opinion.

Now, combining these thoughts: The first tweet is positive with uncertainty. The second could have mixed feelings depending on the context of market consolidation. The third seems to suggest a downward trend, which would lean towards negative. However, since all tweets are separate and don't specify how they're connected, I might need to average or consider them together.

Wait, but the user said to analyze each tweet separately first. So maybe each tweet is considered individually? Or is there another approach? Maybe I should look for overall sentiment across all relevant tweets by considering their impact on investor confidence.

In this case, some are positive about the company, others are ambiguous because of market trends and personal opinions. But if a significant number are negative due to people thinking AMZN will drop, maybe it's leaning towards negative. Alternatively, if there's a mix, but the majority are positive with a few negatives, it could still be positive overall.

I'm a bit confused about whether I should consider each tweet separately or aggregate their effects. The user mentioned ""separate factors"" and ""overall sentiment,"" so perhaps each is considered individually, then summed up for an overall conclusion.

So, first tweet: Positive (question with uncertainty). Second tweet: Maybe neutral if the market consolidation isn't too extreme and it's about future trends. Third tweet: Negative because of personal opinion on stock movement.

But wait, AMZN often has positive sentiment from investors due to earnings reports or other factors. If the user is pointing out a potential drop, that could counterbalance the positives. However, without more context, it's hard to say exactly what each tweet signifies.

I think I need to decide that overall, the tweets are mostly positive with some negatives and an ambiguous one, so maybe leaning towards Positive because the company has been doing well in the past, but not sure about the market consolidation effect. Maybe a balance of Neutral."
2014-07-30,Neutral,"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to analyze a set of tweets related to Amazon stock ($ AMZN) and determine their impact on the future stock price. The options are [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative].

First, I need to understand what each tweet is saying about Amazon. Each tweet seems to be addressing various topics related to Amazon's financial news, product launches, or other company-related events.

1. The first tweet mentions an AMZN stock quote and provides a small positive percentage change. This is usually considered a minor indicator of sentiment.
2. The second tweet says ""losing my AMZN religion URL."" This seems to be a playful or humorous remark about losing interest in Amazon's product, which could be seen as negative because it affects investor confidence.
3. The third tweet mentions selling a put option for Amazon stock but providing the strike price and expiration date. It's more of an action than a sentiment statement, so maybe not very informative.
4. The fourth tweet is from StockTracker and suggests not to buy AMZN based on recent headlines. Again, this seems like a negative opinion because it warns against buying.
5. The fifth tweet talks about a review of an Amazon Fire phone but mentions the number of e-books being cheaper. It's likely providing positive information about Amazon's products, which could be seen as reinforcing the positive sentiment from the fourth tweet.
6. The sixth tweet provides a stock quote regarding their ability to convince people that e-books are cheaper. This is another way of encouraging more spending on e-books and could align with other positive statements.
7. The seventh tweet mentions that Amazon's Inc. has read Apple's Inc., their PLAYOUT, which is about their product development. This shows support for Amazon but might not directly impact the stock price much if it's a minor statement.
8. The eighth tweet talks about two ways to view AMZN and mentions an open question from a user a year ago. It doesn't provide sentiment but points out an ongoing topic, so maybe neutral.
9. The ninth tweet suggests investing $2 billion more in India for e-commerce competition as the race heats up. This is a strategic move by Amazon, which could boost their stock price and has positive implications.
10. The tenth tweet warns about going aggressive on the 325/30 threshold and being cautious with short selling. It's a technical cautionary note that could affect investor confidence.

Now, combining all these thoughts:

- There are several mentions of strategic investments (tweets 9), which might give Amazon an edge.
- Several negative tweets like 2 and 4 suggest some investors are avoiding AMZN due to issues or concerns about e-books.
- The positive tweets 5, 6, and 7 support the stock positively but may not be dominant factors.

Overall, while there's some indication of strategic growth (10) and minor supportive statements (9), the negative sentiments outweigh some of the positives. However, the overall trend seems to lean towards a positive impact due to Amazon's strategic moves and minor supporting information."
2014-07-31,Negative,"Alright, I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets regarding their impact on Amazon's stock price and determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me break this down step by step.

First, each tweet is about a different company or factor related to AMZN. But since the user asked for the overall impact of AMZN's tweets, I'll focus more on those that mention AMZN.

Looking at the tweets:

1. The first tweet says $amzn is an outsider as CEO after data breach. This seems negative because it indicates a major event affecting their role, which could hurt Amazon's image or decision-making process.

2. Second tweet talks about competing with Google and Facebook for startups' attention. While not directly negative, it suggests that AMZN might be facing competition, which is neutral to the stock performance.

3. Third tweet mentions ebay's subscription service exceeding expectations in Latin America. This could indicate positive news, but since it's a separate company, it's more of a side note on another aspect rather than directly impacting AMZN.

4. Fourth tweet states that investors weren't happy with Amazon's earnings and alibaba's IPO is near. This is a direct negative indicator because poor earnings can damage the stock price.

5. Fifth tweet mentions an busy week for Amazon's IPO since Facebook, which is a negative sign as it could affect investor sentiment negatively.

6. Sixth tweet is about chartguy's stock performance compared to others. Doesn't directly impact AMZN, so maybe neutral? Or maybe just not relevant unless there are specific trends related to AMZN's stock.

Now, summarizing the positive and negative factors:

Positive: No major positive tweets mentioned for AMZN.
Negative: Multiple tweets suggest issues with the company or its competitors affecting their performance, which is a negative factor.

Considering all these points, I think the overall sentiment is Negative because several tweets indicate potential problems that could hurt Amazon's stock."
2014-08-01,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on Amazon's stock price.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Scanning through them, it seems like all tweets are about Amazon. Let me check:

1. ""profit - $ amzn august 1 295 puts expiring worthless , previously shorted @ $ 0.51 ( profit of $ 0.51 )""
   - Target Stock: AMZN

2. "" $ amzn : target names outsider as ceo after data breach URL URL""
   - Target Stock: AMZN

3. "" $ wwav free research on $ cnca $ avb $ amzn overvalued URL""
   - Target Stock: AMZN

4. "" $ so top performing stocks today $ wmb $ kors $ amzn stock URL""
   - Target Stock: AMZN

5. "" $ am zn - current report filing (8 - k ) URL""
   - Target Stock: AMZN

6. "" todays movers to research $ xlnx $ ndaq $ ua $ amzn singedinvestor URL""
   - Target Stock: AMZN

7. "" rt AT_USER ex-mtv networks ceo judy mcgrath joining amazon board URL $ am zn""
   - Target Stock: AMZN

Okay, so all tweets are about Amazon (AMZN). Now I'll analyze each tweet for positive or negative factors.

1. The first tweet mentions a profit of 0.51 after expiring puts and previously shorting @ $0.51. It says the profit is 0.51. This seems like positive because it's showing an increase in value, which could be seen as bullish on Amazon.
   
2. The second tweet talks about Amazon targeting a outsider ceo after a data breach. While the specifics aren't clear (url issues), targeting an outsider might lead to media attention or stock price movement, but without details, I can't assess it much. It's uncertain.

3. Third tweet mentions free research on CNCA, AVB, AMZN, and overvalued URLs. This is positive as Amazon is being studied, which could drive investor confidence. But the mention of CNCA and AVB isn't immediately relatable to AMZN.

4. Fourth tweet says top stocks are performing well, with AMZN mentioned. This is a positive sign for Amazon, but without specifics on AMZN's performance, it's hard to tell if this is a good outlook or just speculation.

5. Fifth tweet refers to an AMZN filing as the 8th quarter. Filing reports usually provide updates and could impact stock prices by signaling future earnings, which might be positive. However, without knowing what was filed, it's uncertain.

6. Sixth tweet mentions diversifying to research on Xlnx, NDAQ, UA, and AMZN. Diversification can reduce risk but doesn't necessarily indicate a positive trend in AMZN stock unless the research suggests growth.

7. Seventh tweet refers to AT_USER, an ex-mtv ceo, joining Amazon's board. Board changes are often seen as good for management quality but might not always lead to stock movements unless there's a strategic alignment with the company.

Now, summarizing:

Positive factors include AMZN being studied (third and fourth tweets), filing reports (fifth), and managing a diversified portfolio (sixth). However, without concrete information on any of these points, it's hard to assess each tweet definitively. The uncertainty from the second tweet makes the overall sentiment tricky.

I think overall, there might be a mix of positive and neutral sentiments due to uncertain information in the second tweet. But considering the other tweets are supportive, I'd lean towards a [Neutral] stance because some info is uncertain and others are mixed."
2014-08-02,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets regarding the impact on the stock price of AmZN. Hmm, first I need to extract the target stock from each tweet. Scanning through the tweets, I see that all the stocks mentioned are related to Amzn. So that part is clear.

Now, for each tweet, I should look into whether there's a positive or negative factor. Let me go through them one by one.

The first tweet says, ""$ dnb buying or selling ? $ bsx $ ibm $ amzn stock URL."" It seems like someone is considering buying or selling stocks, but it doesn't specify the direction—whether they're going up or down. So this is a bit vague and could influence investor sentiment either way.

The second tweet: ""$ psa todays stocks you should watch $ fisv $ gnw $ amzn view now URL."" Again, similar to the first one, it's asking about stocks but not clearly indicating whether they're buying or selling. It might be a call for action on some stock.

Third tweet: ""$ stock market reports on stocks like $ adbe $ tsco $ ges $ am zn money URL."" This tweet mentions that AMZN is reporting stuff and suggests viewers watch the report. It doesn't specify whether AMZN is up or down, so it's somewhat neutral about the impact.

Fourth tweet: ""$ dell top performing stocks today $ ctxs $ bby $ amzn nasdaq URL."" Again, not directly indicating direction—just mentions that DELL is doing well and talking about AMZN.

Fifth tweet: ""rt AT_USER the main thing amazon is doing right ? stealing market share , writes michael brush URL $ amzn URL."" This one clearly states that Michael brushes is upset about Amazon stealing market share. That sounds negative because it's a direct mention of a negative event, which would likely reduce investor confidence.

Sixth tweet: ""$ alxn are you considering selling $ splk $ sd $ am zn financialnews URL."" It suggests someone might consider selling AMZN stock, but doesn't specify whether they're selling up or down. Could be either, so it's mixed.

Seventh tweet: ""$ whats going on with $ vrtx $ tel $ luk $ am zn worth a look URL."" Again, just talking about something happening with other stocks without mentioning AMZN directly. It could indicate that others are watching but doesn't provide direction for AMZN.

Eighth tweet: ""$ great stock newsletter on $ hcp $ te $ gs $ amzn financialnews URL."" Similar to the first few, it's asking about a newsletter but not specifying direction. Maybe just looking at sentiment from this tweet alone isn't enough.

Ninth tweet: ""here are some stocks to watch $ jpm $ utx $ cci $ am zn i suggest URL."" Again, not directly indicating direction—just suggesting someone might consider AMZN stock, which is a call for action without a clear positive or negative outlook.

Putting this all together, the main issue here seems to be Michael brushes upset with Amazon stealing market share. That's definitely negative news for AMZN. The other tweets don't provide enough information about AMZN itself—either by asking about stocks they might hold or suggesting that others watch them—but each mentions different companies related to Amazon.

So considering all these, the strong negative sentiment from the fifth tweet likely dominates here. It tells investors directly about a potential negative event affecting their stock, which is a clear signal for them to adjust their holdings and possibly reduce investments in AMZN."
2014-08-03,Positive,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether these tweets will have a positive, neutral, or negative impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol 'amzn'. The tweet mentions that there might be a breakaway time on certain keywords related to Amazon. Words like "" Coh"", ""Byi"", and ""PF"" sound familiar, which I think are slang for specific companies or terms in the tech space.

I remember hearing about ""Coh"" and ""Byi"" before—they were platforms where people discuss company news and stock updates. The mention of a ""breakaway time"" probably means something significant happening quickly on these platforms related to Amazon. Investors often look for potential announcements that could lead to major changes in the market, especially on Twitter-like platforms.

The user is suggesting that if there's a breakaway event, it might be worth looking into. This seems like a proactive take, which usually signals positive news because investors are cautious and tend to wait for more info before jumping in.

Now, considering the other tweets: they mention specific companies like YTM (Cyto), WDR (Wendy Deli), and PMSA (Pfizer's Simulation Assay). These are all relevant sectors or companies. While I don't have specific data on their performance this week, the fact that someone is monitoring these in the context of Amazon suggests they're looking at related developments.

Coh and Byi are platforms where tech firms and big names like Amazon might post updates about their products or market positions. If there's a breakaway event, especially around major announcements, it could indicate significant growth potential for Amazon. Investors often react positively when such events unfold because the stock is trading higher.

Putting it all together, the tweets are suggesting that monitoring certain platforms and specific companies could be worthwhile. This proactive approach can lead to positive sentiment as investors prepare their buy orders based on anticipated changes in the market."
2014-08-04,Positive,"Okay, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company based on the given rules. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the target stock is identified from the tweets. Looking at the tweets provided, none of them mention any specific stock symbol, so maybe that's not possible here. Alternatively, perhaps they're referring to a generic company or context, but without more information, it's hard to pinpoint. I might have missed something, so I'll proceed under the assumption that each tweet is about a different company or part of the same discussion.

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate the positive and negative factors. Let me go through them one by one.

1. The first tweet is ""$ alks are you looking to buy $ cmp $ dnb $ amzn financialnews URL."" It looks like this tweet is making a request or query related to buying stocks, probably about Alphabet Inc. (Amz). So, positive factors might include a general interest in Amz, and maybe negative if there's some pressure on their earnings.

2. The second tweet says ""rt AT_USER ' potential bounce ' for $ aapl $ nflx $ amzn $ googl URL."" Here, the user is suggesting that the stock prices could experience a bounce or a correction. This seems to be predicting an upward movement in Amz's price, so this would lean towards a positive sentiment.

3. The third tweet is ""is a correction near ? wall street on edge | URL $ tvix $ ^ vix vix $ amzn $ yhoo $ gm $ yum $ googl $ aapl $ wu $ t $ f $ wy $ wyn."" This seems to be from Wall Street about corrections, but the exact impact is unclear. It mentions several stocks and is setting up the context around potential market changes. I'm not sure if this adds positive or negative sentiment.

4. The fourth tweet is ""catalog stocks on lower note - URL inc . ( nasdaq : amzn ) , e ... $ amzn URL."" This seems to be making a suggestion about listing Amz on their catalog, perhaps indicating that the stock might rise in price. So again, this could be positive.

5. The fifth tweet says ""$ amzn getting the low volume pump job this morning."" It mentions Amz losing some trading volume, which might mean buying pressure is increasing or selling pressure is decreasing. This could indicate a potential increase in price, so it leans towards positive.

6. The sixth and seventh tweets are about U.S. tech companies founded by immigrants from 1st or 2nd generation. They're listing their stock prices but not making any predictions. It seems like just reporting data without sentiment, so maybe neutral since there's no prediction of movement in price.

Now, combining these thoughts:

- The first tweet is a query about buying stocks.
- The second tweet predicts an upward bounce.
- The third tweet sets context for market corrections.
- The fourth and fifth tweets suggest that Amz might rise.
- The sixth and seventh are just listing prices without sentiment.

Since the main impact seems to be on predicting a positive movement in Amz's stock price, which is suggested by multiple tweets, I think this would lead to a positive overall sentiment. However, the third tweet about Wall Street suggests there could be corrections, but without explicit information on how those would affect Amz, it's safer to focus on the tweets that directly relate to predictions or potential movements."
2014-08-05,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, I have these tweets about Amazon and Kemken. The user wants me to determine if each tweet will impact the stock price positively, neutrally, or negatively for a given company.

First, I need to break down each tweet. Each tweet is only three lines long, so it's not too many to process. Let me take them one by one.

The first tweet says: ""Amazon and Kemken took 18 months to reach a one-year book sales deal amzn url."" Hmm, that seems like a specific event related to Amazon expanding their books or e-commerce operations. I'm trying to think if this is positive or negative news for Amazon's stock. It sounds like they're working on something significant, which might be seen as good because it could lead to future growth. But wait, ""Kemken"" isn't a real company. Maybe the user meant Kemps? Or perhaps it's a typo. Regardless, even if it's not a recognized company, taking a 18-month deal for one-year sales is positive information. It shows expansion and ambition, which can boost confidence in future earnings. So I'd say this tweet adds value positively.

Now the second tweet: ""Amazon and Kemken took 18 months to reach a one-year book sales deal amzn url."" Wait, that's identical to the first one. It seems like it might be a copy-paste error or a mistake in the prompt. If the content is the same, then there's no new information here. So I should probably consider this tweet as not providing any relevant info because both tweets are repeating each other.

Putting them together, the first tweet adds positive news about Amazon expanding their sales, and the second one repeats that which doesn't add anything. Therefore, the overall sentiment is still positive for the company."
2014-08-06,Missing,File not found
2014-08-07,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this analysis. The user has provided two tweets about a company and wants to determine their impact on the stock price. First, I need to identify the target stock from these tweets.

Looking at the tweets, both mention ""barnes & noble"" and ""Google,"" along with Amazon's original business – books. So it seems like the target stock is related to Barnes & Noble or Amazon. But since they don't explicitly provide the stock symbol, I might need to look for something else. Maybe the tweets are linked to a specific product or company, but without more info, it's tricky. Wait, maybe it's about Amazon's books business? That could be a possibility.

Next, I'll break down each tweet to find Positive and Negative factors. 

The first tweet says: ""rt AT_USER barnes & noble and google are teaming up to compete in amazon's original business – books URL $ goog $ amzn $ bks"". It mentions Amazon's original business – books and talks about a partnership with Barnes & Noble and Google. I'm not sure if that's positive or negative.

The second tweet is the same as the first, probably being another variation of the same message to reach more users.

Now, assessing sentiment for each tweet: both seem positive because they're promoting collaboration and competition in Amazon's books business. They might be encouraging investors to consider this partnership.

Combining these analyses, since both tweets are reinforcing a potential collaboration that could boost the stock price, the overall sentiment is likely Positive."
2014-08-08,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. So, I have these tweets about Amazon and some other companies, and I need to determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative for the stock price impact.

First, I'll start by looking at each tweet one by one. The goal is to parse each tweet, separate the relevant information like stocks mentioned, identify positive and negative factors, and then assess the sentiment. Finally, combine all that into a single overall sentiment summary.

Let me look at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER barnes & noble and google are teaming up to compete in amazon's original business – books . URL $ goog $ amzn $ bks"". Hmm, it looks like a link where AT_USER is adding Barnes and Noble and Google for Amazon. The URLs here don't directly mention Amazon or the stock price changes, so maybe this tweet isn't particularly about the stock itself.

Next tweet: ""$ gluu market cap URL also see : $ amzn $ amt $ xlp $ nwgc ~"". This one mentions GLUU, which might be a tech stock, and includes AMZN. It seems like it's providing some metrics or data related to Amazon's performance. The mention of ""also see"" suggests that the tweet is offering insights or indicators about Amazon, but I don't have specific numbers here.

Third tweet: ""$ amzn trying"". This one just says ""try"" without any stock information. Maybe someone is experimenting with Amazon and thinks it's a good idea? It doesn't provide any positive or negative data, so maybe this is neutral because there's no clear indication of improvement or decline.

Fourth tweet: ""$ amzn $ googl $ bidu the stocks that we called strength in today . the structure was very clean for strength ."" This one has multiple stocks and mentions ""we called strength"". It could be a call to action, suggesting that AMZN is doing well. The phrase ""structure was very clean for strength"" might imply positive news about the company's operations or management. So this seems like a strong positive factor contributing to Amazon's stock.

Now, compiling all these thoughts: The first tweet isn't directly related. Second mentions AMZN but only with some data and not specific metrics. Third is speculative. Fourth clearly talks about ""we called strength"" and suggests that AMZN is doing well. So overall, the strongest indicator is the fourth tweet, which gives a positive outlook on Amazon.

Putting it all together: The tweet talks about someone's confidence in AMZN, which could be seen as a positive signal for investors who believe in AMZN's growth. Even though other tweets don't provide clear data, the sentiment seems positive because of the call to action and the positive remark towards strength. So I think the overall sentiment is Positive."

2014-08-10,Missing,File not found
2014-08-11,Neutral,"Alright, let's see what I need to do here. So, the user has provided five tweets and wants me to analyze their impact on Amazon's stock price by determining if they're positive, neutral, or negative. Okay, first things first, I remember that each tweet seems relevant because they mention Amazon, WMT, and some other companies.

Starting with the first tweet: ""Amazon’s third pilot season will premiere august 28 in the us and uk pilot episodes from critically-acclaimed creators including sh ..."". That sounds like it's talking about a new series or project coming out. Pilots are exciting stuff for shows; maybe that could attract more revenue, which Amazon might expect. So that's a positive sign.

Next tweet: ""PCLN $ LNKD AMZN"" – I'm not sure what these abbreviations stand for, but it looks like multiple stocks being traded or mentioned in the context of Amazon. Maybe this is a typo? If PCLN and LNKD are other companies, then perhaps they're related to Amazon's products or services. But since it doesn't specify positive or negative factors directly, I might have to assume that this could be neutral or speculative.

Third tweet: ""RT AT_USER AMAZON REPORTED 23% SALES INCREASE THIS YEAR BUT lost $126 million. Amzn down 22% this year. URL http …"". This looks like a financial report from Amazon, but with the text cut off. The numbers show that they had a 23% increase in sales and lost money, which could be negative news for Amazon's stock price. So I think this is negative.

Fourth tweet: ""RT AT_USER AMAZON REPORTED 23% SALES INCREASE THIS YEAR BUT lost $126 million. Amzn down 22% this year. URL http …"". Similar to the third tweet, it's repeating the same information but maybe with a different URL. So again, sales up and losses, which are negative factors.

Fifth tweet: ""AMAZON [ $ $ ] HACHette Pricing Battle Continues URL"". Hachette is known for marketing and media services; their pricing battles can be competitive events. If Amazon is involved in these deals, it might lead to increased revenue or increased costs depending on the strategy. This could influence stock price positively if they're taking advantage of opportunities or negatively if it's a bottleneck.

Now, putting it all together: The first tweet is positive about new content. The second and third tweets are speculative with numbers; probably neutral but not sure yet. The fourth is repeating the same info but different URL, so maybe negative. The fifth mentions a Hachette pricing battle, which could be positive or negative based on Amazon's position there.

So overall, I'm leaning towards some positive sentiment from the first tweet and a mix of factors in the others. But given that two of them are speculative and have uncertain implications, I might lean more towards neutral because I don't have strong data to support positive or negative."
2014-08-12,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. I've got five tweets here, and each seems like it could be influencing investor sentiment.

Starting with the first tweet: "" $ amzn is on my radar for a possible short position ."" That sounds like someone is considering buying shares of Amazon as a potential short position. That's interesting because holding a short position can influence stock prices. Maybe people are waiting to buy, so that might give Amazon a reason to raise the price or cause some pressure. Hmm, I'm not sure if that's positive or negative.

Next tweet: "" rt AT_USER amazon blocks preorders of disney dvds . bad move say our readers in our latest poll : $ amzn $ dis URL"" Okay, so someone is saying Amazon is blocking orders for Disney Disks. That seems like a negative thing because if Amazon stops buying Disney stocks, it could hurt the company's revenue or stock price. The user is making a move against them, and they're saying it's bad news. So that directly affects Amazon's performance.

Third tweet: "" $ amzn rackspace q2 revenue tops , execs mum on company sale URL"" This one says Amazon's rackspace in Q2 (second quarter) tops, which is good because more capacity means the company can handle more stock and potentially make more money. The execs are on a sale, but that could mean they're cutting costs or maybe giving discounts to customers. A sale might not necessarily be bad if it leads to increased sales or better margins, but I'm not sure how this affects Amazon's overall valuation.

Fourth tweet: "" rt AT_USER disney versus amazon : who needs who ? - stocks to watch - barron's $ dis $ amzn URL"" This is a comparison between Disney and Amazon. It seems like the user is talking about which stock to watch based on what others are saying. This could be part of a strategic move, but it doesn't directly mention anything negative or positive regarding Amazon's price movement.

Fifth tweet: "" $ amzn pe back up to 816 . obviously some will keep pouring money into this until they run out of cash ... which could happen by year end ."" So, the price is rising and there's a word about cash running out. This could mean that as people have more money, they might buy more shares before their finances dwindle. More shares bought during an upward trend can drive up stock prices, so maybe this could lead to a positive impact on Amazon's future price.

Putting it all together: The first tweet suggests someone is looking for short positions. That could create pressure or increase the likelihood of Amazon being bought by others. However, the second tweet is clearly bad news because Amazon is blocking Disney's stock, which directly impacts their performance. The third and fifth tweets are about potential positive things but don't seem to be causing a significant effect on Amazon's price. The fourth tweet is more about comparison and doesn't add much sentiment.

So, the main negative factors here are from the second tweet— Amazon losing preorders for Disney. This could reduce demand or affect their revenue, which might lower Amazon's stock price. Even though there are positive tweets, they don't outweigh this significant negative impact mentioned in the second tweet."
2014-08-13,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out how the given tweets affect Amazon's stock price and determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol, I see ""amzn"" in multiple tweets. That’s good because it tells me which company we're focusing on.

Now, let me go through each tweet one by one and analyze their impact.

1. The first tweet says $ amzn sube a $226 with a +2.06% gain. A positive percentage increase is a classic indicator of strength, so that's definitely good for Amazon.

2. The second tweet mentions optionmillionaires agreeing and talking about the bad close affecting Amazon. It seems like Amazon might have issues closing its options quickly. That could lead to a negative sentiment as investors might be concerned about the impact on their investments.

3. The third tweet talks about a new mobile-payment service targeting PayPal and Square, which are financial services companies. This suggests that Amazon is expanding into more payment methods. But I'm not sure if this directly affects Amazon's stock price unless it introduces new competitors or disrupts current revenue streams.

4. The fourth tweet says there's a short-term weakness which could create a buying opportunity. A temporary dip in earnings might allow Amazon to capitalize on later gains, but it's unclear if this is a significant factor affecting the overall sentiment.

5. The fifth tweet talks about grub being an all-time high and $ amzn and $ goog seeming like a good fit for someone. Grubbing is related to restaurant services; maybe this is a positive sign? Or could it be misleading? Not sure yet.

6. The sixth tweet mentions amendments by grub, making it look good, but then it suggests $ amzn and $ goog are good fits for investing. This seems like another sign that the company might be underperforming or in a down cycle, which is bad news.

7. The seventh tweet talks about Amazon taking on PayPal and Square with their new payment app. If Amazon is acquiring established competitors, it could lead to expansion and possibly higher margins, which would be positive for investors.

8. The eighth tweet lists early movers but doesn't provide much else. It might not have a direct impact unless Amazon is leading in certain areas, which isn't clear yet.

9. A Twitter backlist entry about $ amzn and $ ebay being oversold stocks could cause more selling pressure, potentially negative sentiment as the market may fear overvaluation.

10. The ninth tweet mentions $10 business for shopping offline, implying that Amazon is offering a new way to buy products online without in-store pickup. This seems like a strategic move to increase customer engagement or sales, which could be positive but might also indicate potential risks if it's seen as an acquisition.

11. The tenth tweet corrects oversold conditions and suggests buying at dips. If the market is overvalued due to high valuations, selling down could hurt Amazon's stock.

12. The eleventh tweet launches a card reader or app allowing merchants to take credit/debit cards from mobile devices. This would directly increase their revenue streams for consumers, which is positive news and likely increases demand.

13. The twelfth tweet mentions July sales up 40% in $ amzn, while other indexes like $ ebay down 9.7%. A strong performance in Amazon's core business could boost investor confidence and sentiment positively.

Now, putting it all together: the tweets from AMZN are either positive (5-12) or have mixed sentiments (2-4). The overall trend seems to be a mix of positive news about expansion and strategic moves. However, some tweets like 6 and 7 suggest underlying issues that might affect sentiment more.

I think there's enough good info here—strong sales numbers, strategic expansions, and positive financial performance—but the mixed responses in others mean it's not entirely clear-cut. It's probably a mix of positive factors but with potential minor negatives. So I'm leaning towards [Neutral]."
2014-08-14,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of Amazon. First, I need to extract the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the tweets provided:

1. ""are you bullish on these stocks $ luk $ bby $ inta $ amzn view now URL"" – The main stock here seems to be AMZN (Amazon), but it's a bit unclear because of multiple stock names. 

2. ""go $ amzn go ! still has room to run .” – Here, the target is AMZN again.

3. ""will URL inc . ( amzn ) ' s be able to bully the walt disney company ( dis ) ? $ amzn url"" – This one mentions AMZN and Walth Dis, so likely AMZN.

4. ""closing winning long on $ amzn . entered on 2014-08- 01 , position is up 6.26 % [ eod ] ."" – Clearly targets AMZN.

5. ""rt AT_USER if you're looking for e-books , skip amazon . you'll be better off getting a library card : url $ amzn url"" – This tweet seems to be an invitation or a link, but it doesn't mention the target stock except through other tweets that might reference it. Maybe AMZN is implied here.

6. ""$ amzn : why url ( amzn ) stock is higher today url url"" – Again, targets AMZN.

So all relevant tweets are about Amazon stock. Now, I need to analyze each tweet for positive, negative, or neutral factors.

Starting with the first tweet: ""are you bullish on these stocks $ luk $ bby $ inta $ amzn view now URL."" It's a bit ambiguous, but mentions AMZN in multiple places and says ""bullish on these stocks."" That sounds like good information. But since it's not clear if it's boosting or just confirming sentiment.

Second tweet: ""go $ amzn go ! still has room to run .” This seems more speculative. It's a bit vague, but the phrase ""still has room to run"" might imply that AMZN is strong and could continue moving higher, which would be positive for the stock price.

Third tweet: ""will URL inc . ( amzn ) ' s be able to bully the walt disney company ( dis ) ? $ am zn url."" This seems like a warning or a comment about competitors. If Walt Dis is being bullyinged, it could indicate financial issues or potential risks for AMZN. That might have negative implications.

Fourth tweet: ""closing winning long on $ amzn . entered on 2014-08- 01 , position is up 6.26 % [ eod ] ."" This clearly states that Amazon's stock has closed higher, so it's showing a positive trend in price movement.

Fifth tweet: ""rt AT_USER if you're looking for e-books , skip amazon . you'll be better off getting a library card : url $ am zn url."" The link seems promotional but not directly about AMZN. Maybe related to some aspect of Amazon, like their business strategy or products? It's unclear.

Sixth tweet: ""$ amzn : why url ( amzn ) stock is higher today url url"" – Similar to the first one, this is vague and could be a sign that the stock is performing well.

Now, considering all these tweets, some are confirming positive sentiment about AMZN, others mention competitors or potential issues. But without concrete data like news articles or expert opinions, it's hard to assess the overall impact definitively.

However, looking at the context of the first tweet: ""bullish on these stocks,"" which is a positive statement. The second tweet suggests AMZN is in good shape. The third might be a warning but seems negative if Walt Dis is under pressure. Fourth clearly shows a positive price movement. The fifth could be related to a product strategy, and sixth is vague.

Given that several tweets are indicating a positive outlook or confirming some aspect of the stock, maybe the overall sentiment leans towards positive. But it's a bit speculative because one tweet might be misleading or just a tip-off."
2014-08-15,Positive,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by breaking down each tweet and analyzing their potential effects.

1. The first tweet says there are another 10 points before a major resistance. That sounds like good news because more points usually mean strength ahead. So, this could be positive.
2. The second tweet mentions various stocks, but it's not clear how they relate to Amazon or the stock price directly. Without context, I can't say much about this one.
3. The third tweet talks about research on stocks related to Amazon, which again doesn't give any information specific about Amazon's performance.
4. The fourth tweet discusses NASDAQ 100 performance but lists companies that don't include Amazon or anything related directly to their price movement.
5. This tweet says there's no threat to the visa. I know that the US is dealing with sanctions from China, which could impact the US market and possibly Amazon if they're involved in tech supply chains.
6. The fifth tweet suggests focusing on price without competition, but it also lists Tesla and Microsoft, so this might indicate a lack of competition, which can be a negative sign for Amazon's sales.
7. The sixth tweet is about Wayfair going public, which could affect the broader tech sector but doesn't mention Amazon specifically or its stock price directly.
8. The seventh tweet mentions a convoy attack on August 15th, which is an event that might affect logistics companies but not major tech firms like Amazon.
9. This tweet suggests selling Amazon stocks as a strategy, but again, without specific data or context, it's hard to predict the impact on the stock price.
10. The last tweet advises against getting a library card if looking for e-books from Amazon, which could influence consumer behavior and maybe the overall company's brand perception, though I'm not sure how that translates to stock performance.

Putting it all together: Most tweets are positive in terms of trends or market positions but one (number 5) suggests potential risks due to sanctions. The rest don't seem directly related. Since there's some positive news and a bit of negative speculation about supply chain threats, the overall sentiment leans slightly towards positive but with some uncertainty from that single point."
2014-08-16,Positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out how to determine the impact on Amazon's stock price based on these tweets. Let me start by understanding what each tweet is about.

First tweet: ""are you investing in $ cpn $ hp $ nrg $ amzn singedinvestor URL"". Hmm, looks like it's asking if someone is considering investments in a few stocks but isn't specific about which ones or the context. The mention of Singiinvestor could be a typo; maybe they meant something else. This tweet seems more like an informational query rather than providing any positive or negative information.

Second tweet: ""$ amzn target and best buy start holiday shopping early URL"". Here, it's talking about Amazon as a target and suggesting people should start holiday shopping earlier. This seems to be a promotional message encouraging people to make decisions before the holidays. Positive sentiment is expected here because promoting future events usually leads to increased trading.

Third tweet: ""great stock newsletter on $ ccl $ fis $ clr $ amzn must have URL"". It's another email or announcement from Amazon. The mention of ""must have"" might suggest it's a product or service they're offering, which could indicate positive sentiment as people might be interested in the benefits.

Fourth tweet: ""$ amzn : amazon ( amzn ) launches mobile payment service local register URL"". This seems like an announcement about a new product launch. It's promoting a feature that could lead to increased sales and market share, which would generally increase stock price. The mention of a mobile payment service suggests it's addressing some user needs or convenience, possibly boosting demand.

Now, combining all these thoughts: The second tweet is positive with holiday shopping promotion. The third tweet is another positive as it's likely an announcement on Amazon's products. The fourth tweet is also positive about a new feature expected to improve services. The first tweet is more of a casual question that doesn't provide specific info.

So overall, the tweets are all reinforcing positive trends and promotional messages, which should lead to a positive impact on Amazon's stock price."
2014-08-17,Neutral,"Alright, so I need to figure out how the given tweets affect the stock price of a company. Let me start by analyzing each tweet step by step.

The first tweet says something about ""10 companies control the internet"" and mentions multiple stocks like GOOG, MSFT, FB, YHOO, WIKIMEDIA, and AMZN. It seems to indicate that these 10 companies have significant influence over the internet traffic of $40%. But I'm not sure how this directly relates to stock prices unless it's a tip or advisory about something else, but as it stands, it doesn't seem like it's predicting a move in the stock price.

The second tweet is a bit confusing. It says ""AT_USER washpo inserting $ amzn"" and mentions buying buttons into articles via URL RT. I don't recognize this language; maybe it's a typo or some kind of link. The mention of AMZN probably relates to its stock, but without more context, it's hard to tell if it's positive or negative.

The third tweet talks about holding stocks like CLWHA and ZNGA on NASDAQ, with prices set at $PNRA. This seems speculative as well. There's no information about how this affects the company's stock price or financial performance.

Since I can't find any direct links to the company's financial reports, earnings, or other indicators that could indicate a positive or negative impact on their stock price, my best guess is that these tweets don't provide enough information for me to assess the stock's sentiment. Therefore, it's neutral."
2014-08-18,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. So, the user has provided some tweets and wants to know their impact on a stock's future price based on just one tweet each. Hmm, that seems tricky because one tweet doesn't give enough context or information about the company.

First, I need to understand what the user is asking for. They want me to analyze each tweet and determine if it affects the stock positively, neutrally, or negatively. But since they only provide a single tweet per analysis, I can't get much beyond that. It's like looking at one brick in a wall—just part of the picture.

I should consider why this is important. Stock market predictions are based on a lot of factors: company performance, industry trends, economic indicators, management quality, etc. Each tweet contributes a piece of that puzzle. Without context from other tweets or additional data, I can't make an informed guess about the stock's future price.

Let me think about possible reasons why someone would provide just one tweet for this analysis. Maybe they're testing if I understand how to do sentiment analysis, but even then, it's limited. Or perhaps they want a quick summary without looking at more data points.

I also wonder if there's any assumption being made here. For example, could the tweet be related to a specific stock? But in this case, each tweet doesn't mention which company or what information is provided about them.

Additionally, the output requires using one of three tags: Positive, Neutral, or Negative. That seems too simplistic for predicting market trends, as that would require knowing more than just the tweet itself.

So, my thought process is to recognize that I can't determine stock price impact solely from a single tweet. It's beyond basic sentiment analysis. Therefore, the output needs to state that without more context and data, it's impossible to predict the future stock price impact of any given tweet."
2014-08-19,Negative,"Alright, I need to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by breaking down each tweet.

First, the target stock is Amazon (AMZN). Now, looking at each tweet individually.

The first tweet says ""am zn chart : amzn . URL"". Hmm, that doesn't seem like a meaningful tweet about AMZN. It might be an error or typo in the URL. I should probably skip this one since it doesn't provide any relevant information.

The second tweet is ""rt AT_USER a chinese e-commerce site is starting to look a lot like AT_USER $ amzn $ jd AT_USER URL"". This looks like a link request from someone on Twitter (RT). They're talking about a Chinese e-commerce site that's similar to Amazon. But I don't have any specific information about this website or its relevance to AMZN. It might be a placeholder, so I can't make much of it.

The third tweet is ""rt AT_USER investors want to know--what's amazon's plan ? URL $ amzn url"". Again, RT and some links. The main question here is whether Amazon is in the process of revealing its plans. But without specific details about what they're planning, I can't assess the sentiment much.

Overall, none of these tweets provide concrete information that would significantly impact AMZN's stock price. They're either incomplete or targeting non-relevant content. Therefore, I don't see any positive, negative, or neutral factors here."
2014-08-20,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet mentions that Amazon has sufficient cloud compute and the CEO dumped $982k worth of shares. That sounds like a significant negative event because selling shares can hurt a company, especially after making an investment decision.

2. The second tweet talks about Fold upgrading to a strong buy on Amicus Therapeutics with positive phase 3 data from Fabry Monotherapy. This seems like a positive sign for the company, which is generally good for investors and stock price.

3. The third tweet asks if Amazon's drones are being sent to India, leading to an ""URL."" It looks like this could be a joke or claim about something else unrelated, so it doesn't seem relevant to the stock performance.

4. The fourth tweet mentions that Amazon is competing with the world and references URLs related to AmZN. There's no clear information here; it seems vague and speculative.

Now, combining these factors: two tweets are positive (Fold's move and maybe another hidden positive in some context), one negative (Amazon selling shares) and one unrelated or not providing any relevant info. The majority isn't overwhelmingly negative but has a mix of positive and negative elements. This might not be enough to strongly influence the stock price, so the overall sentiment is neutral."
2014-08-21,Positive,"Alright, I need to determine how these tweets affect Amazon's future stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the tweet ""Amazon ramps up China presence URL $ amzn."" It mentions the increase in their presence in China and a $ amount. Since it's an informational tweet that updates market sentiment about Amazon's expansion into a key market, this is definitely positive for investors who see growth potential. So, I'll mark this as Positive.

Next, ""Amazon gets $50M investment in $X dividend."" This shows Amazon receiving money to invest in dividends. Dividends are seen as a good sign because it gives customers more value and can boost earnings. Therefore, the positive impact here should make me lean towards a Positive conclusion.

Lastly, ""Amazon's net profit for Q3 is $12B."" A strong quarterly profit indicates financial health and future potential. Since Amazon is a major player in the tech industry, a steady or increasing profit directly supports their growth prospects. This tweet reinforces the positive sentiment.

Putting it all together, all three tweets are positive factors that contribute to Amazon's success. Therefore, the overall impact should be Positive."
2014-08-22,Neutral,"Okay, I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of TSLA (Amazon) based on the given criteria. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet, it seems like the stock symbol is ""tsla"" because that's the name of Amazon. So, TSLA is our focus here.

Next, for each relevant tweet, I have to separate positive and negative factors. Let me go through each one:

1. "" $ kndi green and at hod . $ tsla $ ttm $ jd $ fb $ mu $ f $ gm $ aa $ goog $ jrjc $ amzn $ ddd $ ssys $ fcel $ bldp $ gpro $ siri $ nflx $ jpm $ scty $ nrg $ onvo "" — Hmm, the term ""kndi green and at hod"" doesn't ring a bell for factors related to TSLA. ""Ttm,"" ""jd,"" ""fb,"" etc., are other stocks or indicators, not relevant to TSLA.

2. ""$ qld tick URL also see : $ cop $ x $ cprx $ amzn ~"" – This one mentions QLTD and Copysing as a URL. Not directly related to TSLA, so probably no factors here.

3. ""$ how to avoid picking stock direction URL $ amzn $ fb $ twtr"" – Similar issue, talking about amzn and twtr, which aren't related to TSLA.

Now, I need to assess the sentiment of each tweet towards TSLA. Let's see:

For the first tweet, there are no mentions of TSLA except for ""amzn,"" which is a competitor but not directly related. Maybe negative if amzn is being referred to as a competitor or downgrades it.

The second and third tweets don't mention TSLA at all. So, their sentiment towards TSLA is neutral because they're talking about unrelated topics.

Since none of the tweets explicitly mention TSLA, we have zero positive, no negative, and no neutral impact. Therefore, the overall sentiment is Neutral."
2014-08-23,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze the provided tweets and determine their impact on the future stock price of a company. The user has given me a specific set of tweets, but looking at them closely, it seems like they're all URLs pointing to a single stock symbol: 'XLI' or something similar. 

First, I should identify the target stock. However, since all the tweets are structured as URL links with symbols like $amzn, $apl, etc., it's unclear which specific company we're focusing on here. This might mean that the analysis isn't about a particular company but rather a general impact of these URLs or market conditions.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one. The first tweet is ""URL danrocks : $ amzn alert $ aapl $ panw $ cus.to $ lhpt $ xli : danrocks URL URL"". This seems to be part of a list or feed where the user is highlighting upcoming stock price alerts for specific companies: Amazon, Apple, Procter & Gamble, Cuscore, LinkedIn, and Xinhua. The fact that it's labeled as an 'amzn alert' could imply concerns about Amazon's performance, but without knowing which company is being referred to, I'm not sure if this translates to a single stock or multiple.

Since all the tweets are part of a URL feed for various companies, maybe each tweet is suggesting something different. If these were individual stock price alerts, the sentiment might vary based on each tweet's content. For example, some could mention positive trends, others negative.

However, without knowing which company is being referred to in each tweet, it's challenging to assess a single stock's impact. The URLs suggest an alphabetical list or multiple items, but without context linking them to a specific stock, it's impossible to determine if they're about the same company or different ones.

Given that all tweets are part of a URL feed for various companies and not individual stock price updates from a single company, I can't conclusively evaluate whether these tweets will positively, neutrally, or negatively impact any particular stock. The lack of specificity in each tweet makes it hard to assess the overall sentiment without more information.

Therefore, my conclusion is that without additional context linking these URLs to specific stocks, the analysis isn't feasible for determining a single stock's impact."
2014-08-24,Negative,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. So, I need to analyze a set of tweets about a company's stock price impact and determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative. The user has provided specific steps outlined in the ""Solving Process"" section, which includes identifying the target stock symbol from each tweet and then analyzing each tweet's factors and sentiment.

First, I need to figure out what the target stock is based on these tweets. Looking at tweet 1: ""$ fcel e . p . s . URL also see : $ rfmd $ amzn $ hain $ hog ~"". Hmm, that seems like a misspelling of ""Amazon."" Let me verify that. Yes, $rfmd is Amazon's symbol. So the target stock is Amazon (AMZN). 

Now, moving on to analyzing each tweet one by one. The user provided only one tweet here, but maybe I'm missing some? Or perhaps they intended multiple tweets. But for now, let's focus on what's given.

First tweet: ""$ fcel e . p . s . URL also see : $ rfmd $ amzn $ hain $ hog ~"". Okay, it looks like a bunch of other companies mentioned, but no direct reference to Amazon or any specific stock symbol. It's quite confusing because the tweets don't specify which stock they're talking about.

Wait, maybe there are multiple tweets provided? Let me check again. No, it just shows one tweet with some unrelated symbols and text. That seems odd because each tweet should be targeting a specific stock. Perhaps it's an oversight or a mistake in formatting. Maybe the user intended to provide more than one tweet but only included this one.

Given that ambiguity, I might need to consider what could make sense here. If the target stock is Amazon (AMZN), then none of these tweets directly mention it. Therefore, without knowing which specific stock is being referred to, it's impossible to determine its impact on their future price. The provided information isn't sufficient for analysis.

But since the user has only one tweet and specifies ""the given company,"" I'm assuming that each tweet relates to that company. So in this case, none of the tweets specify a particular stock symbol related to the target company. Therefore, it's impossible to assess their impact on the stock price based solely on these tweets.

In such cases, perhaps the user intended to include multiple relevant tweets for more information or different aspects of the same tweet. Alternatively, maybe one of the tweets is the only one mentioning a specific stock that could be associated with the company. However, from what's provided here, I don't see any such mention.

So, considering all this, it seems like without knowing which stock symbol is being referred to in these tweets, I can't determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative regarding that stock's price impact. The lack of specific context makes the analysis incomplete and unreliable.

Therefore, my conclusion is that there isn't enough information provided to assess the sentiment of the provided tweets with respect to a particular company. It would be best to provide more relevant tweets targeting the specific company in question."
2014-08-25,Negative,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. 

First, I need to identify each tweet as positive, negative, or neutral based on the factors and sentiment mentioned. The target stock seems to be Amazon (AMZN). 

Looking at the first few tweets, they're all about AT_USER making breaks for AMZN. Each one mentions a full press release where AMZN is acquiring Twitch, which is a gaming platform. People watching other people play video games sounds like it's positive because it might attract more subscribers or customers.

There are several tweets suggesting that AMZN will pay more than $1 billion for the video game site. Some mention being less than a billion but still over a billion, indicating some interest in the price and potential growth. Others have similar content about potential future moves with other companies like Google and YouTube, implying a thought process on how different companies might influence each other.

There's one tweet that suggests people think what AMZN will do is vastly different from what Google or YouTube would have done. This indicates that there's some consideration of the broader market impact, which could be positive if it reflects investor confidence in future strategies.

However, multiple tweets mention cash deals and potential press releases, which are negative because they directly affect cash flow. The fact that AMZN is considering significant payments to other companies, especially video game platforms, adds to the expectation of growth or value proposition.

So overall, while there's some positive sentiment about the company and potential expansion, the negative tweets about cash deals and future moves could weigh the impact negatively. However, the positive mentions like potential large purchases suggest that Amazon might benefit in the long run despite short-term issues."
2014-08-26,Neutral,"Alright, so I need to analyze these tweets about Amazon and determine their impact on the stock price. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions a gaming website's Twitch channel for entertainment. That seems like a positive thing because more people are watching online, which can boost sales. So that's positive.

2. The second tweet says $AMZN will be the only profitable thing at $AMZN. That sounds very encouraging and positive because it's looking like Amazon could make money, so investors think they're doing well.

3. This one talks about an alert on their chat related to a URL. It doesn't specify what that is, but if there's something profitable or significant going on, it might be positive. The URL mention suggests some action, so maybe positive sentiment.

4. This tweet refers to Amazon paying $1 billion for content to watch video games. That’s a direct financial deal, which could boost the company's revenue. Positive impact.

5. The fifth tweet is confusing because ""they should have sold at $GOOG."" It seems like they thought it would go up but didn't, which might lead to negative sentiment since investors were expecting more price, and this one is going down. Negative sentiment from the expectation of lower prices.

6. This tweet suggests that Amazon isn’t making much profit because their ads are too good, or maybe they're not doing enough ads. That could mean negative sentiment because it's unclear if Amazon is doing well.

7. The tweet about 140% profits and offers to choose chooo chooo. That sounds positive as it indicates strong profitability. Positive impact.

8. It mentions Amazon being a ""worst buy."" If Amazon isn't giving value, that could be negative because users might think they're paying too much or not getting good deals. Negative sentiment based on poor value perception.

9. Shorting Amazon today suggests that the tweet itself is a recommendation to short the stock, which is speculative and carries risk. So negative sentiment from this recommendation.

10. The tweet talks about $AMZN alert going up quickly after an alert was sent. That sounds positive because it's showing they're responsive to news, which can boost sales. Positive sentiment.

11. This tweet questions if Amazon gets cheaper for using Twitch. If the cost decreases due to being cheaply used, that could be seen as positive. So positive impact.

12. The tweet congratulates AT_USER and Amazon. It's a positive note about their success or community support. Positive sentiment.

13. Similar to tweet 7, this one also mentions 20,000 viewers of the town hall, which is another sign of strong performance. Positive impact.

14. This tweet just says $AMZN buying Twitch for free money. That's more about the action itself than selling. It's speculative and doesn't indicate a clear direction. So negative sentiment because it introduces uncertainty.

15. The tweet mentions that Amazon's nasdaq index is set to enter Google, which could cause a sell-off as investors see Google gaining market share. Negative sentiment due to expected sell-off.

16. This one talks about summer doldrums and long-term highs in the stock but doesn't mention anything directly related to Amazon or $AMZN. It's more of a general market trend without specific information. So neutral, though it suggests overall market uncertainty.

17. The tweet mentions a CEO starting to use $AMZN for AWS infrastructure, which could improve their monetization and user base. Positive impact as it shows potential growth.

18. This one is too vague; it talks about various stock tickers but doesn't specify an action or plan. It's speculative, so negative sentiment because of lack of concrete info.

19. The tweet simply confirms that $AMZN bought AT_USER for cash. It's more about confirming the transaction rather than providing information. So speculative and negative as it introduces risk without delivering any insight into Amazon's future performance.

After going through each tweet, most are positive or neutral in their implications, especially tweets 2,3,4,7,10,11,13,14,16,18 which seem to suggest positive outcomes. However, some like tweet 5 and 9 are negative due to expectations of price changes or risk. So overall sentiment is mostly neutral with a few positive signs."
2014-08-27,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by breaking down each tweet one by one.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. The word ""amzn"" is in multiple tweets, so that must be the stock we're focusing on: Amazon Inc.

Now, for each tweet, I'll separate the factors and assess the sentiment. Here's what each tweet says:

1. ""rt AT_USER by the AT_USER calculations : amazon has sold no more than 35,000 fire phones , data suggests URL $ amzn"" — This seems like a positive tweet. It mentions selling a lot of phones and expects a higher price, which is good for Amazon's revenue.

2. ""$ amzn amazon to debut jill soloway's highly-anticipated dark comedy transparent on september 26 in the us and from our stock news alerts app"" — This sounds promising. The tweet is ahead-of-time about a new project and is providing updates, which should boost investor interest.

3. ""rt AT_USER breaking : amazon just bought AT_USER for $ 970 million in cash . $ amzn"" — Another positive announcement. Amazon purchasing another company's stock can signal growth potential, so this is a good sign.

4. ""$ amzn - tech stocks : facebook leads tech stocks lower URL"" — Facebook has been a big player in the tech sector. If they're leading others down, it could negatively impact Amazon's tech stock performance.

5. ""$ amzn - tech stocks : facebook leads tech stocks lower URL"" — This is just reiterating the same point from tweet 4. It seems like the tech stocks are performing well with Facebook ahead of them.

6. ""3 retail etfs to consider heading into year-end sales $ amzn $ cost $ fdo URL via AT_USER"" — This sounds speculative, but mentions a company they're considering for investment, which could be good news if Amazon is doing well.

7. ""rt AT_USER swat post ' $ amzn new hod ... go go go ' on URL URL"" — I'm not sure what this tweet is about, but the phrase suggests something positive or exciting, possibly related to Amazon's stock performance.

Now, summarizing each tweet's impact:

1. Positive: Higher sales and expected revenue.
2. Promising project ahead of time.
3. Announced purchase, which can be seen as good news for Amazon.
4. Tech stocks are leading others in tech, which could negatively affect Amazon if they perform well.
5. Reiterating that Facebook is doing well in tech.
6. Considering investing in a company before the year ends, but not sure about the specifics.
7. Possibly another positive announcement that I'm not fully clear on.

The overall sentiment seems to be a mix of positives and some negatives. However, the most significant factor is the purchase announcement (tweet 3) which directly affects Amazon's revenue and could improve their financial health, making it a strong indicator of positive impact."
2014-08-28,Negative,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact on Amazon's stock price based on the given tweets. Let me start by breaking down each tweet and analyzing them one by one.

First, I need to identify the target stock mentioned in each tweet. That seems straightforward—just the stock name. 

1. The first tweet mentions ""$ amzn $ aapl pe ratio , its uses and limitations . URL bullish."" So, the target stock here is Ampleforth Acquisition, Inc., or maybe Ampleforth Acquisition (AMPL). It has something to do with the PE ratio and mentions things like ""uses and limitations."" Not sure yet what that means, but it's probably about their current business strategy.

2. The second tweet is a retweet of ""rt AT_USER could macy's beat amazon to same-day delivery ?"" So, the target stock here is Amazon (AMZN). The user is saying something about Apple's performance compared to Amazon for same-day deliveries. Hmm, I don't have much information on that, but maybe it relates to their product performance.

3. The third tweet says ""can amazon afford twitch ? URL $ aapl apple $ coup $ nflx $ ostk $ amzn."" Again, the target is AMPL. This seems like a question about whether Amazon can afford Twitch, which might be related to their content creation or media platforms. So, maybe it's about their capacity for new services.

4. The fourth tweet has ""$ amzn stock quote , 12:17 pm : 340.00 -3.18 ( -0.93 % ) . "" This looks like a news snippet where Amazon is trading at $340.00, down by around 3%. The percentage change is negative, so that's a significant decline in price.

Now, I need to assess the sentiment of each tweet regarding Amazon and then combine them into an overall impact.

1. The first tweet says ""URL bullish."" That could mean they're positively outlooked on AMPL or their operations, but not sure about Ampleforth Acquisition itself yet.
2. The second tweet is a retweet of a question about same-day delivery performance by Apple. If it's related to Amazon's performance in that area, maybe this indicates positive sentiment if they're doing better than competitors. But without context on how it affects their overall stock, hard to say.
3. The third tweet asks if Amazon can afford Twitch. This is more of a business question about their content strategy or services. It might not be strongly positive or negative towards the stock yet.
4. The fourth tweet shows a significant drop in price from $336.82 to $340.00, which is a -3.18% change. That's a clear downward move by 3%, which could indicate either support from buyers or fear of price increases, but it doesn't provide enough context on how this affects Ampleforth Acquisition.

Looking at the sentiment of each tweet:

- The first and third tweets are more about questions and statements without strong positive or negative language.
- The second is a retweet that's neutral towards AMZN.
- The fourth clearly shows a significant price decrease, which could be seen as both positive (buying lower) and negative (selling higher), but since it's a market movement, the sentiment is likely negative because of the drop.

So combining all four tweets: Two positive statements about Ampleforth Acquisition, one neutral retweet on Amazon, and one significant downward stock price move. The overall sentiment might lean towards Negative because there's a clear decline in price, which can be interpreted as a negative signal for buyers but also a possible signal of strength from sellers.

Therefore, I would conclude that the overall impact is Negative."
2014-08-29,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I should identify the target stock from each tweet. The common symbol in all is $AMZN, which is Amazon. So that's the company we're focusing on.

Now, let's go through each tweet one by one to see what they're saying and their factors.

1. ""no one actually thinks $ amzn can beat $ googl in search right ? this divergence is a sucker’s trap ? ok . glad we cleared that up . long $ googl"" – The user is talking about stock trading strategies, mentions Google (GOOG), says it's a sucker's trap, and suggests continuing withgoog. I think this tweet is more about strategy and possibly investor advice rather than affecting the stock price directly.

2. ""i think i'd like to buy some $ amzn calls when the pps is 328-330 wishfulthinking"" – This looks like a call option advice. It's about investing in Amazon stock, predicting its price will be between 328 and 330 points, which might affect investor sentiment but not necessarily the stock price itself.

3. ""dennyt : de insider disclosure $ de $ qihu $ amzn $ plug $ ptah URL"" – This seems like an insider update or a clue about Amazon's operations or strategies. Insiders can influence public opinion and might lead to changes in stock behavior, but it's a bit vague without more context.

4. ""$ amzn news alert : URL updated options view : URL all options views : URL"" – Similar to the previous ones, this is probably related to news alerts about Amazon. They might update their system for options trading or provide real-time information that could impact investor reactions but not directly the stock price.

5. ""track trending assets in 1 watchlist usd / jpy $ nasdaq $ amzn usdchf gbpusd URL"" – This is another news alert about trending assets, specifically in USD/JPY and NASDAQ indices. It might influence market sentiment but again, not a direct impact on Amazon's stock price.

6. ""$ amzn [ $ $ ] a brave new world of e-publishing confronts the old URL"" – This tweet uses a joke or metaphor suggesting that Amazon is moving into e-publishing, which could be seen as a positive outlook for their future products and growth areas but not necessarily affecting the current stock price.

After analyzing each tweet, it seems like none of them directly mention anything about Amazon's financial performance, earnings, or specific product developments. They are more about strategies, investments, or updates that might influence investor sentiment but have minimal direct impact on Amazon's stock price. 

Therefore, considering all these factors, the overall sentiment is neutral because there doesn't seem to be any significant positive or negative information in the tweets."
2014-08-30,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on a given company's stock price. Let me start by understanding what each tweet is about.

The first tweet mentions $ bidu, $cnx, $mmm, etc., which I think are abbreviations for stock ticker symbols like BIDU, CNX, etc. So it seems to be a list of companies being traded or listed as of today.

Looking at the second and third tweets, both mention ""don't trade"" followed by some kind of offer: ""click to make 100% per year with 'top 10 hedge fund' AI."" The words like ""trader,"" ""hedged,"" ""AI"" suggest that the author is promoting a trading strategy. 

Since these tweets encourage daily trading, they might be suggesting that investing in stocks, especially those listed in the first tweet's list, could potentially yield high returns if followed through. If someone starts trading, it can influence investor sentiment positively because more people are actively involved.

I should consider both positive and negative factors. Positive: High volume trading and a clear incentive for daily participation would likely boost the stock price. Negative: The emphasis on ""top 10 hedge fund"" might imply risk management or safety, which could be a downside if the strategy is risky or not well-researched.

Putting it all together, the tweets are offering high-risk, high-reward opportunities but emphasize that they're part of a strategy that requires careful execution. This combination suggests there's both hope and potential for loss, making the overall sentiment neutral."
2014-08-31,Neutral,"Okay, so I'm trying to analyze these tweets to figure out if they'll affect the stock price of a company. The user provided some tweets and wants me to determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative in impact. Let's break this down step by step.

First, looking at each tweet individually. I need to identify two things for each tweet: the target stock symbol and then separate the factors into positive and negative. After that, assess how each factor might influence investor sentiment. Finally, combine all these to get an overall conclusion.

Starting with the first tweet: ""AT_USER 60 % biggest US tech companies founded 1st / 2nd generation immigrants : URL mt $ aapl $ googl $ ibm $ fb $ amzn"". Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. The word ""AT_USER"" is mentioned, which I think stands for Apple, considering it's the symbol. So maybe it's pointing out that Apple is one of the biggest US tech companies founded by immigrants from the U.S.? But looking at the rest, it mentions several companies like Tesla (TSLA) and Facebook (FB), which are big tech companies.

Now, I need to identify factors here. The phrase ""60 % biggest US tech companies founded 1st / 2nd generation immigrants"" might mean that Apple is one of these companies, so that's a positive factor. However, the others like Tesla and Facebook could be considered as other factors. But wait, the user provided only this tweet. So maybe it's just pointing out that Apple is among them. Then the rest are URLs for different stocks.

As for sentiment, each tweet seems to present information about companies founded by immigrants in the U.S., which might imply potential growth or presence in the industry, hence positive factors. However, the overall impact on stock price? I'm not sure if it's too specific or broad enough to conclude definitively. But since some are positives and others aren't specified, maybe the sentiment is a mix.

Next tweet: ""The moon is falling : URL ibm $ gfg $ eur com$ tms"". This one has ""moon is falling"" which sounds like a joke in Chinese, but I'm not sure if it's meant to be taken literally or just as an expression of despair. The company symbols mentioned are IBM and possibly others listed. Without clear context, this tweet might not have a strong enough sentiment.

Then there's ""The moon is falling : URL gfg $ eur com$ tms"". Similar structure here, but the companies seem to be GFS and EURN exchange rates? Again, no clear sentiment or factors to assess.

Lastly: ""The moon is falling : URL tms $. com $ com $ com"". Same pattern here. Just two words for different companies, with the same joke about the moon falling. Not providing any meaningful info.

Putting it all together, each tweet seems to be using a specific phrase (""moon is falling"") and pointing out that some companies are affected by immigrants or specific factors. But without context on whether these companies are up or down, I can't determine if they're positive or negative. The overall sentiment isn't clear because the tweet doesn't specify how it affects any particular stock.

So, considering all tweets, none provide a clear indication of a company's performance impact, just general statements about the moon falling and some companies being affected by immigrants."
2014-09-01,Positive,"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine the likely impact on the stock price of a given company based on the provided tweets. The user has already outlined a structured approach, so I'll follow that closely.

First, I have to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the tweets provided, most are about stocks like AMZN (Amazon), BABA (BetaBar), and others. Each tweet seems to be making announcements or updates related to these companies. For example, some mention ""unleashing the hounds . alibaba frenzy month to begin"" which could relate to Amazon's earnings report.

Next, I need to break down each tweet into positive and negative factors. Positive tweets might highlight growth opportunities, new products, favorable news, etc., while negative ones might point out challenges, setbacks, or upcoming issues.

However, some tweets seem repetitive or lack clear directions. For instance, tweets 1-4 all mention AMZN closing the market but don't specify if it's positive or negative regarding the stock. Similarly, tweets 6-9 and others repeat similar statements about the market closure affecting stock performance. This repetition might indicate mixed sentiment because multiple tweets are pointing in different directions.

Tweets that focus on specific announcements, like ""unleashing the hounds . alibaba frenzy month to begin"" could be positive because they're encouraging Amazon's efforts. Conversely, tweets like those discussing the e-commerce market heating up suggest a positive outlook for companies involved.

The overall sentiment is determined by combining all these factors. Even though some tweets are repetitive, if there's an imbalance in positive and negative directions, it can lead to a mixed overall sentiment. In this case, since multiple tweets point towards Amazon doing well (like the e-commerce market heating up), but others might be less clear or contradictory.

I also need to consider whether all factors are about the same company. The user has provided multiple tweets about AMZN and other companies like BABA, TwTR, FB, GOOG, etc. Without knowing which stock is being analyzed, it's challenging to decide the overall impact on a single stock. However, given that some tweets discuss Amazon specifically in the context of its performance, I can infer that for each tweet, there might be multiple angles to consider.

Considering all this, even though the majority are positive, especially regarding Amazon and e-commerce, without clear-cut information about a specific stock's performance or upcoming events, it's tricky. But overall, since many tweets suggest improved markets or positive news, maybe leaning towards a [Positive] sentiment. However, I'm not entirely certain because some tweets could be ambiguous."
2014-09-02,Negative,"Alright, I'm looking at this query where someone wants me to analyze some tweets and determine their impact on a company's stock price by giving it a [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative] tag. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the task is asking for an analysis of specific tweets related to a given stock. The user provided 10 tweets, each labeled with certain keywords and hashtags. My job is to extract the target stock symbol from these tweets because that's crucial for assessing sentiment towards it. However, looking through the tweets, I don't see any mentions of any particular stock. It seems like all the tweets are about various tech companies and general market sentiments.

So, without knowing which company's stock these tweets are referring to, I can't determine the impact on its stock price. Each tweet is either mentioning a company or discussing global markets. Since the target stock isn't specified, it's impossible to assess the sentiment towards that specific company based solely on this information.

I also need to consider whether I'm supposed to infer which company these tweets are about. For example, if one of the hashtags like ' spy' or ' baba' is from a known company, maybe I can think about their current stock performance. But since the user hasn't provided any context for those hashtags, it's safer to assume that each tweet is unrelated and doesn't affect the specific stock in question.

The output requirement clearly states that I must conclude with one of three tags: Positive, Neutral, or Negative. Since none of the tweets provide information about a specific stock, my analysis can't be made. The user might have intended for these tweets to pertain to a particular company, but without that info, I'm stuck.

I should respond by acknowledging the lack of clarity and state that it's impossible to determine sentiment based on the given data. Maybe suggest they check if I can provide more context or if there's additional information about the stock symbol needed."
2014-09-03,Neutral,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. The user mentioned ""Amazon"" a few times, which is clear. So, the target is AMZN.

Next, I have to parse each tweet one by one. 

Looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER amazon cfo to step down next summer amid investor discontent URL $ amzn"". This seems like a comment from an employee talking about stepping down and why they're concerned about investor sentiment. So, this is a negative factor because it's pointing out concerns among investors.

The second tweet starts with ""rt AT_USER biggest u . s . tech companies founded by 1st / 2nd gen immigrants : 1 $ aapl 2 $ goog ..."". This looks like a summary of the performance of various tech companies. It mentions multiple stocks, which are all big tech companies, but I don't have specific information on their valuation or future outlook.

The third tweet is identical to the second one, repeating that same content. So, it's just reinforcing the same data about tech companies without adding any new points.

The fourth tweet is also identical and repeats the same info as before.

Then there are two more tweets:

6. ""alibaba stock is expected to begin trading on the new york stock exchange in less than a fortnight URL $ baba $ amzn $ yhoo""

7. ""$ am zn - amazon announces kdp kids and launches kindle kids ’ book creator URL""

Each of these seems like positive statements about Amazon, especially around their products or announcements. 

Now, for each tweet, I need to separate the factors into positive and negative.

Starting with tweet 1: Negative factor (investor concern about cfo stepping down). No obvious positive points here.

Then, tweets 2-4 are all neutral because they just summarize the performance of tech companies without providing any investment recommendations or analysis. So these don't add anything to the sentiment for Amazon directly.

Tweets 5 and 6 mention that Amazon is set to start trading on NASDAQ in less than a fortnight, which seems positive about their trading presence. Also, the price targets are mentioned: $200 target for BABA and $10 target for AMZN. These could indicate investor interest or expectations.

Tweet 7 talks about Amazon launching a new line of kids' books. While this is positive, it's more about consumer goods and not directly related to their tech stock performance.

So, putting this together: The negative tweet (tweet 1) has the highest impact because it involves a company employee with an immediate concern about investor sentiment. The two positive tweets (tweets 5 and 6) add value by predicting trading presence and setting price targets, which are positive signals for investors. Tweets 2-4 don't contribute much beyond summarizing.

Overall, there's a mix of negative and positive factors. However, the most impactful tweet is the one about Amazon's trading presence, which suggests they'll be in the market sooner than expected. The negative tweet adds some context but isn't strong enough to outweigh the positives from 5 and 6. I'm leaning towards a neutral overall sentiment because there are both positive and negative factors influencing the stock."
2014-09-04,Positive,"Alright, let's see what I need to do here. So, the task is to analyze a set of tweets related to the stock price of a company and determine if they are positive, neutral, or negative. The output should be one of those three tags: [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative].

First, I need to look at each tweet provided. The user has given six tweets about Amazon's stock. Let me go through them one by one.

Starting with the first tweet: ""AT_USER here is why URL you are trailing your $ qqq $ amzn a4123 takethisbet."" Hmm, this seems like some random text that includes URLs and symbols. It doesn't seem relevant to the stock price or any news about Amazon. I don't think this tweet has anything to do with the stock market, so it's probably neutral.

Next is ""watch for $ amzn to break down again if it breaks 346.10 area."" This tweet is talking about a specific area where Amazon's stock might break down. It seems like it's providing information that could affect the stock price. However, without knowing whether the stock is going up or down in that area, it's hard to say if this is positive or negative. It's more of a warning or a hint at potential changes, so maybe neutral.

The third tweet: ""$ amzn - tech stocks : apple , amazon spur tech sector gains URL."" This seems relevant because it mentions Amazon as part of the tech sector. It also uses the word ""URL,"" which might be a typo or a placeholder for content related to tech stocks. It's providing information about the tech sector, specifically mentioning two companies whose tech sectors are gaining. This indicates that there is an expectation that Amazon might be doing well in this sector, so I think this is positive.

Fourth tweet: ""$ amzn shares inamazon just moved higher by + $ 10."" Here, it says Amazon shares have moved higher by a specific amount. That's a direct statement about the stock price movement. It shows that there has been an increase, which could indicate a positive sentiment for investors. So this should be positive.

Fifth tweet: ""$ amzn earningz crater gap almost filled now . only in this market ..."" This one is talking about the earnings per share (EPS) ratio, also known as the profit margin or crater gap. It mentions that the earnings ratio has almost filled the gap and it's in this specific market. A situation where a company's EPS is almost filling its EPS ratio could indicate good performance because higher EPS generally means stronger profitability. So this is positive.

Sixth tweet: ""rt AT_USER honestly though market does feel like there's a big ol rug pull coming . be careful on those longs that $ amzn was siiiiiick."" This one has some contractions and mentions the term ""rug pull,"" which could be metaphorical for increased demand or interest. It also warns about potential problems with holding onto shares when the market might feel like it's rising too much, which is a common sentiment. This indicates that there's a cautious approach to holding shares, which can sometimes be considered neutral because it reflects concern but doesn't necessarily predict a specific direction.

Now, let me summarize each tweet's impact on sentiment:

1. Neutral: The tweet has no relevant content for the stock.
2. Neutral: It's providing information about potential changes in Amazon's stock.
3. Positive: Mentions tech sector gains and is part of a broader tech discussion.
4. Positive: Directly states an increase in stock price.
5. Positive: Indicates that earnings are on track, which can be seen as positive for investors.
6. Neutral: Warnings about market movement and cautionary advice.

So combining all these, I have five positive tweets and one neutral tweet. That means the overall sentiment is positive because there's a majority of positive comments outweighing any negative ones. Even though some are slightly neutral, they still lean towards positive. So, the conclusion should be [Positive]."
2014-09-05,Neutral,"Alright, let me figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. The target stock symbol is Amazon, so I need to look for mentions like ""AMZN"" or relevant terms related to the company.

Looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER this $ amzn relative p / e chart is hilarious . URL"". It seems like someone is talking about something funny around Amazon's P/E ratio. The term ""P/E chart"" directly relates to financials, so that probably means positive news about the company's performance. High P/E ratios usually mean investors expect higher stock prices in the future because they're more risk-averse, but this tweet suggests some light-hearted commentary rather than serious info.

Then there's another tweet: ""rt user is just saying hello! $ amzn relative 100%$. I love that!"". This seems more skeptical. The mention of a 100% relative return sounds very positive and enthusiastic, which could indicate investor confidence or genuine excitement about the stock. It might come from someone who genuinely believes in Amazon's potential.

Both tweets seem to provide some information relevant to Amazon without being too technical. The first is probably just a joke about their financials, while the second is expressing hope for a significant return. However, I need to consider if these tweets could have a broader impact beyond what's directly stated.

I should also think about whether the user of this tweet has any hidden biases or intentions. Are they trying to sell on social media? Or are they just sharing positive vibes without explicitly targeting Amazon? Without more context, it's hard to say, but the key here is that the tweets might be providing some light-hearted content related to the company, which could be seen as unrelated.

Considering all this, the first tweet offers a somewhat relevant financial metric in a humorous way, while the second suggests genuine excitement. Together, they might not collectively convey strong positive or negative information about Amazon's future stock price. It's possible that their impact is limited or negligible compared to more direct information."
2014-09-06,Positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out whether these tweets are positive, negative, or neutral in terms of their impact on a stock's future price. Let me break down each tweet and analyze them step by step.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""$ amzn low date = sept -05-2014 open = 346.3 high = 346.83 low = 342.5 close = 346.38 volume = 2111200 URL"". Hmm, this seems like it's providing market data for Amazon (AMZN) on a specific date. It mentions the open, high, low, close, and volume, which are standard financial indicators. The volume is 2,111,200. That's quite a high number, indicating significant trading activity. 

Now, from my knowledge of AMZN stock, when a large volume of shares trades, especially in the early morning or late afternoon, it can sometimes signal strong earnings reports. Amazon has been involved with revenue growth, so maybe this could indicate positive news about their performance.

But wait, I should also consider if there's any negative information here. The date is sept 5th, 2014, which was in a volatile trading week for AMZN. They had a significant earnings call that year, and they might have been cautious with stock price adjustments due to market conditions. But the volume here is so high that it might not be just a minor correction.

So combining these factors: high volume suggests strong news, possibly related to earnings, which could contribute positively to the stock. Therefore, this tweet seems like it's contributing to a positive sentiment towards AMZN."
2014-09-07,Missing,File not found
2014-09-08,Neutral,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on stock prices for Amazon. So, I need to go through each tweet one by one.

First tweet: ""google vs . amazon : the drone wars $ amzn $ goog URL via AT_USER"". Hmm, this seems like a comparison between Google and Amazon, mentioning drones and URLs. It's more about market comparisons rather than specific stocks or anything financial related. So that might not directly impact Amazon's stock price.

Second tweet: ""amazon cuts the price of its fire phone to 99 cents after lackluster sales . prime membership still included $ amzn url"". This sounds like Amazon is cutting prices on their products and mentioning that despite having poor sales, they're including prime memberships. This could be a positive sign because lower pricing might make Amazon more competitive with others or attract more customers. But I'm not sure if it's enough to swing the stock positively.

Third tweet: ""rt AT_USER just in : amazon cuts price of fire phone to 99 cents with 2 - year contract . • $ amzn"". This seems similar to the second one but uses RT (replies). It's again about Amazon lowering prices and including prime memberships. Again, this is a price cut which might be positive because it shows they're trying to be more competitive or affordable.

Now, considering all these tweets: The first one is about market comparison, not specific stocks. The next two are about Amazon reducing prices, which could indicate good financial performance relative to sales and being more approachable with their products. 

I'm leaning towards a positive sentiment because the price cuts might suggest improved profitability or better competition. But I'm not entirely sure if it's enough to make the stock jump."
2014-09-09,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. The user provided six tweets and wants an overall conclusion using ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"". 

First, I'll go through each tweet one by one.

1. "" $ amzn news alert : URL updated options view : URL all options views : URL"" – Hmm, this looks like a generic update about Amazon's stock. It mentions different URL formats and maybe updates on the company, so it seems like information that could influence investor sentiment. But without specific details, it's hard to tell if it's positive or negative.

2. "" $ amzn - amazon to offer fire phone for 99 cents URL"" – This tweet is offering a discount for an Amazon Fire phone at $99 cents. That seems profitable and competitive, which suggests good news. The positive context here might indicate buyers are looking to buy something valuable.

3. "" $ spy scalp calls , $ aapl calls , $ twtr calls all working beautifully , $ amzn still playing catch up."" – This tweet mentions that all three companies (spy,AAPL, TWTR) have profitable scalping calls and that Amazon is still catching up. This sounds positive because it's providing information about the stock performance of competitors and comparing them to Amazon. Positive factors could push investor sentiment upward.

4. "" AT_USER i shorted yday at 341 & just covered . might buy some puts . i think money will exit $ amzn for $ baba . profit margins 46 %"" – This seems like a trade action where the user is selling Amazon stock and expecting it to move up against another stock, BABA. The mention of profit margins at 46% suggests that the shorting strategy might be profitable. If there's interest in moving funds from one stock to another, it could affect Amazon's share price positively.

5. "" don't trade $ amzn ! earn 100 % per year with our ' top 10 hedge fund ' artificial intelligence - URL $ spy $ qqq"" – This tweet is encouraging the user to avoid trading Amazon and suggests a strategy involving a top hedge fund using AI. If there's positive attention from hedge funds, it could indicate that others are looking at Amazon stock, which might be seen as a positive signal. But I'm not sure if this directly impacts Amazon's share price.

6. "" mercenary links : if it ’ s nae scottish , it ’ s crap URL $ fb $ amzn $ hd $ ge $ gs $ dri"" – This tweet seems to mention potential negative outcomes, specifically if the UK'sScottish government action leads to something negative (probably referring to a political event). However, this is unrelated to Amazon's stock and more about a political news story. It doesn't directly relate to the company's performance or future prospects.

Now, combining these factors: The first tweet provides general information which could influence sentiment. But the second tweet is specific to Amazon offering a product at a discount, suggesting strong market interest. The third tweet points out that competitors are doing well, which could be positive for Amazon. However, the fourth tweet talks about shorting and expecting price movements, which could add positive momentum but depends on the strategy's profitability. The fifth tweet suggests avoiding trading to earn high returns, which might not have a direct impact. The sixth is irrelevant political news.

Overall, the tweets are providing various signals that might influence investor sentiment positively. Amazon's product discount, competitive performance of competitors, and potential trading strategies could all be positive cues for the stock price. However, it's possible the user or market has other factors in mind, but based on the information given, I'm leaning towards a positive impact."
2014-09-10,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me start by looking at each tweet one by one.

The first tweet lists several stocks with symbols like ddd, sune, bnny, etc., but it doesn't specify which one is being analyzed or what the company is. So I'm not sure if this is about a specific stock that's in the market. Maybe it's more about discussing trading strategies or stock performance? Without knowing the exact stock, it's hard to assess the impact.

The second tweet mentions $ eod p / e ratio and several companies like ibm, ko, amzn, ssft, but again, this seems too vague. It doesn't specify which stock is being referenced. There's no context or details that would make me confident about which company this refers to. Without more information, I can't determine the sentiment impact on a specific stock.

Since both tweets are too broad and lack specifics about the stock symbol, it's impossible for me to accurately assess their impact on the stock price. Therefore, without additional context, it's not possible to conclude whether they're positive, neutral, or negative."
2014-09-11,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about Amazon's stock price and determine their impact on the future stock price.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. It looks like ""amzn"" is repeated multiple times, so that must be Amazon. Cool, so we're looking at Amazon's performance relative to that symbol.

Next, for each tweet, I should separate them into Positive and Negative factors. Let's go through each one:

1. The first tweet says, ""rt AT_USER $ amzn bounce off 327.50 starting to pick up ."" Hmm, it mentions a price increase of $327.50. That seems positive because it's showing growth or improvement. So this is a Positive factor.

2. The second tweet is: ""rt AT_USER $ amzn has no profits , and why this ... works URL via AT_USER $ $ $ URL"" I'm not sure about the exact meaning, but if there's no mention of profit, that could be negative because it suggests the company isn't profitable. So that would be a Negative factor.

3. The third tweet is: ""AT_USER way to go ! here is why URL you are leading your $ amzn $ exc 7c51b takethisbet"" It looks like there's a typo with exclamation points and mentions something about leading and excitement, which might imply growth or success. So this could be Positive.

4. The fourth tweet says: ""rt AT_USER interesting nasdaq green and all of these names red $ lnkd $ nflx $ amzn $ yelp $ twtr"" This seems to mention a variety of companies (like NASDAQ, LNDK, NFLX, YELP, TWTR). It's vague and not specific to Amazon. Without clear information about profits or negative news related to AMZN, it's hard to tell the sentiment. So this tweet might be Neutral because we don't have enough context.

Now, for each tweet, I need to assess their overall impact on Amazon's stock price. 

Looking at tweet 1: It shows an increase in price, which is positive. That would probably push Amazon higher, making it Positive.

Tweet 2 mentions no profits, so that seems like a negative signal. If the company isn't profitable, its stock might go down, contributing to a Negative impact.

Tweet 3 talks about excitement and leading, which could suggest growth or expansion in other areas, but it doesn't directly address Amazon's profitability. So this might be considered Neutral as we don't have enough information.

Tweet 4 is too vague, mentioning several unrelated companies. Without specific info on Amazon's performance or any negative indicators, it's hard to assess the sentiment. Therefore, this tweet contributes a Neutral perspective.

Now, considering all four tweets, there are mixed signals: some positive, some negative, and one neutral. But since tweet 1 shows an increase in price without much context, maybe that's strong enough to consider Positive. However, tweet 2 is more directly negative about profits. 

But the question asks for a single conclusion. If I look at all four tweets together, the overall sentiment could be mixed because some are positive and one is neutral. But it's also influenced by tweet 1 which shows an increase, which might tip it in that direction.

I'm leaning towards [Positive] because tweet 1 clearly shows the stock has bounced up, but tweet 2 contradicts with no profits. However, without more context from other tweets like tweet 3 and 4, I can't be entirely sure. But since tweet 1 is a clear indicator of an increase, it's a strong positive point.

So overall, after considering all factors and the most impactful tweet, I think the stock may have an upward trend due to the price increase in tweet 1."
2014-09-12,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze the given tweets to determine their likely impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by identifying the target stock symbol from the tweets. 

Looking at each tweet:

1. "" $ amzn yield click here : URL also see : $ pbr $ efoi $ bdsi $ hpnn ~"" – This doesn't directly give a stock symbol, so maybe it's related to other financial metrics or just a link.

2. "" 1 week until new asics running shoes from zappos . ( thus delaying dell laptop ) . $ amzn URL"" – The relevant stock here is $ amzn, Amazon Inc.

3. "" link didn't work . one more try . 9/11 / 14 video recap $ aa $ spy $ lulu $ dis $ aapl $ pcln $ amzn $ wfm URL"" – This tweet mentions several stocks like spy and wfm related to the market, not directly mentioning Amazon.

4. "" rt AT_USER rumor : google inc to buy 40 % stake in ebay inc at $ 68 / share $ aapl $ amzn $ ebay URL via AT_USER"" – Again, the target stock is $ amzn, Google Inc., which is Alphabet Inc.

5. "" lessons from amazon's sale on its fire phone . $ amzn . URL"" – The relevant stock here is $ amzn again, Amazon Inc.

So, the key stocks influencing this analysis are AmZN and potentially others mentioned like WFM, spy, PCLN. 

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one to assess positive or negative factors affecting Amazon's stock price.

1. This tweet is a link request which doesn't provide clear information about amzn's performance.

2. Talks about delays in the delivery of Dell laptops due to new running shoes from Asics and mentions other stocks, but no direct info on amzn.

3. Refutes a previous statement, says the video recap didn’t work again, and mentions various stocks, so not directly related to amzn.

4. Discusses a rumor about Google buying 40% of eBay at $68 per share. I know that Google is a major player in e-commerce, with significant revenue and stock price growth. However, it's speculative whether this transaction would positively or negatively impact Amazon. It could create competition but also may reduce Amazon's market share.

5. Talks about lessons from Amazon's fire phone sale, which was a negative event. This might have influenced Amazon's perspective on product launches or sales strategies, potentially affecting their investor sentiment towards amzn.

Now, combining these factors: The tweet mentions that Google is buying eBay stock, which could be seen as competition but also indicates a focus on e-commerce and perhaps the market's reaction to Amazon's recent loss. Additionally, it references lessons from Amazon's fire phone sale, suggesting they were cautious about upcoming sales.

Looking at sentiment analysis:

- Positive factors: Mentioning amzn URL and possibly others (like pbr, bdsi, hpnn) which are positive metrics.
- Negative factors: The rumor about Google buying eBay could be seen as a negative event affecting Amazon's view on the market or their business strategies.

But I don't have specific information to determine whether this transaction is positive or negative. However, the context suggests that amzn might be seeking other investments and not necessarily increasing their market share with such a purchase.

So overall, the positive factors are present, but the negative factors like Google's move could have an impact. Since I don't have clear evidence of which factor outweighs the other, it's tricky, but leaning towards mixed sentiment."
2014-09-13,Positive,"Okay, so I'm looking at these tweets and trying to figure out how they'll impact the stock price for Amazon. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the tweet says ""amzn ebay to start in-app mobile advertising network in q4 - analyst blog URL."" So, Amazon is developing something in their iOS app's mobile advertising features in the fourth quarter. This suggests that Amazon might be expanding into this area.

Now, I'm supposed to analyze each tweet for factors and sentiment. But wait, there are no other tweets here, so it's just one. Hmm, maybe I need to look beyond just the one tweet? Or is that all there is?

I should recall the solving process: first identify the target stock, then separate positive and negative factors, assess sentiment per tweet, and combine them for an overall sentiment.

Since there's only one tweet, maybe it's focusing on the direction of their expansion. That might indicate some confidence or optimism about future growth potential in that sector. But without more context from other tweets or analysis, I can't be certain.

Looking at the output requirement, I need to conclude with a single tag: Positive, Neutral, or Negative. Without knowing how the one tweet affects the overall market, it's hard to determine if it's positive or negative. It could be neutral if Amazon doesn't move much in that direction.

Wait, but maybe the expansion is for a new product line or feature, which can sometimes lead to higher stock prices. However, without more info from other tweets or data points, I can only assume that this tweet suggests a potential positive outlook based on their strategic move, but it's also possible that any such development might not have a massive impact yet.

So considering all the factors and sentiment analysis, there might be some positive implications for Amazon's stock price. But since we don't have complete data from other tweets or information about broader market conditions, I'll go with [Positive]."
2014-09-14,Missing,File not found
2014-09-15,Negative,"Okay, I need to determine the impact on the stock price of a company based on the provided tweets. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock from the tweets. It seems like ""amzn"" is mentioned in multiple tweets with stock quotes and discussions about strategic initiatives. So the stock symbol is likely Amazon.

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate positive (P) and negative (N) factors. Let's go through them one by one.

1. The first tweet says: ""rt AT_USER take a quick breather today and try and match these ceos to their respective company URL $ yhoo $ amzn $ …"". This doesn't mention anything relevant about Amazon, so it's probably neutral or maybe negative if taking a break might affect investor sentiment.

2. The second tweet is from Lagarde sca, who mentions the Hachette team citing AMZN's executives as ""ciblent"" and their URLs are $ amzn. While this involves company announcements, it doesn't provide much detail on Amazon's stock performance or factors affecting it.

3. The third tweet says: ""$ amzn stock quote , 12:47 pm : 322.31 -8.88 ( -2.68 % ) . This is a standard stock quote update. It shows that the stock price is dropping by about 2.68% by 12:47 PM. Negative percentages indicate loss or decline.

4. The fourth tweet mentions $ amzn office depot's strategic initiatives leading to a 52-week high and an analyst blog post. While it talks about strategic initiatives, it's unclear how this affects Amazon. Strategic initiatives could be positive if they improve the company, but without more context, it's hard to assess.

5. The fifth tweet is similar to the third one: ""$ amzn stock quote , 10:47 am : 322.99 -8.20 ( -2.48 % ) . Another standard quote update showing a decline of about 2.48%.

6. The sixth tweet says: ""ponzi finally feeling some pain . and the volume isn't that high yet . $ amzn"". This seems like a negative outlook, suggesting that ponzi is in financial trouble, which could be a red flag for Amazon's stock performance.

Now, let's assess each factor:

- Tweet 1: Neutral/Neutral
- Tweet 2: Maybe Negative (though not enough detail)
- Tweet 3: Negative (Price decline)
- Tweet 4: Unclear but possibly Positive or Negative depending on context
- Tweet 5: Negative (Same as Tweet 3)
- Tweet 6: Very Negative, suggesting ponzi is struggling.

Combining all factors, there's a mix of positive and negative. Tweets 3 and 5 show price drops, while Tweet 6 indicates a significant issue with ponzi. However, without context on how these relate to Amazon's performance, it's challenging to weigh the overall impact.

Given that several tweets are negative regarding stock prices or analyst reports, and there's a very negative note in one tweet about ponzi struggling, I think the sentiment is overall Negative."
2014-09-16,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets regarding their impact on Amazon's stock price. I'll start by going through each tweet one by one.

First tweet: ""$ brnw ran up 145 % so far today ! huge news : URL $ amzn $ mcox $ goog"". This seems like a positive sign for Amazon since it mentions a significant increase and lists the stock symbols on the web. High percentage gains usually indicate good news, which is a good indicator of positive sentiment towards the company.

Second tweet: ""AT_USER i think bezos is a genius . right up there with the greats . but $ amzn shareholders are so loyal and need a roi-focused approach"". This tweet mentions Bezos as a genius and talks about Amex's loyalty. I know that Bezos was involved in several tech startups, including Amazon. The mention of loyalty suggests customer satisfaction, which is a positive sign. However, it also says ""need a ROI-focused approach,"" which could imply that they might be looking to improve their return on investment strategies. ROI (return on investment) focuses on profitability and efficiency. If Amex shareholders are loyal but need better ROI strategy, this could mean the company needs to optimize its operations or products to increase profitability, which would have a positive impact.

So, breaking it down: The first tweet is definitely positive because of the significant news about Amazon's performance. The second tweet adds some positive sentiment by highlighting Bezos' contributions and the importance of being loyal but suggests a strategic improvement for better ROI. Both tweets indicate that Amex is doing well and possibly looking to enhance their business operations."
2014-09-17,Negative,"Alright, let's try to figure out the stock sentiment based on the provided tweets about Apple Inc. (Aapl). 

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. The tweets are numbered 1 through 9, and looking at them, it seems like all of them mention ""aapl,"" which is the ticker symbol for Apple.

Now, moving on to analyzing each tweet one by one. I'll separate the factors as positive or negative based on what's mentioned in each tweet. Then, I'll assess the sentiment towards investor interest or market impact.

Starting with tweet 1: It talks about all gains today being in negative territory and mentions several companies like lnkd, pcln, bidu, goog, fb, twtr, tsla, amzn, etc. This seems like a mix of positive and some negative points, but since it's focused on selling actions at a specific time, I think this is more about individual investors rather than overall market sentiment.

Tweet 2 is about Google & Amazon reacting to Fedex's logistics business URL. It mentions that their interests are being tracked via AT_USER for both companies. This could be related to media attention or stock price movements but doesn't indicate a clear positive or negative stance yet.

 Tweet 3 focuses on a trigger sell action at a specific time for Apple, with the tweet mentioning sigma-x, crossfinder, lts, and p/t ratios. Similar to tweet 1, this seems more about selling calls rather than general sentiment.

Tweet 4 is between Apple and URL, discussing differing attitudes toward something. This might imply that one is more supportive or cautious, but without specifics on whether it's positive or negative, I'm unsure how to categorize it yet.

Tweet 5 mentions a shipping rate hike by Fdx, which could impact competition for Apple. If there are volume increases due to such events, this might indicate some concern about increased competition, potentially affecting stock price.

Tweet 6 talks about Fdx hiking shipping rates and how it would make Apple's drone products tough to compete with Amazon. This seems like a direct impact on revenue or market share, which could signal positive sentiment as the company faces increased competition.

Tweet 7 is about solid news from Aapl with sell actions triggered by AT_USER. It sounds more proactive than neutral but not explicitly positive or negative yet.

Tweet 8 mentions that amzn's daily volume grew in the first quarter due to e-commerce growth, driven by tech companies. This could be a positive indicator of increased demand for Amazon, possibly aiding sales or stock price gains.

Tweet 9 is about Aapl selling calls at a specific time with a positive p/t ratio. This seems like an action taken by sellers rather than just general sentiment.

Putting all this together: There are some individual selling calls triggered by news events, which might indicate cautious behavior but not necessarily overall positive or negative. However, the mention of increased competition in tweet 6 and volume growth in tweet 8 could suggest that the stock is being impacted by market conditions, possibly leading to a positive sentiment as companies adjust their strategies.

But wait, I'm only considering individual tweets here; it's possible that some tweets are more about reactions than direct impact. If each tweet has mixed reactions, maybe they're contributing neutrally. But tweet 6 shows increased competition which could suggest that the stock is being affected negatively in a way that might lead people to think of negative sentiment.

Alternatively, considering all the selling calls and volume growth, it's possible that there's a shift towards lower prices due to increased competition, which is a sign of positive news. So, maybe the overall sentiment leans toward [Positive] because there are shifts in investor behavior towards selling stock despite some individual actions."
2014-09-18,Neutral,"Alright, let me figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. 

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at tweet 2, it mentions ""Amazon Refreshes its Kindle Line."" So the target is Amazon.

Now, breaking down each tweet:

Tweet 1: It says, ""AT_USER you think we could see $ amzn prices eventually ? ... the market cap is huge"" – this seems like a positive statement because it's talking about looking for future price trends and mentioning high market caps. Positive sentiment here.

 Tweet 2: ""Amazon Refreshes its Kindle Line."" This is a positive sign as it highlights Amazon's expansion into new products, which can boost sales. So another positive tweet.

Tweet 3 mentions several companies with $, like ABL, V, AMZN, etc., but the exact target isn't clear yet. It sounds enthusiastic about potential future growth areas. Positive factors here.

Tweet 4 is about an AlphaFold's IPO. The mention of a large market cap (""168 billion"") by another tweet seems to indicate Amazon could be part of the bigger tech sector and thus have more valuation. This could influence stock sentiment positively.

Tweet 5 also mentions AlphaFold but places it under BABA, which isn't relevant for AMZN. The price value suggests a higher valuation, so positive sentiment.

Putting all these together: Each tweet is expressing optimism about future growth, market potential, or company performance. While not every tweet might be entirely positive (like tweet 5 being under a different company), the overall trend seems positive. However, it's not certain if there are any negative factors missing here."
2014-09-19,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on stock price.

First tweet is from ""rt AT_USER commented on : 'alibaba : are the risks worth the rewards ?'"" The user is talking about Alibaba and wondering if the risks are worth the rewards. I know that Alibaba is a big tech company, but I'm not sure if they're taking on risks that could be bad for them. Maybe it's about their business decisions or future strategies.

Second tweet says: ""rt AT_USER thinking of getting a new e-reader ? a look at amazon's newest kindles and tablets : URL $ amzn."" The user is considering purchasing an Amazon e-reader, which ties back to Tesla (TSLA), another tech company. It seems like the sentiment here might be mixed because if people are looking ahead, it could indicate optimism about tech stocks.

I don't recognize these companies by their symbols, so I'm not sure if they're positive or negative. For BABA, without knowing much about their risks versus rewards, it's hard to say. For AMZN, the e-reader tweet might suggest a focus on Amazon's products and maybe some optimism about tech stocks overall.

Since both tweets are looking towards future investments in tech companies, I'm leaning towards a neutral or positive sentiment because they're all about potential growth and investment in sectors like tech that can fluctuate. But without more context, it's hard to be certain."
2014-09-20,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how the given tweet affects the stock price. The tweet says, ""看到同事们都在聊 baba bidu goog amzn apl nashville..."" So, it mentions several companies: BABA is buyback dividend, GOOG is Google, APL is Apple, and NASHville. These are all tech stocks.

First, I need to determine if these companies align with the target stock symbol. The user mentioned ""baba,"" which is a buyback dividend stock for Repeat Trading, but it's also part of the broader tech sector. The other words like Google (GOOG), Apple (APL), and NASHville – that seems out of context. Maybe the tweet mentions other companies unrelated to the target.

Next, analyzing factors: There are positive factors like buyback dividends and potential growth from Alphabet Inc. and Amazon. However, the negative factors mentioned don't align with a tech stock. So, maybe the tweet is mentioning other companies outside the tech sector.

Assessing sentiment: The user is looking at coworkers discussing multiple stocks but doesn't express any specific sentiment towards the target company or its performance. It's more about unrelated information being spread around.

Overall, without knowing if the tweet affects the target stock directly and how it influences investor sentiment on that stock, I can't conclude much. The mention of other companies might not impact the future stock price of the target. So, considering all factors, the impact seems neutral because there's no direct connection to the target stock.

I think the answer should be [Neutral] since the tweet is about unrelated stocks and doesn't indicate any specific sentiment on the target company."
2014-09-21,Missing,File not found
2014-09-22,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. I'm not an expert, but I'll do my best.

First, looking at the target stock symbol from the tweets. The first tweet mentions kids' books and movies, so I think that's Amazon. Yeah, they have a lot of kids' literature and streaming services like Amazon Prime. So ""AMZN"" is the company we're looking at.

Now, for each tweet, I need to separate positive (P) and negative (N) factors. Let me go through them one by one.

1. The first tweet talks about AMZN offering curated books and apps. That sounds good because more curated content can attract more customers, which should positively impact the stock price. But it also mentions if this doesn't sell or if Kindle never will, so that seems like a negative factor because if their product isn't as popular, investors might worry.

2. The second tweet mentions spending money on the biggest e-commerce sites each second: AMZN is doing $9k, BABA is at 9k, and EBIY is 2k. It's all about how much they're spending to reach more people. More spending can drive sales or increase visibility, which is positive. However, it doesn't mention any specific negative actions like price increases or product decreases.

3. The third tweet repeats the same numbers as the second one, so it's just repeating the same information. It still points towards higher spending and thus a positive impact on sales, but again, no specifics about negative factors here.

4. The fourth tweet talks about Alibaba holding $678 million for AMZN, EBAY at 20k, and BABA at 9k. This is more about the company's value and financials. It shows growth in earnings which should boost the stock price positively.

5. The fifth tweet suggests avoiding NFLX unless shorting it. That sounds like a negative action because avoiding something that could be a profit-taking strategy might reduce demand for AMZN, causing investors to worry. So this is definitely a negative factor here.

6. The sixth tweet repeats the same numbers as tweet number two again. It's just more emphasis on spending on e-commerce sites, which I've already considered earlier. No new information or specific negatives here.

Now, let me summarize:

- Positive factors: More curated books, higher spending on e-commerce sites (from tweets 1,2,3), growth in earnings from Alibaba and EBAY.
- Negative factors: If the product doesn't sell (tweet 1), avoiding NFLX (tweet 5).

I should combine these. The positive factors are more about increased sales and diversification into different platforms, which can be good signs. However, the negative factor is a potential short selling strategy that could hurt AMZN's stock price.

So overall, I think there's some good news but also a small risk. It might lead to mixed sentiment, leaning slightly positive because of the diversified approach and growth in earnings, but with a possible downside from shorting NFLX."

2014-09-29,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on Amazon's stock price. So, first off, I see that there are only two tweets provided.

Looking at the first tweet: ""$ amzn sortation centers combined with w / AT_USER increasingly likely to compete directly with $ fdx AT_USER URL."" Hmm, ""sortation centers"" – wait, isn't that a typo? It should probably be ""sorted""? That's a term related to sorting algorithms in computer science. I'm not sure if this is relevant at all. The mention of AT_USER seems odd and possibly irrelevant because it doesn't seem like an action related to Amazon or stock price changes.

The second tweet just repeats the same sentence again: ""$ amzn sortation centers combined with w / AT_USER increasingly likely to compete directly with $ fdx AT_USER URL."" It looks like a copy-paste error from the first one. Again, without any meaningful information on how this affects Amazon's stock, it's hard to tell if there's any positive or negative intent here.

Since both tweets are essentially repeating the same incorrect and nonsensical statement about the AT_USER variable, they probably don't provide any actionable insights into either the company or the market. There's no mention of positive factors like earnings reports, product launches, regulatory changes, etc., nor is there a clear indication of negative risks such as economic downturns or competitive issues.

Considering that, I can't see any underlying sentiment in these tweets. They just have incorrect or irrelevant language without any connection to Amazon's stock performance. Therefore, it's best to categorize this as [Neutral] because the information provided doesn't offer a clear direction for assessing how these tweets will impact the stock price."
2014-09-30,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether these tweets are positive, negative, or neutral about Amazon's stock price. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually.

The first tweet says "" $ amzn news alert : URL updated options view : URL all options views : URL"" and then mentions ""URL"" again. Hmm, that doesn't seem to be a clear message regarding Amazon. It seems like it might be about updating the URL for options viewing or something else related to stock alerts. But without knowing more about what those URLs are for, I can't really assess their impact on Amazon's stock price. 

The second tweet is ""$ amzn weekly view at this tl support . URL daily view URL looks like good long w / stop 320.50"". This one seems more specific. It mentions that the weekly view supports a long position with a stop at 320.50. I'm not sure what ""long"" means in stock terms, but if it's about buying Amazon stock and setting a stop-loss price, that could be a positive action for investors. They might be looking to limit potential losses before the stock goes higher.

Putting these together, while the first tweet is vague but possibly related to some technical or user-related update, the second one suggests that Amazon's management is positioning itself as ""long"" and has set a stop-loss price at 320.50. That sounds positive because it's showing confidence in the stock moving up from there.

But since the first tweet doesn't provide enough information about what it's related to, I can only make an educated guess based on the second tweet. It hints at strategic positioning which is a common positive signal for investors."
2014-10-01,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually and break them down.

First tweet: ""amazon and disney back together $ amzn url"". Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. It mentions making it back together with Disney but includes some URLs which probably aren't relevant here. Maybe the idea is to discuss Amazon's stock. But I'm not sure if combining companies in this way would impact Amazon's performance negatively or positively.

Second tweet: ""rt AT_USER which states make you pay an amazon sales tax : url $ amzn url"". This one mentions a user's instruction about taxes on Amazon purchases. It seems like the user is advising them to avoid Amazon by telling them how much tax they'd pay, implying that paying more for Amazon could hurt their profit. So this tweet is targeting Amazon and might be seen as negative because it affects their revenue.

Third tweet: ""moving to alaska byefelicia ' AT_USER which states make you pay an amazon sales tax : url $ amzn url"". Similar structure here, talking about taxes on Amazon purchases. It's probably a tip for users not paying the sales tax, which could lead them to overpay and thus lower their net profit. Again, this is negative because it impacts Amazon's revenue.

Putting it all together: The first tweet doesn't seem to directly impact Amazon. The second and third are about Amazon's taxes. Since they're advising users on how much tax they might have to pay, that could lead to lower profits for Amazon. But wait, the user mentions making them avoid Amazon by telling how much you'd pay. So is this a suggestion to stay away from Amazon or maybe just about their financial advice?

I'm not entirely sure if these tweets are indicating a long-term impact or just a short-term tip. But considering they're talking about taxes and profits, it leans more towards negative because they could lead users to overpay, affecting Amazon's performance negatively.

Wait, but the user is advising them to avoid Amazon by telling you how much tax, so that might actually encourage customers not to buy from Amazon, which could affect Amazon's revenue. So overall sentiment would be negative."
2014-10-02,Neutral,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether these tweets will impact the stock price of Amazon. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol from the tweets: ""69 % of americans pay sales tax on amazon."" Hmm, that's interesting because the tweet mentions Amazon, not the company itself. Maybe they're highlighting their sales tax policies? Or perhaps it's a typo or irrelevant information.

Now, for each tweet, I need to identify positive and negative factors. But wait, this is just one tweet, so how do I assess sentiment? It doesn't mention any actions or opinions about Amazon. The content here seems neutral because it's just talking about sales tax rates without any mention of stocks, profits, or anything related to the company.

So, since there's only one tweet and it's not providing any information that would sway investor sentiment towards positive or negative, I don't have enough data to determine a clear overall sentiment. It could be seen as neutral because it doesn't reflect actual market trends or company performance.

Therefore, considering this single tweet is insufficient for determining the stock price impact."
2014-10-03,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how the given tweets affect the stock price of Amazon. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the target stock is Amazon, and they provided a tweet where someone is talking about flu and cold symptoms, along with pertussis (which is an odd term for chickenpox). They're referring to Steve Grasso's EBBA pick and making some predictions about Amazon's stock price. Specifically, they mention that people won't want to go outside and will shop online.

So, the tweet seems positive because it's encouraging investor sentiment—people are talking about staying at home or shopping online as a precautionary measure during an epidemic. They're using EBBA, which I think is Amazon's ETF for their business equity, so that part might be reinforcing investor confidence in Amazon's stock performance.

The factors here include flu symptoms, cold symptoms, and pertussis (which is another term for chickenpox). These seem like general health-related advice. While there's no specific mention of negative information or predictions about the company itself, this positive language about staying home makes me think it's boosting investor confidence.

I should also consider the overall context: during an epidemic, many investors are seeking ways to protect their homes and reduce travel costs. Encouraging people to shop online instead of in person is a practical step, which can create buzz and boost stock prices. It shows that there's a strategic move for Amazon to support their customers by aligning with their employees' needs.

Negative factors aren't being mentioned here, but the positive outlook suggests no negative signals are present. The language used doesn't indicate any negative news about Amazon itself or its operations.

Putting it all together, the tweet is positive because it's promoting a proactive approach from people to protect themselves and customers, which generally leads to higher stock prices when there's optimism about the company's support."
2014-10-04,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. So, I'm given a problem where I need to analyze tweet sentiment towards a stock's impact on its future price. The user has provided specific tweets and an output requirement.

First, I'll take a look at the input: one tweet about Amazon (AMZN). It says that 69% of Americans pay sales tax on Amazon and mentions which states they are, citing URLs for authorization. 

Now, according to the solving process, I need to identify the target stock, which is AMZN. Then, analyze each tweet by separating positive and negative factors. In this case, the tweet doesn't mention any specific company besides mentioning it in a general context about sales tax rates. It's more of an opinion or data point rather than directly affecting Amazon.

Next, I need to assess sentiment for each tweet. Since there are no direct statements about positive or negative factors related to the stock, this tweet isn't providing enough information. It's more about market conditions and states paying taxes. 

Putting it together, without any explicit information on factors affecting Amazon's performance, including this tweet might not give a clear indication of the company's future impact. The lack of specific data means I can't make a strong conclusion.

So, considering that, the sentiment summary would be neutral because there's no sufficient positive or negative evidence to influence the stock price."
2014-10-05,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of a company. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet: ""$ ctix chart click here : URL also see : $ tck / b.to $ amzn $ corn $ fitx ~"". Hmm, that's a bit unclear. The symbols like ""ctix"" don't seem familiar unless they are company abbreviations. Maybe it's Amazon (AMZN) andFitx? Wait, there's also ""b.to"" which might be ""best to,"" but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's something else entirely. Let me think—common symbols could be Apple, Microsoft, Google, or others.

Wait, the user provided a line that says ""$ tck / b.to $ amzn $ corn $ fitx"". If ""b.to"" is ""best to,"" then maybe ""corn"" and ""fitx"" are other stocks. But without more context, it's hard to pin down. Maybe I should make an assumption here.

Assuming the stock symbol is Amazon (AMZN), that would be a big clue because AMZN has been around for quite some time and is well-known. Let me proceed with that in mind.

Now, looking at each tweet:

1. ""$ ctix chart click here : URL also see : $ tck / b.to $ amzn $ corn $ fitx ~""

This tweet is a bit confusing. It seems to be linking a ""ctix"" symbol to something and mentions AMZN (Amazon), corn, and Fitx. Without more context, it's hard to assess the factors here. But perhaps ""ctix"" is a typo or maybe a company name. Alternatively, maybe it's ""chips to go,"" which is a trend in tech stocks.

2. ""$ tck / b.to $ amzn $ corn $ fitx ~""

This one has multiple symbols: TCK, BTO, AMZN, Corn, and Fitx. Again, without knowing what these stand for, it's tough. ""Bto"" could be ""best to,"" but I'm not sure. If this is about Amazon being a good investment or stock performance, that would be positive.

Given the ambiguity in the first tweet, maybe I should focus on tweets where the symbols are clearly known stocks like AMZN andFitx (since Fitx is less common). So, perhaps ignoring the first tweet for now.

Assuming we're analyzing ""tck / b.to / amzn / corn / fitx,"" let's break them down:

- ""tck"": Not sure what this stands for. Maybe ""time to click"" or something else.
- ""b.to"": Again, unclear. Could be ""best to watch.""
- ""amzn"": Amazon
- ""corn"": Corn is a food stock, but more commonly known as cornmeal and corn crops.
- ""fitx"": Fitbit, the health app company.

So, if I think about this, it's possible that some of these are positive. For example, ""tck / b.to"" could be indicating a trend or upcoming event related to Amazon or corn. But without context, it's speculative.

Given all this uncertainty, perhaps the overall sentiment is leaning towards Neutral. Because while there might be some positive factors likeFitx and maybe a suggestion about Amazon's performance, the information isn't clear enough for a strong conclusion."
2014-10-06,Positive,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I need to extract the target stock from the tweets. Looking at tweet 1, it mentions ""xmas"" and includes companies like ebay, amzn, tcx, and meet. The symbols there are $ebay, $amzn, $tcx, and $meet. But the user didn't specify which specific company, so maybe I can infer from the context or perhaps it's for a general analysis? Wait, the output needs to be about a given company, but in the provided tweets, the only stock mentioned is ""internet catalog stocks,"" looking back at the list: [this time of the year gear up early on your xmas ⛄ ️ stocks $ ebay $ $ amzn $ tcx $ meet $ dlia internet catalog stocks 💎]. Oh, so 'dliac' here. So the target stock seems to be ""internet catalog stocks"" or perhaps another company if the symbol is different.

Next step: tweet-by-tweet analysis. Each tweet has factors and sentiment. Let's look at each one:

1. ""this time of the year gear up early on your xmas ⛄ ️ stocks $ ebay $ $ amzn $ tcx $ meet $ dlia internet catalog stocks 💎""

I think this is a general sentiment about stock prices around Xmas, mentioning specific companies but not clearly identifying which one.

2. Assuming it's another tweet from the same person or context? Wait, the output seems to be for a specific stock, so maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me check again. The user provided only one set of tweets with both positive and negative factors: ""xmas stocks"", but in the first tweet, they mention multiple companies. So perhaps each tweet is about different companies.

Wait, let's see:

- ""this time of the year gear up early on your xmas ⛄ ️ stocks $ ebay $ $ amzn $ tcx $ meet $ dlia internet catalog stocks 💎""

This one mentions several companies: ebay, amazon, tcx, meet, and dlac. But without knowing which one is the target, it's hard to assess.

- The other tweet seems incomplete or possibly a typo, perhaps missing a company symbol. Maybe it's ""this time of the year gear up early on your xmas ⛄ ️ stocks $tcx $dliac""

Assuming each positive and negative factor applies to different companies, but without knowing which one is being referred to by ' internet catalog', I can't make an accurate assessment.

Wait, maybe all the tweets are from the same source. Let me check again:

The user provided two tweets:

1. ""this time of the year gear up early on your xmas ⛄ ️ stocks $ ebay $ $ amzn $ tcx $ meet $ dlia internet catalog stocks 💎""

2. Maybe ""this time of the year gear up early on your xmas ⛄ ️ stocks $tcx $dliac""

So two tweets mentioning multiple companies each, but without knowing which one is the target.

Wait, the output must be for a specific company, so perhaps the target is "" internet catalog"", as in the second tweet. But the first tweet includes both 'ebay' and 'tcx'.

Alternatively, maybe all tweets are about a single stock? Or perhaps the user wants to analyze multiple stocks based on these tweets.

Wait, given that the output is ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"", I think each of these tweets contributes to the analysis for one target stock. But since both tweets include multiple companies, it's unclear which specific stock we're looking at.

This could be a problem because without knowing which company is being referred to in the tweets, I can't accurately assess their impact on its stock price. The sentiment from each tweet might affect different stocks but unless we know which one, we can't tell the overall trend.

Perhaps the user intended for these tweets to reference a single stock, maybe ' internet catalog', and all the positive or negative factors apply to that specific company across both tweets.

Assuming that, the first tweet has ""ebay"", ""amzn"", ""tcx"", ""meet"", and ""dlac"" as companies. The second tweet mentions only ""tcx"" and ""dliac"". If we take ' internet catalog' as the target stock, then perhaps each positive or negative factor from both tweets affects that company.

But without knowing which factors are positive or negative for each company, it's hard to tell how they impact the stock. It's possible that some factors could be positive and others negative towards a particular stock across multiple tweets.

Wait, maybe the user wants me to infer based on patterns. If all positive factors in one tweet apply to all companies, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The initial analysis seems unclear because it refers to multiple stocks without identifying which is the target.

Alternatively, perhaps each tweet is about a specific company, like 'ebay' or 'tcx'. Let me try that:

First tweet: ""this time of the year gear up early on your xmas ⛄ ️ stocks $ ebay $ $ amzn $ tcx $ meet $ dlia internet catalog stocks 💎""

Assuming this refers to 'ebay', 'amzn', 'tcx', etc. But again, without knowing which stock is being referred to as the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake and only provided one tweet with multiple companies mentioned, but then in the output line they want a single stock symbol.

Wait, looking back at the initial problem statement, the user says: ""Please do this for a given company"" followed by [Positive], etc. Then the tweets are about other stocks. So perhaps each tweet is about different companies for that specific target company?

But without knowing which company it's referring to, it's impossible to determine.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since the user provided two tweets with multiple factors and a single output line, perhaps each positive or negative factor applies only to that specific stock, so the overall sentiment is aggregated from all applicable factors across both tweets for the target company.

But without knowing which company it's about, I can't make an accurate determination.

Wait, maybe the first tweet includes 'ebay', and then the second one mentions 'tcx'. So perhaps if the target stock is 'ebay' or 'tcx', each positive factor in each tweet would affect their respective companies.

But since both 'ebay' and 'tcx' are mentioned multiple times across tweets, it's unclear how they're affecting the overall stock price for the specific company.

Given this uncertainty, perhaps I need to make an educated guess. If all the factors from both tweets point towards positive sentiment, maybe the stock is expected to rise.

Alternatively, if some factors are negative and others positive, but with more positives than negatives, it might be a [Positive] overall.

But without knowing which company we're talking about or how each factor affects that specific stock, it's impossible to give an accurate conclusion. Perhaps I need to assume all the positive factors point towards a favorable outcome for the target stock."
2014-10-07,Positive,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how these tweets impact the stock price of Amazon (AMZN). Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. The main one is AMZN, which seems clear in all the tweets. Now, looking at each tweet individually:

1. ""eu opens formal probe into amazon's tax practice URL $ amzn"" - This mentions a legal probe, but it doesn't say anything positive or negative about the stock price.

2. ""URL emylers : xtremepicks alerts : $ amzn up to date company activities and other URL"" - Again, this tweet seems to be alerting about the company's activities without any direct information on AMZN performance.

3. ""URL $ 188 loss in $ amzn loss ova here"" - Here, it looks like Amazon lost $188, but I'm not sure if that's a positive or negative impact on their stock price. Losses are usually negative indicators unless they're part of a larger trend.

4. ""get our top penny stock picks , for free ! huge upcoming picks : URL $ orcl $ yhoo $ amzn"" - This seems like a call to action with money, which could suggest confidence in the stock's value or future performance.

5. ""eu watchdog targets amazon's luxembourg tax deals URL $ amzn"" - Similar to tweet 1 and 3, this mentions something about taxes but again without specific information on AMZN's performance.

Now, I'll analyze each tweet for positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. 

For tweet 1, the focus is on a legal probe, which might show concern but doesn't provide specific info on stock movement.

Tweet 2 alerts about company activities and other URLs, so no direct data here.

Tweet 3 mentions a loss in dollars, which could be a cause for negative sentiment if the company's performance has declined.

Tweet 4 suggests getting penny stocks, which is positive because it indicates investors are interested or confident.

Tweet 5 talks about taxes but again without specifics on AMZN's performance.

Considering all these tweets, some mention losses and others talk about upcoming picks. However, there's a tweet (tweet 4) that directly offers money, which often signals positive sentiment towards the stock price. The other tweets are either cautionary or neutral in nature. 

So overall, I think it leans more towards a Positive sentiment because tweet 4 is offering a direct deal and might lead to increased investor interest."
2014-10-08,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided a tweet and some empty tweets, but I can see they're asking about analyzing it for stock market impact. Hmm, wait, actually, the first tweet is incomplete—it ends abruptly with ""URL $ amzn $ fb $ twtr."" So maybe that's just part of the data.

Looking back at the query, it seems like there are multiple tweets provided, but some lines are empty except for the first one. The user wants me to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on a company's stock price using ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"".

Okay, so my task is to process each tweet step by step. First, I need to extract the target stock from the tweets. But in this case, the first tweet has several $ signs and numbers that are mixed together. Let me take a closer look: ""volume tells you everything URL $ amzn $ fb $ twtr."" It seems like it's asking about volume affecting everything related to Amazon, Facebook, or Twitter.

Now, for each relevant tweet, I have to separate positive and negative factors. But the user hasn't provided many tweets beyond that first one. Hmm, maybe they've meant to provide all the tweets? Let me check again.

Wait, the output requirement says that only one line should be given, concluding with [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. So perhaps I need to make a decision based on the information at hand. The tweet is talking about volume affecting various industries, including Amazon, Facebook, and Twitter. It doesn't mention any positive or negative factors for the stock price.

Maybe this tweet is trying to inform potential investors about the importance of volume trading across different platforms. But without specific data points or news related to a particular company's performance, it's hard to determine if it's positive or negative.

Given that, I think the overall sentiment is neutral because there's no explicit information on whether the stock will go up or down based on this tweet alone. It's just talking about the broader context of volume and industry associations, which might influence investor decisions but don't directly impact the stock price."
2014-10-09,Missing,File not found
2014-10-10,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First tweet is a question about safely yelling 'fire' in a crowded store. It seems like it's asking for information or advice, which might indicate that someone isn't sure if this could affect Amazon's operations or safety, so maybe they're cautious.

The second tweet talks about Amazon welcoming their holiday season with a brick & mortar store. That suggests they have expanded into physical retail, which is positive news because expansion can attract more customers and increase sales.

Third tweet mentions a TA on Twitter triggering a buy order for a certain stock, specifically at $260.00. This could be about sentiment from the market reacting to this event, possibly due to fear or excitement around the company's performance.

Fourth tweet describes a bear call spread ending outside the money with a net profit of $320. This is a trading strategy where selling calls and buying puts can lead to profits if stock prices fall. A positive outcome here might indicate confidence in Amazon's stock, but it could also be due to speculation rather than actual performance.

Putting it all together, the company has expansion plans (second tweet) which is good for growth. The TA event (third tweet) adds speculative sentiment. The bear call spread (fourth tweet) showing profit could imply confidence or success in their trading strategy, though it's not a direct financial outcome. However, the positive news about expanding into physical stores and seeing profits might lead to an overall positive outlook."
2014-10-11,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by breaking down each tweet.

First tweet: ""danrocks : $ dig getting interesting $ t $ cew $ amzn $ aci URL"" – Hmm, the terms 'dig' and 'caw' don't make much sense in this context. The rest of it seems like a random collection of symbols, so maybe it's irrelevant or a typo. I'll note that but probably ignore it for now since it doesn't provide meaningful information.

Second tweet: ""$ amzn daily short volume over the last 10 days . URL"" – This mentions the daily short volume for Amazon over the past 10 days. Short volume can indicate investor sentiment, especially if there's a lot of buying or selling happening. I'm not sure about the current trend, but it could be contributing to market interest.

Third tweet: ""rt AT_USER can you legally yell ' fire ' in a crowded $ amzn store ?"" – The user is asking about the legal aspect of yelling 'fire' in a crowded store setting. This seems like a casual question that might not have much impact on stock price because it's more about behavior regulation rather than market trends or company performance.

Looking at the factors and sentiment, I don't see any positive or negative indicators from these tweets related to Amazon's business operations, profits, or other key metrics. The third tweet seems off-topic but could be a distraction. 

Putting it all together, none of the tweets provide concrete information that would tip the scale towards positive, neutral, or negative sentiment for Amazon. They either have irrelevant content or speculative questions."
2014-10-12,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether these tweets will affect the stock price of a company, and if so, how. The user provided two tweets and wants me to analyze them into [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Let's break this down step by step.

First, let's identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet: ""AT_USER you're welcome .. AT_USER would be here now if $ amzn drones were airborne ! hope you have a chance to read my book too."" Hmm, that doesn't specify the stock symbol. Maybe it's Amazon? Because ""amzn"" is a common abbreviation for Amazon. Let me check the second tweet: ""here are my gains and losses from last week : URL i traded $ twtr $ nflx $ gpro $ amzn $ tsla stocks options daytrading."" So, again, AMZN is in there.

Now, I need to analyze each tweet. The first one seems like a motivational comment, probably for someone who's happy with Amazon and hopes they can read my book if drones are out of the way. It doesn't mention anything about stock performance or positive or negative feelings towards the stock.

The second tweet is more detailed. It mentions trading several stocks: Twilio, NFLX (which I think is another acronym for Twilio), GPRO, AMZN, and TSLA (tesla). The quotes talk about gains and losses from last week and talking about options trading. The word ""options"" might indicate investor sentiment towards the stock, possibly a positive or neutral note.

Looking at the factors: Positive could be the mention of trading stocks and potential gains; negative might be the use of words like ""trades,"" which can sometimes convey emotions. But since it's talking about options trading, that's usually seen as speculative trading, which is generally viewed negatively in terms of long-term stock performance.

Sentiment-wise, I think this tweet is trying to highlight the volatility and the potential risks involved in short selling options on stocks like AMZN. So, it seems negative because it's not giving a positive outlook but rather pointing out possible risks.

Putting it together: The first tweet doesn't have any specific information about stock performance or sentiment towards AMZN. The second tweet is more of an analysis that leans towards potential gains and some negative sentiment from options trading practices. Combining these, the overall impact on the stock price seems negative because investors are being advised about the risks associated with short selling.

So, I'll conclude the overall sentiment as Negative."
2014-10-13,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets regarding Amazon's stock price impact.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. The first two tweets mention ""amzn,"" which is clearly Amazon. So both tweets are about Amazon.

Now, looking at each tweet one by one:

1. "" $ amzn would like to see a bounce off 308 URL"" – This seems to be promoting an upcoming earnings report or financial update where Amazon aims to reach a certain revenue number, specifically 308 dollars. Bounce-off earnings can indicate positive news about future performance.

2. "" rt AT_USER can you legally yell ' fire ' in a crowded $ amzn store ?"" – This tweet is asking if someone can legally yell 'fire' in a crowded store setting. It's more about user behavior and legal aspects, which might affect customer engagement or brand perception. Legal concerns could have negative implications for the company.

3. Similar to the second tweet: "" rt AT_USER can you legally yell ' fire ' in a crowded $ amzn store ?"" – Again, same question but possibly with different context. It's about user behavior and legal compliance, which adds another layer of negative sentiment.

4. "" URL pt set at $ 300.00 by wolfe research $ amzn URL"" – This seems to be announcing a price target for Amazon's stock. Price targets can influence investor sentiment as they indicate expectations about the company's future performance.

Now, assessing each tweet's factors:

1. Positive: The promotion of an earnings report could boost stock prices.
2. Negative: The legal question affects user behavior and might lead to negative sentiment or decreased engagement.
3. Similar to 2; possibly leaning towards negative due to legal concerns and potential customer frustration.
4. Positive: A price target sets expectations for the future, which can be positive for investors.

Combining these factors:

- The first tweet is likely a good sign with an upward outlook.
- The second and third tweets present serious legal issues that could reduce investor confidence.
- The fourth tweet gives concrete information about expectations, which supports a positive impact on stock price.

However, the negative tweets (2 and 3) might have more weight due to their potential to directly affect user behavior. But since they're separate tweets, each adds a piece of the puzzle.

Overall sentiment is a mix of some positive factors promoting future earnings and several negative factors impacting user experience or legal compliance. Given that price targets can be seen as an important indicator for stock movements, the overall sentiment leans towards positive because it addresses investor expectations about the company's performance."
2014-10-14,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price based on the given information.

First, looking at tweet 1 and 2, both mention the upcoming calendar year, which might affect earnings or financials. They also have a $280 target, suggesting potential growth expectations. This could be positive if it indicates confidence in future performance.

Tweets 3-4 repeat the same question about legal yelling 'fire' in crowded stores. Since courts are often strict and such a move could lead to fines or legal repercussions, these tweets are likely negative because they could impact Amazon's reputation or financial stability.

 Tweets 5 and 6 talk about GDP news with specific stocks listed but no direct info on AMZN. However, the mention of $ gdp doesn't directly relate to AMZN, so this might be neutral or slight positive if it reflects broader economic conditions that could affect the company.

Tweets 7-9 are another set about Tesla and other companies. They don't provide specific information about AMZN's performance, but they're speculative in a broad market context, which makes them somewhat neutral.

Lastly, tweet 10 provides the current price of AMZN's put options. While this is crucial for investors, it doesn't express sentiment towards or against AMZN itself.

Considering all these factors—the calendar year (positive), mention of $280 target (neutral to positive), legal yelling issues (negative), economic data (neutral), and stock option prices (important but not sentiment-driven)—the overall sentiment seems mixed. There are both positive indicators like the $280 target and speculative information, but the legal aspect points towards some negative sentiment.

I think it's leaning more towards [Neutral] because while there are some positive points, the legal tweet is a significant factor that could lead to negative reactions."
2014-10-15,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about $ AMZN (Amazon). First, I need to understand what each tweet is saying and assess their impact on the stock price.

Starting with the first tweet: ""who needs lending club when you can have alibaba financing along with all they own - URL $ baba $ amzn $ lclub"". It seems like it's discussing how Lending Club can be used alongside Alibaba financing. I'm not sure what exactly these terms mean, but maybe it's a way to expand their financing options or services for Amazon.

The second tweet: ""given $ nflx has 36m in u . s . this chart would imply $ amzn at 21m video subs seems high ? rt AT_USER URL"". This looks like an announcement about NFLX (which is Amazon's stock) having $36 million in U.S. currency. The user thinks that this could mean Amazon's value might be $21 million, which seems high. I'm not entirely sure what they're referring to here—maybe market sentiment or a typo?

The third tweet: ""on day it launches video stream svc walmart sounding like amazon . $ amzn rt AT_USER ecommerce spend going up 200-500 m next year $ wmt"". It mentions launching a video streaming service (SVC) for Walmart, which is part of Amazon. The user thinks the Amazon stock price might increase by $200 to $500 million in the next year and wants to know more about it.

The fourth tweet: ""$ amzn - connect group shares soar after amazon delivery tie-up URL"". It looks like a follow-up or response to a previous tweet, discussing a connection between Amazon's shares and their deliveries tied to Amazon. The user is expecting a confirmation from Amazon.

Now, summarizing each tweet:

1. First tweet is about Lending Club and Alibaba financing—maybe not a big factor for AMZN.
2. Second tweet mentions NFLX having $36m U.S. currency, but the user thinks it might mean Amazon could be $21m. This seems like speculative information without context, so possibly neutral or positive? Not sure.
3. Third tweet talks about an upcoming video streaming service launch and expects AMZN to rise in price. This sounds promising for a stock move.
4. Fourth tweet is a follow-up to the third one.

Looking at the factors:

- Positive: The third tweet seems like it could drive up the stock, suggesting Amazon's services are good. The fourth response would likely confirm this, which is positive.
- Negative: Not many negative tweets here.
- Neutral: Maybe if one or more of these posts causes concern about AMZN's fundamentals, but overall not leaning towards negative.

Combining all factors, especially the third tweet, it looks like there's an optimistic outlook. So the overall sentiment should be positive."
2014-10-16,Negative,"Alright, I need to figure out how to analyze the given tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of AmZN. Let me start by understanding each tweet step by step.

First, looking at tweet 1: ""rt $ qqq algos broke 91.70 level , p / t 90.00 $ msft $ pcln $ goog $ fb $ twtr $ tsla $ amzn $acln"" Hmm, this seems like it's talking about a price event for AmZN. The word ""algos broke"" might indicate something related to stock prices or tech-related factors. Since it mentions specific levels crossed, it could be a signal about the stock's behavior.

Next, tweet 2: ""rt AT_USER can you legally yell ' fire ' in a crowded $ amzn store ?"" This one is more about language use and legal aspects, not related to AmZN's performance. It seems like a joke or a casual question, so probably not affecting the stock price negatively.

Tweet 3 is an image URL: ""$ amzn news : "" dealing with twin gluts of market correction $ amzn $ brk . a …"" It doesn't say much about stock performance but talks about the company's situation. Maybe it's a placeholder for more info, so less likely to impact the stock.

Tweet 4 mentions that Amazon is creating jobs at its fulfillment and sorting station, specifically mentioning 80,000 seasonal jobs in the U.S. That sounds positive because it shows job growth, which can boost company performance and investor confidence.

Tweet 5 talks about hiring holiday hands for a black Thursday event but also says more about AmZN's stock price. The mention of black Thursday could be significant if the stock is expected to drop that day due to events or market corrections.

Tweet 6 is another language question, similar to tweet 2, so it doesn't add much information related to AmZN's performance.

Now, combining these: tweet 1 mentions a specific price level and may indicate AmZN's behavior. tweets 4 and 5 suggest job growth and potential stock movements. However, tweet 3 is unclear, and 6 is just a question. The overall sentiment seems positive because of the job creation and possible market reactions from those tweets.

But wait, tweet 1 could be related to the price action; if it's mentioned that algos broke a level, maybe indicating a correction or upward trend, which would make the stock less negative. However, without explicit information on price changes, I can't say for sure. But overall, considering positive elements and possible corrections, but not too strong.

I think it leans towards [Positive], as there are signs of positive developments."
2014-10-17,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about Amazon's stock. So, first I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at tweet 1, the URL is ""amazon will launch its grocery delivery business in brooklyn , new york on friday"". That sounds like Amazon is launching their grocery delivery service somewhere in New York. Similarly, tweet 2 says "" amazon fresh for new york city kicks off today"", so again, they're kicking off a grocery delivery campaign there.

For the other tweets, I'm not as sure. Tweet 3 mentions $ aapl and $ amzn getting how you will trade the upcoming earning, which doesn't give me much info about the stock. Tweet 4 is ""rt AT_USER amazon's same-day grocery delivery makes east coast debut"", so that's another launch announcement in Eastern Time. But tweet 5 is just mentioning $ amzn 307.4 and seems like a price update.

Now, I need to parse each tweet for positive or negative factors. Let's take them one by one:

1. Tweet 1: They're launching grocery delivery services in New York. That sounds good because it could attract more customers and potentially increase sales.
2. Tweet 2: The campaign is kicking off in NYC. Again, that's good news for the company as it might gain credibility and drive traffic.
3. Tweets 3, 4, and 5 don't provide much information about the stock, just price updates or trading instructions. So maybe they're not providing positive or negative info on the stock itself.

Now, assessing sentiment: all the tweets are either announcing launches or updates that could be seen as supportive for Amazon's stock. No major negatives mentioned here. There aren't any conflicting or controversial information. So overall, I think this is a positive signal for the company."
2014-10-18,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by extracting the target stock symbol from each tweet.

First tweet: It mentions $119.52 profit and a few minutes later, back to $2.00. That sounds like positive news because it's showing an increase in value. So that's definitely positive for Amazon.

Second tweet: ""url verified"" probably refers to the website being confirmed or verified. There's also mentions of ""amzn man,"" which seems like a typo and might be referring to Amazon. The part about profit again, but this time with ""a few minutes later."" Again, another positive sign of increased profits.

Third tweet: ""owell glad i was able to hol..."" It says ""hold on"" maybe, so the sentiment is positive here too. It's indicating a good outcome or something favorable for Amazon.

Fourth tweet: ""what's up man?"" It seems like it's a way to ask someone (probably a co-worker) about the situation. That's just casual language and doesn't indicate any positive or negative information. So this might be neutral because it's not providing any valuable news beyond the greeting.

Putting it all together, the first three tweets are positive with increased profits, while the fourth is neutral. The overall sentiment seems to be a combination of positive and neutral, but since most are positive, I'll consider the stock price to be [Positive]."
2014-10-19,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by analyzing each tweet separately.

First tweet is ""rt AT_USER can you legally yell ' fire ' in a crowded amzn store ?"". The user is asking about the legality of someone yelling 'fire' in an AMZN store. That seems like a sensitive question, possibly related to workplace safety or personal behavior. I'm not sure how this affects Amazon's stock directly.

Second tweet says ""rt AT_USER here's a list of the 50 largest companies set to report earnings next week : URL $ aapl $ ibm $ amzn $ yh …"". The user is sharing information about upcoming earnings reports for three companies: Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon. This could impact their stock prices because investors might expect positive news from these companies.

However, the first tweet isn't clear on how it affects Amazon's stock. It's more of a hypothetical question than any actual information that could influence the market. The sentiment is unclear since it doesn't directly relate to financial performance or other indicators like EPS or revenue.

Overall, the tweets are not strongly positive, negative, or neutral in their impact on Amazon's stock price."
2014-10-20,Positive,"Okay, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of Amazon. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet is about an upcoming shot next for a stock. It mentions something with 'shot' which might not be relevant to Amazon's earnings or stock performance.
2. The second tweet again talks about an upcoming event and has the same keyword, so it doesn't provide useful info on Amazon.
3. This tweet says stocks with implied volatility above IV index mean dish 50 dollars. I'm not sure what 'dish' means here; maybe it's a typo or irrelevant information about Amazon stock price.
4. The fourth tweet asks if you can legally yell 'fire' in a crowded store, which is unrelated to Amazon's earnings.
5. The fifth tweet suggests picking another stock after a penny stock rally, mentioning AmZN and MCOG. This doesn't directly impact Amazon's performance or stock price.
6. The sixth and seventh tweets are about Amazon's earnings for Q3 2014. These could indicate positive news that might affect the stock price.

The most relevant tweet is the sixth one, which mentions Amazon reporting earnings for Q3 2014. This suggests that there was some positive information impacting Amazon's performance, leading me to conclude it's [Positive]."
2014-10-21,Negative,"Okay, let me try to figure out the impact of these tweets on AmZN's stock price. So, first, I need to analyze each tweet one by one.

Looking at tweet 1, it mentions several companies like AT_USER and others with their earnings. It doesn't mention anything about Amzn or any specific stocks they might be related to. So, probably no direct impact from this tweet.

Next, tweet 2 talks about $ URL inc., specifically mentioning Amazon's service looks like AMZN. It says the service looks like AMZN, which is a bit confusing because I think it's referring back to Amzn. Maybe that means something different or maybe it's a typo? I'm not sure if this has any specific implications on Amzn's stock.

Tweet 3 is about holders of $ AMZN needing protection if they have earnings coming in legally. That sounds like advice for investors, so perhaps this tweet is trying to push people into taking more risks by ensuring they protect themselves financially. If people are encouraged to put more money into protective measures, that might increase investor sentiment.

Tweet 4 is about a listener's watchlist with AMZN stock. It mentions legally yelling 'fire' in a crowded store setting. Again, this is talking about specific actions and their legal implications. It could be related to safety concerns or just common sense advice for viewers, which might influence how they view Amzn.

Tweet 5 talks about an audience watching certain stocks like Aapl, Btu, etc., and has a URL pointing to AMZN's tweet history. This is more about content consumption than stock performance. It doesn't directly mention anything related to the company or its stock price.

Finally, tweet 6 discusses $ MARA filing cases in their portfolio with specific credit figures. While this is an internal company matter, it doesn't provide any information about Amzn's stock price. So, no direct impact here either.

So, putting it all together, the main points from tweets 3 and 4 seem to be pushing people towards taking more precautions by protecting their investments in Amzn when earnings are expected. This could lead to increased demand for AMZN stock as investors might feel safer or more cautious, which would likely be a positive impact on their price."
2014-10-22,Neutral,"Okay, I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by understanding each tweet and what they're saying.

The user has given five tweets that seem to be predicting or discussing the potential of Amazon's stock performance based on other companies' actions. So, my task is to assess if these predictions are positive, neutral, or negative for Amazon.

First, let's look at each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet says, ""rt AT_USER the numbers amazon needs to hit in earnings report for the stock to soar URL $ amzn down 20 % ytd URL."" This seems like a warning or concern about Amazon's earnings because it mentions a decline of 20% year-to-date (YTD). If the company isn't improving, it could hurt their stock. So this is probably negative.

2. The second tweet is ""rt AT_USER here's why amazon's jeff bezos is the highest-performing ceo alive URL $ amzn."" Jeff Bezos is a well-known figure in tech and has been involved in Amazon before. If someone is highlighting his performance, it could indicate positive sentiment about him or Amazon. So this might be positive.

3. The third tweet starts with ""rt AT_USER it ’ s time to buy netflix stock – here ’ s why $ nflx $ amzn $ twx : URL via AT_USER."" It's talking about buying Netfix because of Netflix's performance. If Netfix is doing well, that could positively influence Amazon's stock. So this would be positive.

4. The fourth tweet repeats the same: ""it’s time to buy netflix stock – here’s why $ nflx $ amzn $ twx : URL via AT_USER."" Same analysis as tweet 3, so another positive sentiment.

5. The fifth tweet says, ""rt AT_USER $ amzn reports 10/23 but i think the $ fdx holiday outlook this morning already tells the story that matters."" It mentions a report and talks about the holiday season's expectations. Holiday season can be confusing as people might make stock moves based on expectation rather than real data. This could be neutral because the actual performance is uncertain.

Now, to summarize:

- Tweets 1: Negative (Earnings decline)
- Tweets 2: Positive (Jeff Bezos, a big name in tech)
- Tweets 3 and 4: Positive (Netflix performance affecting Amazon)
- Tweet 5: Neutral (Holiday season uncertainty)

Overall, the positive tweets are 2, 3, and 4. The negative is tweet 1. There's a mix of positive and neutral.

I think it's more balanced than all being positive or negative. But since the main positive trends are from 2, 3, and 4, maybe overall sentiment leans towards positive but with some negative points."
2014-10-23,Missing,File not found
2014-10-24,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price and decide whether they're positive, neutral, or negative. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

First tweet: ""took profit nov 300 puts $ amzn ... + 325 %"". It says AMZN is +325%, which sounds like a strong increase, but I'm not sure if that's enough to make it positive in the stock market context. Positive percentage changes are common, but I need to look at other factors too.

Second tweet: ""rt AT_USER friday's fearful outlook as ebola hits nyc : $ spy $ dia $ amzn $ tsla $ tm amazon - - URL URL"". The user is talking about EBola (Emerging Market Board) hitting the virus and making investors think Amazon might be affected. Negative outlook could reduce investor confidence, but there are other companies mentioned like SPY and TSLA as well. It seems like a mix of negative and positive factors.

Third tweet: ""URL sell rating reiterated at s & p equity research . URL $ amzn amzn"". The user is reiterating their selling position on AMZN. That might be seen as negative because it's reducing the stock price, but I'm not sure how significant that impact is compared to other factors.

Fourth tweet is a repetition of tweet 2: ""rt AT_USER friday's fearful outlook as ebola hits nyc : $ spy $ dia $ amzn $ tsla $ tm amazon - - URL URL"". Same content as the second tweet, so it's likely repeating negative sentiment from EBola hitting the market and affecting Amazon.

Fifth tweet: ""how much more can $ amzn move ? see what top traders as saying URL AT_USER"". The user is asking about AMZN's potential movement. There are mentions of top traders, which suggests that the stock is being analyzed or discussed in terms of trading sentiment. But it doesn't explicitly state a positive or negative impact; it just invites discussion.

Sixth tweet: ""playing some equity today ... 2000 shares short $ amzn lets see where this goes"". The user mentions 2000 shares shorting AMZN, which is speculative trading and often done by winners. It could indicate optimism about the stock's potential in the market but might not reflect the overall impact on the company's performance.

Seventh tweet: ""amazon fire phone flops "" show of hands : surprised ? $ amzn $ aapl $ goog $ msft URL"". This seems like AMZN is being compared to other companies. The user says it's a ""show of hands"" which might indicate surprise or concern about the company's performance. It could be seen as negative if there are concerns, but it's not explicitly stated as positive.

Eighth tweet: ""AT_USER $ amzn not done dumping . careful out there . will be seeing 200sma on daily 262 in your future . who's going be the bag holder ?"". The user is talking about AMZN not being done with dumping, which suggests cautious optimism. They're also mentioning that they'll see a 200sma on 262 and are worried about who will hold the stock. This seems like positive sentiment towards the stock but again without explicit mention of gains or losses.

Putting it all together: The first tweet has a strong positive percentage move, which might be significant. However, other tweets are negative due to EBola news, selling on AMZN by the user, and speculative trading. There's some mixed signals about Amazon not being a dip but more in乐观ism.

I think the overall sentiment is uncertain because there are conflicting factors. The strong positive percentage could pull it up, but the negative outlooks and sell calls might drag it down. Maybe the stock isn't as expected to move in any particular direction yet."
2014-10-25,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at each tweet individually. Most of them seem to have negative sentiments because of quotes like ""can even see seeing a gap down candle"" and the mention of technical damage. The user either says ""improbable move!"" or they're indicating volatility with ""vol URL."" These are clearly negative.

Then there's some neutral content, especially when the user refers to the company as "" spy,"" which is a common term used in stock jokes. That might just be filler without any real impact on sentiment.

The positive tweets have fewer mentions of negative things and instead talk about other companies or trends, like Friday's fear outlook or product launches related to Amazon. These could either reinforce positive news or not change the overall mood much.

Some tweets are repetitive, repeating similar phrases multiple times, which suggests a lack of fresh information but doesn't necessarily make them more positive.

The majority of these tweets have negative elements, so when considering all 19, the overall sentiment is leaning towards Negative. This is because the vast majority of the comments highlight potential downfalls or risks for Amazon."
2014-10-26,Negative,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on Amazon's stock price. The user has given me five tweets, and each seems to be related to the stock being affected by the topic or event mentioned.

First, let me go through each tweet one by one and try to understand what they're saying. 

1. The first tweet says, ""Amazon's plunging stock price is a buying opportunity for patient investors : URL $ amzn"". So, it looks like Amazon's stock price is dropping a lot, which could be a positive sign because it might mean people are seeing value in the stock despite its drop.

2. The second and third tweets mention ""friday's fearful outlook as ebola hits nyc"" with multiple hashtags: spy, dia, amzn, tsla, tm, amazon, url, url. I'm not entirely sure what these hashtags represent, but they seem related to news about the event. If there's fear due to a health crisis like ebola, it might make Amazon stock look undervalued or even overpriced because people are cautious.

3. The fourth tweet is ""rt AT_USER barrons like everyone else is waiting for $ amzn to get cheaper"". This seems positive because it suggests that the price of Amazon might go down in the near future, which could mean the stock might rise again as it's more attractive. But wait, I'm not sure if this is a good outlook or just a comment from someone.

4. The fifth tweet says, ""rt AT_USER friday's fearful outlook as ebola hits nyc : $ spy $ dia $ amzn $ tsla $ tm amazon - - URL URL"". Similar to the second and third tweets, it mentions fear due to ebola but with different hashtags: spy, dia, tsla, tm, amazon. Again, this could be indicating that the stock is undervalued or people are selling.

Now, I need to break down each tweet into factors and sentiments. For each tweet, I should check if there's an increase or decrease in the stock price (Positive/Neutral/Negative). Let me list them out:

1. Plunging stock price → Positive
2. Fearful outlook due to ebola → Could be Negative because fear might reduce value.
3. Similar to tweet 2 and 4, same reason for fear reduction.
4. Similar to 2 and 3; fear reducing the value.
5. Same reasoning as 2 and 4.

Looking at the factors:

1. Plunging: + (Positive)
2. Fearful outlook → - (Negative)
3. Similar to 2 and 4, so also -
4. Same as others: -
5. Same as 2-4: -

Sentiments per tweet: mostly a mix of + and -, but the main trend is mixed.

Now, how do these factors affect the overall sentiment? Each tweet is separate. So, some are positive, others negative. But I don't have data on whether each tweet was seen by enough people or if their collective impact outweighs one tweet's effect.

If several tweets mention similar events and suggest that stock prices might decrease due to fear, it could indicate a cautious market but not necessarily a clear upward trend. However, without knowing how many readers or sentiment indicators were tracking these posts, I can't be certain about the overall positive impact.

The output needs to be a single line with [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Since some tweets are negative and others are positive, it's hard to say for sure if it's positive, neutral, or negative. It could be considered somewhat mixed but leaning towards Neutral because there's both positive and negative sentiment.

Alternatively, since the majority of the tweets are negative (tweets 2-5), perhaps the overall impact is Negative.

Wait, let me double-check: only tweet 1 mentions a positive trend. The rest are negative due to fear. So if I have to pick based on the majority, it's mostly negative, but tweet 1 might balance it slightly towards Positive.

But in terms of overall sentiment for all five tweets, since some are neutral (tweet 3 and 4), I'm not sure. However, without knowing how many readers were tracking each post, it's hard to assess accurately.

Since the user provided specific tags, maybe I should consider that there are multiple negative factors but one positive factor. It's a mix but leans towards Negative because of the significant fear mentioned in tweets 2-5."
2014-10-27,Negative,"Alright, let's see what I need to do here. So, the task is to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on a company's stock price. The user provided four tweets about a specific company and wants an analysis using [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, looking at the target stock, I think it must be Amazon because some of the tweets mention things like AMZN (Amazon), spy (which is Sypnogenix, a start-up in AI),FB (Facebook), and other tech stocks. So, probably the stock to analyze is Amazon.

Next, each tweet needs to be broken down into factors—positive and negative—and then assess their impact on sentiment. 

Looking at tweet 1: It mentions several indices like S&P 500, DAX, IBIO, Tesla, and Quantheta. It's talking about tech earnings reports or something related. Since it's just a series of stock symbols without specific info, I think each one is neutral.

Tweet 2 talks about Jeff Bezos losing more than any tech billionaire in 2014. That sounds like bad news because Jeff is a big tech figure and losing money would hurt the company. This negative statement could push sentiment down.

Tweet 3 mentions Twitter's profitability compared to Amazon, but Twitter was also struggling that year with issues like data privacy and user concerns. So both tweets are pointing towards the stock being affected negatively due to economic or financial health issues.

Lastly, tweet 4 introduces a new publishing program but no specifics on how it affects Amazon. It could be neutral unless there's a hidden positive note, which I don't see here.

Putting it all together: negative factors from tweets 2 and 3, plus some minor thoughts in tweet 4 that might not add much. So overall sentiment is negative."
2014-10-28,Positive,"Okay, let's figure out the impact on AT_USER's stock based on these tweets. 

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at all the tweets, they seem to be talking about Amazon (AMZN). So the stock is AMZN.

Now, for each tweet, I'll analyze the factors and sentiment.

1. The first tweet says: ""AT_USER look at $ kss for instance . or $ amzn . neither really indicative of a consumption binge * at all * ."" This seems like a negative comment about a specific market index (kss) unrelated to AMZN, so not directly impacting AMZN.

2. Second tweet is a reaction on Twitter: ""rt AT_USER $ am zn to spend $ 1 + bln on a data center in ohio for cloud computing ( an utter profitless commodity business ) URL."" This clearly says that AMZN is spending money on a data center, which implies they are investing heavily. So this is a positive factor.

3. Third tweet: "" $ twtr $ am zn $ cmg $ nflx all have gapped down after eps . i explain this in the video how to approach price using rr . where the risk reward is."" This mentions AMZN's stock (AMZN) and others like TwTR, CMG, NFLX. It's talking about a stock gap situation after earnings, which could be positive or negative depending on context. It's speculative, so it might not directly impact AMZN.

4. Fourth tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ am zn spiking now - guess folks realizing now its not going down to $ 200"" The word ""spiking"" indicates an increase in price, which is positive for sentiment.

5. Fifth tweet: ""AT_USER low as $ 285 ... its now $ 295 . $ am zn is like freddy krueger ... its always arises no matter how shitty."" This is a minor increase from $285 to $295, which is positive for AMZN.

Putting it all together: The tweets mostly talk about investment strategies and price trends. They mention spending on data centers (positive), stock gaps (could be mixed but not sure), and slight increases (positive). So overall sentiment seems positive."
2014-10-29,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets regarding their impact on Amazon's stock price.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER amazon stock : gambling on jeff bezos URL $ amzn"". Hmm, that seems incomplete because it starts with ""rt AT_USER"" which probably isn't a stock symbol. It mentionsjeff bezos and the price of Amazon ($ amzn). Wait, maybe there's a typo here. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps it's supposed to be ""rt user amazon stock: gambling on jeff bezos URL $ amzn"". But that still seems off because AT_USER isn't a known company or even a common symbol. Maybe the actual stock is Amazon (AMZN). So I'll assume the target stock is AMZN.

Next, looking at the second tweet: ""$ spy in the red , $ x $ amzn and others from watch list that are green today . URL"". This one mentions SPY, which stands for spy stocks or perhaps S&P 500 ETFs. It's talking about the price of Amazon relative to other SPY ETFs. So maybe this tweet is focusing on AMZN compared to others in a broader market context.

The third tweet: ""annual lows : $ coh $ crox $ cvlt $ cbr $ dmd $ cbd $ resi $ viv $ tsu $ xnet $ anf $ vmi $ cfx $ hubg $ amzn URL mkt stock analytics"". This seems like a list of prices for various cryptocurrencies and tokens. It mentions AMZN again, but it's part of a broader context about market trends related to tech and crypto.

Now, I'll analyze each tweet in terms of factors: positive or negative. 

1. The first tweet is vague and might not provide enough information. But since it refers to Jeff Bezos, which isn't related to Amazon, there's probably no positive or negative intent here.
2. The second tweet mentions AMZN being ""green today"" relative to other SPY ETFs. That could imply that AMZN is undervalued compared to others in the market, which might suggest some potential for a price increase but not necessarily a guaranteed gain.
3. The third tweet discusses cryptocurrency prices and includes AMZN as part of market analytics, specifically related to tech and crypto. This indicates a focus on tech stocks and their relative performance in the broader market.

Next, assess the sentiment of each tweet towards Amazon's stock. 

- The first tweet is missing context about Amazon's actions regarding Jeff Bezos or other factors.
- The second tweet suggests AMZN is performing well compared to others, which could mean investors are expecting positive reactions from AMZN.
- The third tweet, while not explicitly stating a decision about AMZN, mentions tech and crypto trends, indicating some interest in AMZN as part of broader market movements.

Putting it all together, the main focus seems towards AMZN's position relative to other tech stocks, which could indicate investor confidence or expectations. However, since there's no direct mention of Amazon making an action regarding their stock (like a buy, sell, or transaction), the overall sentiment is more about sentiment analysis rather than specific actions.

Given that the tweets are more about market trends and relative performance, they might not directly impact Amazon's stock price in a significant way. Therefore, the combined sentiment seems neutral."
2014-10-30,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given tweets are likely to positively or negatively impact the stock price of Amazon. Let's break down each tweet and analyze them step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock from each tweet. The stocks mentioned are Amazon (AMZN), Starbucks (SBUX), and Google (GOOG). Each tweet has a different focus, so I need to make sure I'm focusing on the correct stock for the analysis.

1. The first tweet mentions $ amzn stock quote at 9:47 am with a price of 294.15, an increase of +0.03% or +0.01%. This is about the stock's current price and a small percentage change. Since it doesn't mention any positive or negative sentiment towards Amazon's performance, I can't infer much from this tweet alone.

2. The second tweet says something about ""all out the $ amzn short + 4 ... URL."" That sounds like Amazon is involved in a stock short position with an increase of 4. A stock short is a strategy where you sell shares you believe will go down, so if it's a positive move for you, that could indicate support or expectation of price movement.

3. The third tweet mentions Starbuck, Amazon, and Google accusing of being ""immoral"" with SBUX $ sbux $ goog $ amzn URLs. The term ""immoral"" is controversial and usually relates to issues like discrimination or unethical practices. If Amazon and Google are linked to moral issues, it might imply that their products or services could be problematic. This could lead to a decrease in demand for their stock as people expect them to be harmful, but I'm not sure if this is strong enough to determine a positive or negative impact on the stock price.

4. The fourth tweet says that $ amzn is ""double 11"" and Amazon is offering | companies | URL URL. Double 11 refers to a sale during the holiday season, so it's likely a promotion or event related to Christmas sales. Offering products for this sale might increase demand if the product lines are related to consumer goods or holiday items. This could lead to an increase in Amazon's stock price as people are buying more due to promotions.

Now, compiling these thoughts:

- The first tweet doesn't provide much info about Amazon.
- The second suggests a short position expected to go up.
- The third implies potential issues with the companies involved, which might affect demand but is vague.
- The fourth refers to a sale during Christmas, suggesting increased sales and thus an increase in stock price.

Putting it all together: There's a mix of possible positive elements from promotions and the possibility of Amazon responding to negative mentions. However, without concrete data or explicit information about Amazon's fundamentals (like revenue, profit margins, etc.), it's hard to determine a clear overall impact. But considering the double 11 promotion is likely to boost demand, which usually translates into higher stock prices, I'm leaning towards a positive sentiment.

I should also consider other factors like market conditions, company performance, economic indicators, and news events. Since this information isn't provided, I'll go with the most probable scenario based on the promotions."
2014-10-31,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has given me a set of tweets and wants me to determine their impact on a company's stock price by assigning them as [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, I need to understand the structure they provided. They've outlined steps: identifying the target stock symbol, analyzing each tweet for positive and negative factors, evaluating sentiment, and then summarizing into an overall tone.

Looking at the tweets:

1. The first one mentions a user buying more Amazon calls for $0.24. That seems like a buy action, which could indicate some optimism about Amazon's stock.

2. The second tweet talks about closing 30 stores in Japan and includes URLs for WMT and AMZN. While the exact impact isn't clear, mentioning closing stores might imply strategic moves that could be seen as positive by investors, especially if they align with growth or diversification goals.

3. The third tweet highlights Tesla's performance and mentions multiple companies: A lapsing into tech stocks like TSLA, AMZN, BABA. This looks like a stock buy signal from a tech analyst, which is usually seen as positive because tech tends to be undervalued.

4. The fourth tweet is more about sentiment after Amazon's earnings call. It says they bought at 279.50 and noted a +10% gain in a week without shabby. This seems like positive news affecting their stock price, indicating confidence or expectation of profit.

Putting it all together, each tweet has mixed signals but leans towards positive sentiment. The user might be someone looking for quick investment opportunities or identifying trends. Since the overall stance is optimistic across the board—buying signals and positive earnings reports—the final conclusion should reflect a positive overall impact."
2014-11-01,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how these tweets will affect Amazon's stock price. Let me start by breaking it down step by step. The first thing is identifying the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at tweet number 1: ""monthly income strategy from straddles URL $ amzn $ fb $ twtr"". Hmm, that looks like a combination of three stocks: AMZN (Amazon), FB (Facebook), and TWTR (Twitter). Since it mentions all three, I think the target stock is Amazon.

Next, I need to analyze each tweet one by one. The first tweet says, ""monthly income strategy from straddles URL $ amzn $ fb $ twtr"". This seems like a marketing or promotional message for Amazon, offering something related to their monthly income strategies and promoting their presence on multiple platforms: Facebook, Twitter, and the internet (since URL is mentioned). It sounds like they're providing information or services that can be sold, which might attract investors looking for reliable, platform-based financial products.

Now, considering sentiment analysis. The tweet mentions ""monthly income strategy"" which could imply future potential income growth. The mention of a ""straddle"" suggests something like a buy-sell agreement or insurance to protect against price fluctuations. Since they're offering this on multiple platforms, it might create buzz and interest among investors looking for diversification options.

However, I'm not entirely sure if that's positive or negative. It seems like a promotional tool rather than a warning. Promotions can sometimes be seen as positive because they attract more people to explore new opportunities. But I should also consider the broader market conditions—if Amazon is currently performing well, this might boost their stock price. If things are down, it could have a mixed effect.

Looking at other tweets isn't provided here, but based on just this tweet alone, it's hard to say definitively. However, considering that it's part of a series with similar promotional content, the trend in the data might be positive for Amazon. The multiple mentions across different platforms could indicate consistent interest and promotion, which would likely contribute positively to stock price.

But wait, sometimes promotions can come from negative angles if they're meant to attract investors who are skeptical about the company's financial health or growth prospects. However, without specific information on Amazon's current situation, it's safer to assume that this is a positive promotional strategy aimed at diversifying investor exposure across multiple platforms and potential income sources.

In summary, considering the content of just one tweet might not be enough, but given that it's part of a series with similar content and mentions multiple companies, it leans towards a positive impact. The idea of offering financial strategies on various platforms could attract more investors willing to try different options."
2014-11-02,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by reading through each tweet carefully.

The first tweet is: ""Combining options with stocks URL $ amzn $. com $ fb $ twtr"". Hmm, this seems like a query or perhaps part of the tweet content, but it's not clear what information is being provided. I'm noticing that there are mentions of Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), and Twitter (TWTR). The word ""URL"" might be related to their websites.

The second tweet says: ""Combining options with stocks URL $ amzn $. com fb $ twtr"". This seems similar to the first one, just adding a bit more context. It's also asking about combining stock options on these platforms.

I'm not sure if this is part of an analysis or if it's extra information. Since I need to analyze the tweets for their impact on Amazon's stock price, maybe I should focus on the positive aspects they present.

Amazon is a major player in the tech industry and has a strong brand reputation. They're involved in many areas like e-commerce, cloud services, and artificial intelligence. These tweets seem to highlight their presence in key markets without pointing out any negative trends or problems.

I'm not seeing any specific warnings or concerns about declining performance or other issues. Instead, they're offering something related to stock options on their respective platforms. Since the main focus is on their business activities rather than financial health, I don't think this indicates a positive impact on Amazon's stock price.

Therefore, considering these tweets are providing information without any negative comments, the overall sentiment should be neutral."
2014-11-03,Negative,"Okay, so I have to analyze these tweets to determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative in impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at each tweet individually and identifying the factors mentioned. 

The first tweet says, ""several incredible novels to help you to turbo-charge your kindle ! URL $ amzn bestsellers ( via AT_USER)"". Hmm, it mentions a product called an ""incredible novel"" that can turbo-chute your Kindle. I'm not sure if this is relevant to Amazon's stock because it doesn't mention anything about the company itself, its products, or financial performance.

The second tweet is: ""rt AT_USER at amazon , 63 % of employees world-wide are men . among managers , it's 75 % men . URL $ amzn URL"". This looks like a link to Twitter. The content seems to be discussing percentages of male employees and managers working for Amazon, which is a gender demographics question rather than anything related to stock performance.

Now, combining these two tweets together doesn't make sense because they are separate pieces of information. There's no mention of the company, any positive or negative actions Amazon has taken, or how this relates to its stock price. So each tweet individually isn't contributing much towards assessing the stock's impact.

Therefore, I don't see any factors that would indicate a positive or negative sentiment about Amazon's stock based on these tweets."

2014-11-05,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this task. The user provided a set of tweets and wants me to analyze their impact on a stock's future price. The possible responses are [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking through each tweet, it seems like ""amzn"" is mentioned frequently, so that must be the stock symbol we're focusing on: Amazon.

Next, for each tweet, I have to separate positive and negative factors. Let's go through them one by one:

1. ""$ amzn a nice pop but stk goes to 300 after jan"": This seems neutral because it's saying Amazon is doing well and rising, which isn't necessarily bad or good.
2. ""worth noting : einhorn very carefully avoids saying he is short $ amzn URL w / AT_USER"": The mention of einhorn avoiding stating he's short could indicate caution, but it's more about a person's words rather than the stock itself. So I'll consider this as neutral.
3. ""$ google's cloud war ratchets up URL $ googl $ amzn $ ibm $ goog"": The term ""cloud war"" is a bit vague, and Ratchets up might mean something bad or good? It could be affecting both Google and Amazon, but without more context, it's hard to say. Let me put this as neutral for now.
4. ""$ onvo 3 - d-printed organs are on the way ! URL $ aapl $ amzn $ baba $ dust $ fb $ goog $ jnug $ nugt $ tsla URL"": This tweet is talking about future developments in tech companies. I'm not sure how this directly affects Amazon, but it might be related to the broader tech sector. Maybe neutral.
5. ""$ 3 - d-printed organs are on the way ! URL $ aapl $ amzn $ baba $ dust $ fb $ goog $ jnug $ btc $ ltc $ btcusd URL"": Similar to tweet 4, talking about future developments, which could impact the tech sector. Neutral.
6. ""now that the AT_USER mirage bubble has popped , maybe the same happens to $ amzn & other ponzi scams realityisharsh"": This seems positive because it's suggesting a potential trend or event affecting Amazon, indicating growth. So I'll mark this as Positive.
7. ""i doubt greenlightpinellas or gasthalner will comment but can anyone argue this is not a short ? URL $ amzn"": The mention of people arguing that Greenlight won't comment suggests cautiousness, which could be seen as neutral because it's more about the environment than the stock itself.
8. ""AT_USER says $ amzn is testing taxi delivery in los angeles . there are taxis in l . a . ? AT_USER AT_USER"": This tweet is talking about a specific event related to a company (testing taxi delivery) but doesn't directly impact Amazon's performance. So it's Neutral.

Now, summarizing each tweet:
1. Neutral
2. Neutral
3. Neutral
4. Maybe Neutral
5. Maybe Neutral
6. Positive
7. Neutral
8. Neutral

Looking at the overall sentiment: Most tweets are neutral or slightly positive. The one about ponzi scams is more about a possible future event, which could be seen as a sign of growth. So I think this leans towards a Positive sentiment because it's suggesting something might happen that's favorable for Amazon."
2014-11-06,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of Amazon, AMZN.

Looking at tweet 1, it's not in the FAQ, so I'll have to check if ""how will AT_USER handle privacy with Alexa"" is relevant. It seems like a possible question but doesn't mention any positive or negative factors, just a general question. So maybe neutral.

Tweet 2 mentions RT and asks if AT_USER may be flirting with $AMZN short. The user is interacting with someone else, which might imply interest in the stock. This could mean that people are considering buying AMZN. So this seems positive.

Tweet 3 talks about gains of 483% and an giveaway for everyone. High gains and a giveaway can be seen as good news because it's a big deal. That's definitely positive.

Tweet 4 is RT asking if you can legally yell 'fire' in a crowded store. Yelling at customers is generally not advised, so this might indicate concern or hesitation about AMZN’s products or services. So negative sentiment here.

Tweet 5 mentions margin and growth with TSLA having both. Positive factors could boost the stock price. The user thinks about future performance based on past trends, which can be positive.

Tweet 6 talks about $CNQ boosting 2015 output despite falling prices. This might indicate financial stability or better market conditions, so positive.

Tweet 7 and 8 mention TSLA breaking levels in various stocks. High thresholds could signal strength or potential for growth, contributing to a positive sentiment.

Tweet 9 is similar to tweet 7-8 but again just states the numbers without context. It's high levels but doesn't specify what they relate to, so maybe neutral.

Tweet 10 talks about being long AMZN and short another stock. This can be seen as risk management or strategic positioning, which might not be directly impacting stock price but is part of strategy. So this could be neutral overall since it's a specific trade, not necessarily affecting the current stock performance.

Putting all these together: some tweets are positive about new products, gains, and good news. Others suggest concerns about safety (yelling at customers) or strategic moves. The overall sentiment seems mixed but leans towards positive because there are clear trends like high gains, relevant questions, and good news. However, the mention of potential issues with customer interactions could be a dip in sentiment.

But wait, some tweets are pretty direct about the current situation, which might suggest that AMZN is doing well right now. Also, the user engagement on tweet 1 suggests they're looking at privacy concerns, but if it's not directly impacting stock performance, maybe it's neutral or slightly positive because they're researching future.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn. There are some definitely positive tweets, others more uncertain. Maybe the overall sentiment is Neutral because there are conflicting signals."
2014-11-07,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for AMZN. 

Starting with the first tweet, it says that our penny stock gained 80% today and also mentioned a special giveaway. That sounds like a positive sign because an 80% gain is quite significant, especially in finance where small gains can make a big difference. Positive factors here include the penny stock being picked up and the giveaway.

Next, tweet number two talks about a girl being prettiest in a house at WSU. Hmm, that's not related to AMZN directly. It seems like someone is talking about beauty without any mention of the company or its stock performance. So this tweet isn't contributing much positive or negative sentiment towards AMZN.

Tweet three mentions Amazon launching an Echo device, which is clearly related to their products and services. This suggests a positive investment appeal because more people are investing in tech companies, so it's expected that their stock would rise. The hashtag URL might be leading people to check out the product, which could influence investor sentiment positively.

Then there's tweet four where an AT_USER is announcing something like a Siri-like device but specifically for a speaker with Bluetooth. This also ties into Amazon and tech companies in general. More active tech companies often have strong stock prices because they're seen as innovative. So this is another positive factor pointing towards AMZN gains.

Lastly, tweet five provides the stock price for AMZN on a specific date (11/07/2014) and talks about its market performance with a max pain of 295.00 and a last close at $296.64. The max pain number might indicate volatility or recent issues, but the positive price movement still suggests the stock is performing well.

Now, combining all these factors: the penny stock being on fire (80% gain), tech company announcements with tech firms in general, and a clear stock price trend. So overall, it seems like there's positive sentiment around AMZN. All the tweets either positively mention tech companies or significant gains that indicate strong performance."
2014-11-08,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of RighRight Mile, which is listed as ""righ rightsmile inc."" Looking at the first tweet, it mentions that a prominent editor's exit has caused a setback for Amazon's publishing unit. Since the stock is Amazon, this might imply that the negative aspect affects the overall company performance or perhaps an external factor impacting Amazon's operations indirectly.

The second tweet is a bit confusing with multiple dollar signs and some text. It seems to be part of a URL structure but isn't very clear on what it's conveying. The presence of ""unch"" could mean something about the stock moving against its price, maybe lower than expected. However, without more context, I can't determine if this is an accurate or positive message.

Considering both tweets, the first one points towards Amazon's publishing unit being negatively impacted by a major factor, which might be external to Amazon itself. The second tweet is unclear but could hint at market sentiment affecting Amazon. Since neither tweet provides strong confirmation about RighRight Mile's performance, it's hard to assess their direct impact on the stock price.

Therefore, with limited information and ambiguous content in the second tweet, I can't confidently determine if these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative regarding RighRight Mile's stock."
2014-11-09,Positive,"Alright, I've got to analyze these tweets to figure out how they might impact the stock price of Amazon. Let me start by breaking down what's given.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER one of the thing that has always fascinated me about bitcoin : supposedly disruptive tech companies all slow to adopt : $ amzn , …"" It seems like it's about Bitcoin (BTC) because BTC and AMZN are both mentioned, but more specifically, the focus is on Bitcoin since that's the main topic here. So I'll note BTC as the target stock.

Now, moving on to each tweet one by one. The user is mentioning Bitcoin as a tech company that seems to adopt companies slowly, which makes me think Bitcoin might be a growth stock because it's often expected to grow but also its adoption can be slow over time.

The second tweet isn't provided, so I'll skip this one for now and note that the information is missing. Similarly, there are more tweets, but they aren't fully transcribed, so I'll assume each subsequent tweet gives some more information about Bitcoin's growth potential or other factors affecting Amazon.

I should assess whether each tweet contributes positively, negatively, or neutrally to the stock price. Let me go through them one by one:

1. First tweet: The user is talking about Bitcoin and suggests it's a disruptive company that adopts companies slowly. This might mean there are opportunities for growth in the tech sector, which could be positive for Amazon if they see Bitcoin as a competitive or future player.

2. Since the second tweet isn't provided, I can't assess it. Maybe it talks about other factors like demand, competition, or regulatory changes affecting Amazon?

3. Third tweet: Not provided either. Perhaps it discusses something else entirely, but without more info, hard to say.

4. Fourth and fifth tweets are also missing in the context given, so I'll have to infer based on existing knowledge. Let's assume they might discuss other aspects like financial performance, management, or global events affecting Amazon.

Now, combining all these factors: The user is indicating a positive outlook for Bitcoin, suggesting it's a growth company, which could mean Amazon has potential in tech or related sectors. Missing data for the other tweets might limit their analysis, but overall, there's a hint of optimism about Bitcoin's growth prospects.

I think considering the positive mention of Bitcoin as a disruptive company with slow adoption and that such companies can grow over time, it might boost Amazon's stock price positively. So I'll conclude it's [Positive] in sentiment."

2014-11-24,Neutral,"Okay, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price by analyzing each tweet and combining their effects.

First, looking at tweet 1, it mentions free research on several indices but doesn't provide a specific action. It seems like it might not be very actionable or significant enough for investors, so maybe neutral.

Tweet 2 talks about the AMZN share price moving with a pivot point. This is a technical analysis move that could indicate some bullish momentum, but without more context, I'm not sure if it's strong enough to tip the scale positively.

Tweet 3 also mentions specific stock prices and mentions actions like parabolic SAR, which suggests potential for a correction. However, this seems too volatile or not actionable, so probably neutral.

Tweet 4 is from Amazon and talks about a downtrend that's broken with some support. This could mean the company is starting to recover, but it's still in a mixed state, making me cautious of jumping to positive.

Tweet 5 discusses future strategies for EMCO, which isn't directly related to AMZN's stock price. It might influence investor sentiment indirectly but I don't see enough specifics here.

Tweet 6 talks about new trades involving several companies but doesn't mention AMZN at all. So probably not affecting Amazon's performance negatively or positively right now.

Tweet 7 asks for the latest on another index, which is too vague without specific info. It might be useful for someone else but not helpful here.

Tweets 8 and 9 are about comparing AMZN with Walmart and other companies via AT_USER. These don't mention stock prices or anything related to Amazon's stock. So they probably aren't impacting the overall sentiment of AMZN's stock.

Tweet 10 is about a stock quote, but again, without details on AMZN or other companies involved, it's hard to see an impact.

Putting all this together, most tweets are either too vague or don't directly relate to Amazon. Some mention trends that might indicate potential positives, others show caution. Since there's no actionable information, the overall sentiment is neutral."
2014-11-25,Negative,"Alright, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a given company. The user has provided 16 tweets and wants me to analyze their effect. 

First, let's identify the target stock from each tweet. The first tweet mentions ""amzn"" in various URLs. So, AmZN is the likely target.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one. For each, I'll extract the relevant information:

1. ""will they buy angi's list ? ' amazon wants to help you find a plumber' - URL $ amzn $ angi""
   - No explicit mention of Amzn's performance or stock price change.

2. ""coming up tomorrow on AT_USER AT_USER - - black & blue friday , featuring AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER $ amzn $ wmt URL""
   - Only mentions the event, not related to AmZN.

3. ""the morning dump - nov 25th reign malware $ aapl tmobile $ amzn drone faa aids samsung at user url""
   - No mention of Amzn.

4. ""rt $ tsla algos triggered sell @ 09:50 in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx p / t 240 $ baba $ bidu $ pcln $ goog $ fb $ amzn $ gpro $ nflx $ aapl $ qqq hft""
   - ""algos"" could indicate that TSLA is selling, which might affect AmZN's stock.

5. ""$ cst top performing stocks today $ wbc $ nke $ am zn$ wealthmanagement url""
   - Talks about Amzn as one of the top performers, suggesting support from others.

6. ""rt $ qqq algos triggered sell @ 13:33 in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx p / t 104 $ baba $ bidu $ pcln $ goog $ fb $ am zn $ gpro $ nflx $ aapl $ tsla hft""
   - Similar to tweet 4, TSLA selling could impact Amzn.

7. ""how to trade bear calls with probability URL $ am zn $ fb $ twtr""
   - No direct mention of stock performance.

8. ""looking for research on dnr crm url""
   - Not related.

9. ""rt $ tsla algos triggered sell @ 15:50 in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx p / t 240 $ baba $ bidu $ pcln $ goog $ fb $ am zn $ gpro $ nflx $ aapl $ qqq hft""
   - TSLA selling again.

10. ""rt $ tsla algos broke 248 level in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx p / t 240 $ baba $ bidu $ pcln $ goog $ fb $ am zn $ gpro $ lnkd $ nflx $ aapl $ qqq hft""
   - Another indication of TSLA's performance.

11. ""stock market reports you need on atr fdx amgn amzn i suggest url""
   - No mention.

12. ""stocks you might want to buy hsic mwv ev am zn must have url""
   - No info.

13. ""$ nem volume $ nem most recent stock chart and technical analysis . $ wfm ac.to ko t lqd am zn url url""
   - Amzn's presence on a tech report but no performance data.

14. ""prepare to cry : here's what tech company interns are being paid. url aapl am zn goog lnkd znga""
   - No mention of stock price changes.

15. ""rt $ tsla algos triggered sell @ 11:08 in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats, lx p/t 240 ... hft""
   - TSLA selling again.

16. ""$ am zn low risk from now on ? ? URL""
   - No data.

Looking at the tweets, Amzn is being sold by TSLA multiple times (tweets 4, 9, 10). This could mean that Amzn's stock might be affected as a result of TSLA's actions. But since each tweet is separate and doesn't specify a specific time frame or impact on their own performance, it's hard to determine the overall sentiment solely from these tweets. They only provide info about TSLA selling to some extent.

Therefore, without explicit information about Amzn's stock price movements or market trends, I can't conclude if there's positive, negative, or neutral impact."
2014-11-26,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out how to determine the impact on Amazon's stock price based on the given tweets. Let me start by breaking down each tweet and understanding what they're saying.

First, I should extract the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at them, some have AMZN in the middle of words or parts of URLs like ""url"". For example, tweet 1 says ""$ stocks you might want to hold onto $ hot $ lsi $ dri $ amzn financial URL"" So the target stock is AMZN.

Next, I need to analyze each tweet as a factor and assess its sentiment towards the stock. Each tweet can be either positive (P), negative (N), or neutral (U) for that specific tweet. Then, I'll look at how these tweets collectively influence investor sentiment overall.

Let me go through each tweet one by one:

1. ""stocks you might want to hold onto $ hot $ lsi $ dri $ amzn financial URL"" - The sentiment here seems neutral because it's talking about holding stocks and doesn't express a clear positive or negative opinion.
   
2. ""bad invesments like got you down $ rai $ fl $ gild $ amzn economy URL"" - Negative, as it's talking about bad investments leading to financial issues.

3. ""stock market reports on stocks like $ lpi $ are $ cxw $ amzn give it a try URL"" - Neutral, just suggesting they can try something else but not necessarily giving sentiment.
   
4. ""why technical analysis is critical in trading URL $ amzn $ fb $ twtr"" - Positive, as it highlights the importance of technical analysis for trading.

5. ""would you like great research on stocks $ dri $ ni $ xom $ amzn overvalued URL"" - Neutral, just offering research but not expressing sentiment.
   
6. ""looking for the next $ clh $ nuan $ utx $ amzn wealthmanagement URL"" - Positive, looking for future investment opportunities.

7. ""would you like great research on stocks $ alle $ amzn $ mlm $ cadx try this URL"" - Neutral, suggesting they can try something but not expressing sentiment.
   
8. ""rt $ tsla algos triggered buy @ 09:55 in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx p / t 252 $ baba $ bidu $ pcln $ goog $ fb $ amzn $ gpro $ nflx $ aapl $ qqq hft"" - This seems very positive, as it mentions specific actions and is offering research on several stocks.
   
9. ""$ ebay $ am zn URL"" - Positive, acknowledging the expansion of Amazon's product or service (eBay) which could boost AMZN.

10. ""great pennystock research $ pgr $ hes $ chs $ amzn must have URL"" - Positive, promoting a stock for investment.

11. ""are you bullish on these stocks $ utx $ gas $ tk $ am zn check out URL"" - Positive, indicating support among investors.
   
12. ""awesome stock research on $ mo $ thg $ fl $ amzn wallstreet URL"" - Positive, highlighting the need for stock research.

13. ""$ tw are you hanging on to $ qep $ twx $ am zn research URL"" - Neutral, as it's just a suggestion without sentiment.

Now, summarizing each tweet's impact:

- Negative: 2
- Neutral: 1, 3, 4, 6,7
- Positive: 5,8,9,10,11,12

Looking at the positive tweets (8,9,10,11,12), several are very strong and directly offering advice on research or products. These seem to be strong indicators that AMZN is being encouraged by investors.

The negative tweet (2) is clear about bad investments leading to financial issues, which could negatively impact the stock price.

Other neutral tweets don't express sentiment and may not have a significant effect. The positive ones are offering specific, actionable advice which could lead to investor confidence.

Considering all these, despite some negative news, there's strong support from several positive tweets promoting AMZN for research or investment opportunities. This suggests that overall sentiment is positive."
2014-11-27,Neutral,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided four tweets and wants me to determine their impact on Amazon's stock price using a scoring system of Positive, Neutral, or Negative. I need to follow the given solving process.

First, I'll identify the target stock from each tweet. The main stock mentioned across all tweets is AMZN. So, that's clear—AMZN is the stock we're analyzing.

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate into Positive and Negative factors. Let me go through them one by one.

1. ""AT_USER the ws consensus for $ amzn q4 2014 has shifted significantly downwards - URL"" – This seems neutral because it's talking about the stock price changing, not anything positive or negative related to AMZN itself.

2. ""are you looking for more winners like $ vmw $ rrd $ xel $ amzn visit URL"" – Again, this is just mentioning other stocks and their names; no specific information about AMZN here.

3. ""AT_USER AT_USER has one of the best return policy for audio books you can ever find . thank you . amazon $ amzn . URL"" – This tweet is positive because it's talking about a product (audio books) with excellent customer service, which could indicate good reviews and possibly positive sentiment towards AMZN.

4. ""find out the latest on $ pdco $ esrx $ amgn $ am zn liquidity URL"" – This one is also neutral as it doesn't mention any stock performance or analysis related to AMZN.

Now, combining these analyses: three tweets are neutral (1 and 2), one is positive (3). Since there's a mix but the majority are neutral, I should average them. The positive sentiment has one tweet supporting, which might be overrepresented compared to just two neutrals. However, without knowing the exact weight or how the sentiments are aggregated, it's safer to consider that some positivity could affect the overall score.

Given that there's a clear positive statement but it's not overwhelmingly present, I'll lean towards a Neutral conclusion because while AMZN is doing well in reviews, stock performance alone might be influenced by other factors. But considering that one out of four tweets is positive and others are neutral or flat, I think the overall sentiment should remain Neutral."
2014-11-28,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets about the stock price for Amazon and their impact on the future stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First tweet: ""AT_USER the ws consensus for $ amzn q4 2014 has shifted significantly downwards - URL"". This seems like a negative statement suggesting that Amazon's Q4 2014 consensus price is moving down, which might indicate expectations of lower earnings or something else affecting their stock. So this could be a negative factor.

Second tweet: ""investing news 11/28 $ cvx $ wmt $ amzn $ dal $ luv $ jblu cvx wmt am zn luv #jblu URL"". This seems like a list of stocks and some hashtags. It's more about the companies listed, but I'm not sure how this directly affects Amazon's stock price or sentiment. Maybe it's just background information without strong signals.

Third tweet: ""AT_USER the ws consensus for $ amzn q4 2014 has shifted significantly downwards - URL"". Similar to the first tweet, again talking about a shift in the consensus price, which is a negative thought. The link suggests that the user is taking action or something.

Fourth tweet: ""the best black friday stocks ... $ tgt $ m $ jwn $ tjx $ amzn $ aapl $ gpro $ gme $ bby $ atvi $ ttwo $ vfc $ cst $ logi"". Again, this is about listing other companies. No indication of stock performance or sentiment here.

Fifth tweet: ""so now $ amzn competes with URL taking "" everything from a to z "" a bit far , no ?"". This seems to indicate that Amazon is competing with something that has everything from A-Z, which might imply competition in general. It doesn't specifically mention the stock's performance or sentiment about it.

Putting this together: The first and third tweets are negative because they make statements about the stock price moving down, which can affect investor expectations. The fourth tweet isn't relevant to Amazon. The second tweet is background info without direct impact. The fifth is general competition but not directly related to Amazon's stock.

Since the main negatives are from the first and third tweets, and these seem to be specific negative signals about the stock price or market sentiment, I think the overall sentiment is Negative. The other tweets don't provide strong enough information."
2014-11-29,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on Amazon's stock price. I'm just starting to learn about stock analysis, so I'll take it step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol mentioned in the tweets is AMZN. So I know we're talking about Amazon. Now, each tweet has a part where they mention factors or sentiment towards the stock. Let me go through them one by one.

The first tweet says: ""rt AT_USER saturday links : overnight blog sensations , why uber fights and deep explorations . URL $ amzn $ rsh $ n …"" It seems like this tweet is just continuing a conversation, talking about Uber's fights and something else. It doesn't mention any positive or negative aspects about Amazon, so I don't think it affects the stock.

The second tweet reads: ""$ amzn stocksentiment score of only 540 ... still plenty of room to upside on this one ."" Here, they're mentioning a stock sentiment score of 540. Wait, but stock sentiment scores are usually from -100 to +100. Maybe that's just a typo or maybe it was meant to say something else like ""satisfaction."" If the score is positive and high, it could mean good news for Amazon. So I'll consider this as a Positive tweet.

The third tweet: ""rt AT_USER not too surprised : $ amzn reported blackfriday was its busiest sales day ever , w / more than 3k deals and selling roughly 64 …"" This one is also just a reply, talking about Black Friday sales. It doesn't mention any positive or negative events related to Amazon's stock, so this tweet doesn't impact the overall sentiment.

So putting it all together: The first tweet isn't affecting AMZN, the second is somewhat positive, and the third is neutral because they're just discussing market events. 

I think the overall sentiment from these tweets suggests a Positive outlook for Amazon because there are mentions of good news like high sales on Black Friday and investor excitement from the blog discussions about Uber fights. Even though one tweet was confusing, the others don't provide any negative insights.

Wait, but sometimes stock sentiment is influenced by other factors too. Maybe the user isn't engaging with the actual company's performance? Or maybe they're just discussing broader trends. I'm not entirely sure, but based on what's given, it seems like there's a positive note for Amazon."
2014-11-30,Neutral,"Okay, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for Amazon's stock price impact.

First, I need to identify each tweet and extract the target stock symbol. The first tweet is about the $/AMZN percent change, so AMZN seems relevant. Then, there are three more tweets but they seem to be discussing AT_USER's thoughts, which isn't tied to a specific stock. So maybe only AMZN is significant here.

Next, I should parse each relevant tweet and break them down into Positive (P) and Negative (N) factors. 

Looking at the first tweet, it mentions key resistance levels at $340 for Amazon. I'm not sure what ""key resistance"" means exactly, but if it's about price levels or potential support, that could indicate upward movement.

The second tweet talks about black Friday being the busiest day ever with 64 items per second. Black Friday is known as a sale, so maybe higher sales would boost Amazon's stock. However, I'm not sure how relevant this is unless it's a positive sign.

Third, AT_USER comments on downward mobility and compares living being better than working for Amazon, using something from channeladvisor. This seems like a critique of the job market or economy affecting Amazon's performance. It could be negative if the user thinks economic conditions are bad for Amazon's stock.

Now, considering overall sentiment: The first tweet is about price levels. If $340 is a resistance level, it might suggest bullish signs. But I'm not certain. Then there's the second tweet about high sales, which could add to demand and be positive. However, the third tweet seems to mention a negative viewpoint towards economic factors affecting Amazon.

I'm not entirely sure if these tweets collectively push the stock positively or negatively. The first might have some support, but I don't know enough about resistance levels. The second is strong on sales, which could drive up demand. The third is contradictory because it's a critique of economic conditions affecting Amazon's job market, which is usually positive for companies that rely on employment.

I'm leaning towards a Neutral stance because there are conflicting views from the tweets. Some support price movements, others point to positive sales and other factors, but mixed signals could be tricky."
2014-12-01,Positive,"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine the likely impact on Amazon's stock price based on the given tweets. The user has provided 10 tweets, and my task is to analyze them as per their instructions.

First, looking at the structure of the input: each tweet seems to be either a positive or negative statement about Amazon. My plan is to go through each tweet one by one, identify factors (positive and negative) in each, assess the sentiment based on these factors, and then summarize the overall impact.

Starting with tweet 1: ""rt AT_USER why the moody's ratings cut ? a look at amazon’s robot army : URL $ amzn URL."" The user is questioning how Amazon's robot army affects their performance. It seems like the tweet is expressing doubt or uncertainty about Amazon's future, which might imply concern about stock prices.

Moving to tweet 2: ""rt AT_USER amazon playing to its strengths with listing for plumbers and auto mechanics URL $ amzn url stocks daytrading trading mkt nyse nasdaq markets 227."" This is definitely a positive statement. The user is suggesting Amazon will list in these sectors, which could boost sales and market capitalization.

For tweet 3: ""rt AT_USER analyst updates for black friday sales $ tgt $ ebay $ amzn $ baba $ sbux $ luv URL follow AT_USER."" The mention of Black Friday sales being an analyst update suggests that Amazon's financial performance is improving, which is a positive indicator.

Tweets 4 and 5 are about analyst reports but they seem to focus on other companies like Target and Microsoft. Notably, tweet 7 mentions Analyst updates for Black Friday again, so the sentiment from previous tweets might carry over.

Tweet 8: ""rt AT_USER amazon playing to its strengths with listing for plumbers and auto mechanics URL $ amzn URL."" This reinforces Amazon's positive outlook on future successes in certain sectors, which is a strong positive factor.

Tweets 9 and 10 are about pennystock research. I'm not sure what specific stocks they're referring to but it seems like the user is providing updates that might be related to Amazon or other companies. Without more context, it's hard to assess their sentiment impact on Amazon, so maybe this tweet isn't as decisive.

Now, summarizing:

- Positive tweets: T 2 (ambush in strengths), T 3, T4, T7, T8.
- Negative tweets: None provided.

Considering the positive tweets are about future successes and analyst improving performance, which generally boosts stock prices. However, I should also consider that some factors might affect sentiment differently based on context or company-specific news. Since I don't have all the context here, it's a balance between strong positive factors versus potential negative ones from other sources.

So, overall, considering the positive tweets and the analyst updates, the sentiment leans toward positive but not entirely neutral."
2014-12-02,Positive,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the overall impact of these tweets on the stock price of Amazon (AMZN). Let me start by going through each tweet one by one.

1. **First tweet**: It mentions several companies like spy, aapl, iwm, tza, etc., but it doesn't specify what's happening with AMZN or anything else. So I can't tell much here.

2. **Second tweet**: Similar to the first; just unrelated information about AMZN's performance isn't helpful.

3. **Third and fourth tweets**: These are repeating the same message about AMZN being a technical weekday, but they don't provide any specific info on their stock.

4. **Fifth tweet**: This one is more focused. It says ""up to 34.21 % return in 1 month."" That sounds like good news for AMZN's future earnings, which usually affects the stock price positively.

5. **Sixth and seventh tweets**: Both mention Wal Mart reporting strong cyber Monday orders. This could impact Amazon because they might collaborate on e-commerce sales or supply chain issues. But it doesn't directly talk about AMZN performance.

6. **Eighth tweet**: Talks about AMZN's Cyber Monday reports but doesn't give any specific performance data, just a note to update the reader. Still not enough info for a clear sentiment.

7. **Ninth and tenth tweets**: Similar to the sixth ones; no specific info on AMZN except about their Cyber Monday issues or suggestions not directly related to stock movement.

8. **Eleventh tweet**: Suggests avoiding mistakes like two $wen $unh, which might imply avoiding losses, but again, not giving any details about AMZN performance.

9. **Twelfth and thirteenth tweets**: These are unrelated to AMZN. The user is asking for selling stock ideas or making investment suggestions that don't pertain to the company in question.

10. **Fourteenth tweet**: Similar to the eighth one; it's talking about technical stuff without any specific info on AMZN performance.

11. **Fifteenth and sixteenth tweets**: These are more general, suggesting avoiding losing money on certain financials like cmi or yhoo. Again, no direct info on Amazon.

12. **Seventeenth tweet**: Talks about upcoming opportunities with stocks to sell, which might influence price but not specifics about AMZN.

13. **Eighteenth and nineteenth tweets**: Similar to the twelfth, these are unrelated to AMZN.

14. **Twentieth tweet**: Again, general advice without specific details on AMZN.

15. **Twenty-first tweet**: Suggests watching certain stocks like tdg or dre, which could affect price but not specifically about Amazon.

16. **Twenty-second and thirty-fourth tweets**: Both mention NYSE data with opportunities for stocks to sell, which affects the stock market in general but not AMZN's performance.

17. **Thirty-fifth tweet**: Again, talking about stock selling ideas without any specific info on AMZN.

18. **Fortieth and fifty-first tweets**: Similar to the thirteenth one; unrelated to AMZN.

After going through all these tweets, the main positive point is the fifth tweet suggesting a 34% return in a month, which directly impacts the stock price positively. The other tweets are either unrelated or just general advice without specific company info. So overall, it seems like there's some positive information about future earnings for AMZN."
2014-12-03,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the likely impact on the stock price based on these tweets about a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. It seems like most of them mention things like $ebay, $amzn, $gpro, etc., so I'll have to guess which is the main one since the user didn't specify.

Next, for each tweet, I should separate positive and negative factors. Positive tweets likely highlight benefits or successes, while negative ones might focus on losses or drawbacks. But some tweets seem repetitive with similar content, like multiple mentions of ""rbt"" in a way, which could be just different versions or typos. That's why the user did separate them but it's not consistent.

Then, I'll assess the sentiment by looking at the overall tone and language. Positive tweets tend to use more positive adjectives and confirmations about successes. Negative ones might use negative adjectives or suggest losses. However, the repetitive nature of some tweets makes it hard to tell if they're consistently positive or just repeating similar statements.

Combining these analyses, I notice that most tweets are either positive with mentions of products like $ebay for electronics or $amzn for tech stocks, which usually indicate good company performance. The negative ones about investments suggest possible losses but don't provide much clarity. The repetitive nature might mean some concerns about consistency in the message but doesn't necessarily imply a negative overall sentiment.

Putting it all together, each positive tweet adds confidence and growth potential, while the negative ones show loss but aren't enough to outweigh the positives. So, overall, there's evidence of strong support with mixed results from some tweets, but without clear indicators of significant issues."
2014-12-04,Positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out the overall impact on Amzn's stock price based on these tweets. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, each tweet is about a relevant factor related to AmZN (Amzn). The goal is to analyze whether these factors are positive, negative, or neutral towards the stock.

Looking at the tweets:

1. RT mentions analyst's strategies for FNMA, APPL, BABA, AMZN.
2. RT talks about options strategies for AMZN, noting they can afford losing money on the ""fire phone.""
3. RT again lists cyber monday and black friday winners, mentioning eBay, TGT, AMZN.
4. RT quotes an AMZN stock quote showing a small drop of -0.69%.
5-17: These tweets seem repetitive, just repeating the same messages about AMZN's performance or strategies on these stocks. They don't really give any new information beyond what was already mentioned earlier.
18. RT again mentions options strategies for AMZN but without a quote.

Now, considering each tweet:

- Tweets 1 to 3 are all about analyst strategies and stock market trends. This is generally positive because it shows that there's confidence or potential in the stock based on future trends.
- Tweets 4 is an actual quote showing a small decline, which could indicate investor sentiment towards the stock but not a strong movement. However, the negative point of -0.69% might be considered part of the trend rather than a standalone event.
- The repeated tweets from 5 to 17 are all about market trends and analyst strategies, reinforcing that investors believe in AMZN's future performance.
- Tweet 18 is another quote showing a small drop, contributing to the overall negative sentiment.

Putting it together, the main themes are positive analysis of AMZN's future potential. While there are some negative points like the -0.69% loss and quotes about options strategies (which can be seen as risk-taking behavior from investors), these are not strong enough to outweigh the general confidence expressed in the tweets.

Therefore, despite a minor dip and occasional quotes with negative numbers, the overall sentiment seems positive because of the recurring positive analysis."
2014-12-05,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. The user has given me a list of 10 tweets with various factors mentioned. I need to break down each tweet to see if it contributes positively, neutrally, or negatively to the overall sentiment.

Starting with tweet 1: ""$ amzn buying $ 308 to average existing position."" Hmm, this seems like Amazon is increasing its inventory or stock by purchasing more shares. Positive action would probably boost their confidence and increase demand, so that's a positive factor.

 Tweet 2 mentions ""let's get ready for another great friday of trading !"" and lists multiple stocks including Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Netplay Limited (NTG), Facebook, Twitter, November XOR (NXL), and Amazon (AMZN again). It seems like it's encouraging the user to trade these stocks. Trading can be a volatile part of investing, but especially during these events or holidays, people are often more confident in their choices. So this is a positive indicator.

Tweet 3 talks about AT_USER being honest and suggesting that house of cards isn't better than what Amazon has done, focusing on movies instead. This seems like a critique or opinion, which might not directly impact the stock price but could influence investor views. It's ambiguous whether it's positive or negative because without context, it's hard to tell.

Tweets 4 and 5 mention that Amazon and Google are ""no bueno"" today. I'm not sure what ""no差点"" means in this context—it could be a typo or specific terms the user didn't translate correctly. Without clarity, it's difficult to assess the impact on the stock price.

Similarly, tweets 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are all about trading opportunities at various sites like eBay, Target (GTY), Apple Inc., November XOR, Facebook, Twitter, and the Coaches Roster. These seem to be encouraging the user to trade these stocks during specific events or holidays. Again, trading can be unpredictable, but it's a form of active management that might contribute positively if the user is well-informed.

Putting this together: tweet 1 boosts Amazon's confidence by purchasing more shares. Tweets 2 and 6-10 are encouraging trading efforts but lack specific data on how that would impact stock prices. Tweets 3 is speculative but could reflect investor sentiment towards certain stocks. So overall, the positive tweets seem to have a stronger influence on Amazon's outlook."
2014-12-06,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out how to determine the likely impact on the stock price of $AMZN based on these tweets. Let me start by breaking down each step.

First, I have to extract the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking through the list, I see a bunch of URLs and other mentions of AMZN. The most straightforward one is ""amzn"" followed by an underscore, so that's $AMZN. So the target stock is Amazon.

Next, for each tweet, I need to identify positive (Positive) and negative (Negative) factors. Then assess sentiment based on how these factors affect investor sentiment.

Looking at the tweets:

1. ""looking for more info on $ pcl $ sd $ mco $ amzn financialnews URL"" - This seems like a general request about finding more information, not specific to AMZN or any positive/negative trends.
2. ""rt AT_USER stock analyst finds best options strategies $ aapl $ baba $ amzn $ fnma URL"" - Here, the user is mentioning stock analysts and suggesting they find best options strategies for ABBV (aapl) and FNM (fnma), both of which are companies related to AMZN's financials. This seems neutral.
3. ""looking for more info on $ sial $ mo $ now $ amzn check out URL"" - Again, this is a general request for information about a specific stock, not positive or negative.
4. Similar to tweet 2, another mention of stock strategies and analysts. Probably just providing the same information again.
5. ""todays movers to research $ intu $ apa $ amtd $ amzn liquidity URL"" - This looks like it's mentioning liquidity as a factor. Liquidity is generally positive for investors because it allows them to buy or sell stocks easily, which can be a good selling point. So this might be a positive factor.
6. ""rt AT_USER stock analyst finds best options strategies $ aapl $ baba $ amzn $ fnma URL"" - Same as tweet 2; indicating the user is looking for analysis on financial strategies for these companies related to AMZN.
7. Another ""rt"" similar to the above, so probably just repeating the same info.
8. ""are you looking for winners like $ anss $ nycb $ els $ amzn worth a look URL"" - Here, the user is asking if they're looking for winners like ANSS, NYCB, ELS, and AMZN. This could indicate that these companies are performing well, so it's positive.
9. ""rt AT_USER stock analyst finds best options strategies $ aapl $ baba $ amzn $ fnma URL"" - Again, repeating the same information as tweet 2.
10. ""are you looking for winners like $ stwd $ emr $ els $ amzn overvalued URL"" - Another query about potential winners and overvaluation. This seems positive because it's indicating that these stocks might be overpriced.
11. ""5 stocks you should be watching $ ccl $ tfsl $ avp $ amzn try this URL"" - This is a list of stocks to watch, which is generally positive because it suggests potential growth.
12. ""stocks you migh want to sell $ nati $ bbt $ efx $ amzn wealthmanagement URL"" - The mention of selling suggests the user is looking for undervalued stocks, which could be negative if they're overpriced and might decrease in value.
13. Similar to tweet 5, another query about stock strategies.
14. ""todays stocks you should be watching $ grmn $ fdo $ fcs $ amzn view now URL"" - Another list of stocks to watch, so positive again.
15. Similar to tweet 12, suggesting selling undervalued stocks.
16. Similar to tweet 13, another query about stock strategies.
17. ""alibaba group holding ltd ( nyse : baba ) vs URL inc . ( nasdaq : amzn ... $ amzn URL"" - This seems like comparing two companies, Alibaba and Inc., against Amazon. This could indicate that the user is looking at company performance or stock comparisons, which might be neutral because it's about relative performance.
18. ""$ ups awesome stock research $ mcd $ cme $ amzn worth a look URL"" - Here, the user is suggesting they do stock research for MCD (mcd) and CME (cme). This could be positive as it implies potential growth or value.
19. ""are you thinking of selling $ thrx $ sdrl $ cvd $ amzn investing URL"" - The query about selling shares inThrX, SDRL, CVD, and AMZN. Selling stocks can be negative if they're undervalued but may also depend on the stock price movement.
20. Similar to tweet 19, another query.

Now, compiling all these thoughts: 

- There are several positive tweets (tweets 8, 11, 14, 15, etc.), some about stock strategies and analysts suggesting performance, others just general queries.
- Some negative tweets include selling suggestions (tweets 12, 19), which could be seen as negative if the user is hoping to sell undervalued stocks, but it depends on market conditions.
- There are neutral tweets (2,5,6,7,9,13,16, etc.), indicating no clear sentiment.
- A few more positive mentions of stock comparisons and analysts' opinions.

Overall, while there are some negative tweets suggesting selling undervalued stocks, the majority of the tweets support stock performance or analysis. The overall sentiment is a mix of positive, mostly from analysts and general queries, with minor negative ones about selling. Therefore, it seems the impact might be neutral because the trend isn't overwhelmingly positive; there's also some concern over stock price movement."
2014-12-07,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze the impact on the stock price of a company based on the provided tweets. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock from each tweet. 

1. **$ axs $ fcs $ cof $ amzn economy URL**: The stock symbol is AmZN, which is Amazon.
2. **$ lpla $ btu $ stj $ amzn money URL**: Stock symbol is AMZ.
3. **rt AT_USER stock analyst finds best options strategies $ aapl $ baba $ amzn $ fnma URL**: Stock symbols are APL, BABA, and AMZN.
4. **rt AT_USER stock analyst finds best options strategies $ aapl $ baba $ amzn $ fnma URL**: Same as tweet 3.
5. **looking for the next $ abbv $ ncr $ mmm $ amzn moneymanagement URL**: Stock symbol is AMZN.
6. **rt AT_USER stock analyst finds best options strategies $ aapl $ baba $ amzn $ fnma URL**: Again, AMZ.

So all tweets mention AmZN or other tech stocks like AWS, Facebook, and Amazon. Now, let's break down each tweet into positive and negative factors.

1. Tweet 1: ""stocks i'm keeping my eye on ... should you ? $ axs $ fcs $ cof $ amzn economy URL"" – Positive factors include monitoring stock performance. Negative factor is asking for investment advice.
2. Tweet 2: ""are you thinking of investing in $ lpla $ btu $ stj $ am zn money url"" – Positive: investment suggestions. Negative: no mention of bad things.
3. Tweet 3: ""rt AT_USER stock analyst finds best options strategies $ aapl $ baba $ amzn $ fnma URL"" – Both positive and negative factors as the tweet is ambiguous in its sentiment.
4. Tweet 4: Same as tweet 3, so same analysis applies.
5. Tweet 5: ""looking for the next $ abbv $ ncr $ mmm $ am zn money management url"" – Positive factors include monitoring stock performance. Negative factor is asking about investment advice.
6. Tweet 6: Same as tweet 1 and 2.

Now, assessing sentiment from each tweet:

1. Neutral: Positive factors (stock monitoring) outweigh negative factors (asking for advice).
2. Neutral: Positive factors with no negatives.
3. Neutral: Ambiguous information; both positive and negative factors considered neutral.
4. Neutral: Same as tweet 3.
5. Neutral: Similar to tweets 1, 2, and 5.
6. Neutral: Like the others.

Since all tweets mention AmZN or similar stocks but vary in their sentiment towards investment advice (positive), with no clear positive or negative factors mentioned, the overall sentiment appears neutral. The ambiguity in tweet 3 is causing some uncertainty, but since it's not overwhelmingly positive or negative, it leans towards neutrality."
2014-12-08,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let's start by looking at each tweet individually and identifying any positive or negative factors.

Looking through the list, most tweets are repetitive with similar content about the top stocks like Apple, Amazon, etc., mentioning things like analysts picking picks, options strategies, cyber monday and black friday winners. They sometimes mention specific companies but don't give detailed information. 

Some tweets have more context, like a price target for a stock, which might indicate investor interest or expectation. Others are speculative, talking about premium services or trading platforms.

Since all the tweets are mostly informational without any actual news or positive statements about the company's performance or other factors, it seems neutral overall."
2014-12-09,Negative,"Okay, so I need to determine the overall impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price based on the given rules. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. Identify the Target Stock: The main stock mentioned is AMZN.
2. Tweet-by-Tweet Analysis:
   - Tweets 1-4 mention ""drone research abroad,"" which I don't recognize as positive or negative about AMZN's future performance. They seem neutral but might have some context from AT_USER suggesting concerns, so maybe slightly negative in sentiment.
   - Tweets 5 and 6 talk about AT_USER picking top stock analyst pick lists details and the company buying up shares they bought into yesterday. That sounds like a positive action for AMZN because it's showing a strategic move to increase their position.
   - Tweets 7 mentions Barrick Gold, which is in gold mining. I don't see any specific positive or negative info here.
   - Tweets 8 and 10 talk about Amazon making faster deliveries by bike and drone. This could be seen as a strategic advantage, implying potential growth, so that's positive.
   - Tweets 9-26 mostly mention different stocks like kite, incy, etc., but none specifically target AMZN. It seems more about other companies' strategies or research.

3. Overall Sentiment Summary:
   - Many tweets suggest Amazon expanding into new markets, which could be a good sign for future performance.
   - Some tweets indicate strategic purchases by analysts or companies like Barrick, which might create buy pressure on AMZN.
   - The majority of the tweets don't directly mention AMZN's stock but focus on other companies and their strategies.

Considering all these factors—strategic investments in other sectors, potential expansion into new technologies—AMZN's stock seems likely to have a positive impact. Therefore, the overall sentiment should be [Positive]."
2014-12-10,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. **Amazon's new ""make an offer"" feature** - This seems like a strategic move to make deals online, which could affect pricing strategies.
2. **Researching several stocks** - Investing in these companies might influence investor sentiment if they are undervalued or have good growth prospects.
3. **Amazon's moment of truth may have arrived** - This suggests that Amazon has become competitive enough to outperform competitors.
4. **Selling certain stocks for investment purposes** - Selling could push the company towards more profitable investments.
5. **Losing money on specific stock prices** - If these stocks are undervalued, selling might lead to losses.
6. **Top analyst picks and stock options** - Analysts' recommendations can reflect investor sentiment; if positive, it's good.
7. **Amazon threatening eBay** - A threat could deter competitors, affecting Amazon's market share.
8. **More top analyst details** - Similar to tweet 12, which mentions Fibonacci levels for AMZN and others.
9. **Top stock analyst pick list again** - More confirmation of analyst sentiment, indicating investor confidence.
10. **Investing in top stocks**
11. ** volatile stock prices with percentage changes**
    - VGGL at 3.43 down by 7%, CTIC up but GDXJ unclear
    - AmZN's price remains stable
    - GTC is ambiguous, GDXJ possibly affected.
12. **Investing in different stocks**
13. **Pro company threatening eBay**
14. **Top analyst details again**
15. **Yelling in a crowded store?** (This seems unrelated to stock movements)
16. **More analyst picks and tech stocks**
17. **Top options analyst details**
18. **More top analyst picks**
19. **More analyst picks, same stocks**
20. **Researching penny stock on different companies**
21. **Investing in Apple, Amazon, and others**
    - Why hasn't Apple released a new TV? Could affect Amazon's product offerings.
22. **Fibonacci levels for AMZN and competitors**
    - Technical analysis could influence stock price movements.
23. **Top options picks again**
24. **Options picks again**
25. ** analyst pick list again**

Now, evaluating the sentiment:

- Tweets 18 and 19 mention top analyst details, which are strong indicators of positive sentiment as they reflect investor confidence.
- Most tweets point towards Amazon making strategic moves (like ""make an offer""), which can drive market sentiment. However, tweet 25 mentions selling stocks for investment purposes, which might lead to loss if these stocks are undervalued.
- Technical analysis in tweets 16 and 22 could influence stock prices, but without specific data, it's hard to gauge the impact on the price.
- The negative factor is Apple not releasing new TV content. If Amazon wants to compete with Apple, this could be a negative point if they're already prioritizing their own technology.

Considering all factors, Amazon might see some positive sentiment from strategic moves but also has an opportunity or risk depending on how their product offerings are handled by competitors."
2014-12-11,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their likely impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided a list of 10 tweets, and each is in RT format. My task is to figure out if they're positive, neutral, or negative by evaluating each tweet's sentiment.

First, I'll extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Let me go through them one by one:

1. The first tweet mentions NYSE, DJIA, and several stocks like APEL, FB, AMZN, PCLN, LULU, etc., along with various financial metrics.
2. The second tweet talks about Amazon's stock moving up more than half of the short positions and swinging into a stop at entry.
3. Third tweet is in Chinese, mentioning Facebook, Amazon, and Apple visiting a Chinese company.
4. Fourth tweet discusses Amazon's job posting indicating global ambitions for same-day delivery.
5. Fifth tweet offers research on stocks like VEL, DHI, DE, AMZN.
6. Sixth tweet talks about preparing for afternoon trades with companies AAPL, FB, AMZN, TSLA.
7. Seventh tweet is unclear, mentioning WDC, REL, XEL and Amazon's NASDAQ.
8. Eighth and ninth tweets mention AWS, Tesla (TLM) to a stock chart for AMZN and another company.
9. Similar to the first tweet with more stocks.
10. Twelfth tweet lists PSU, AEE, CME and mentions AMZN.

Now, I need to assess each tweet's sentiment towards the target stock. Since multiple tweets are about Amazon (AMZN), my focus should be on that. Let's break it down:

- Tweet 2: Says more than half of short positions swing into a stop. This is positive because it suggests increased risk management, which might improve market conditions.
- Tweet 4: Amazon's job posting indicates global ambitions for same-day delivery, which could boost the stock.
- Tweets 5 and 10 are about research and trading strategies, not directly related to AMZN.
- Tweets 6 and 7 don't mention AMZN, so they might be more general or unrelated.

Considering these, the tweets suggest that Amazon is performing well and has positive signs of growth. Therefore, overall sentiment seems positive for AMZN stock."
2014-12-12,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the likely impact on the stock price of the company based on these tweets. Let me start by reading through each tweet carefully.

Looking at the first few tweets, they all say something like ""rt AT_USER top stock analyst pick list details $ aapl $ amzn $ baba $ msft $ ebay $ tgt $ sbux URL"" and others with similar content. These seem to be links or mentions of specific stocks. 

I notice that each tweet is just repeating the same phrase, which might not give much context about the company or its stock. Since they're all in quotes and don't mention anything specific about the company, it's hard to determine if these tweets are related to the stock being analyzed.

The user wants me to analyze these tweets to see their impact on the stock price. The process is broken down into steps: identifying the target stock symbol, analyzing each tweet for positive or negative factors, assessing sentiment, and then combining those assessments.

But in this case, there's no mention of any specific company. So it's difficult to extract a target stock symbol from these tweets. They might be referring to multiple companies without context, making it hard to figure out the exact impact on any single stock.

However, even without knowing which stocks are being referred to, each tweet just adds more information about potential future analyst picks or options picking. It seems like users are expressing their opinion that they recommend certain stocks for option trading.

Since none of these tweets provide specific financial data, news, or analysis about the target company, it's challenging to evaluate whether this will positively or negatively affect its stock price. They're just sharing their opinions and thoughts on investing in certain stocks.

Therefore, without any concrete information about the company or its performance, I can't assess the impact on the stock price. The sentiment is pretty vague here, so it's hard to classify as positive, neutral, or negative."
2014-12-13,Positive,"Okay, I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of the given company. Let me start by looking at each tweet carefully.

The first tweet says: ""rt AT_USER nyse dow_jones $ aapl $ goog $ fb $ amzn $ pcln عقد للأسبوع القادم $ lulu 55 call op : 58 cent السهم في طور تكوين رايه."" It translates to something like, ""I just saw this info: the NYSE and Dow Jones values are changing. The stock prices for Aplyx, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Pcln... they're expecting the stock price to go up 58 cents next week."" Hmm, that's quite a statement.

Now, I'll break down each part. The user mentions ""rt"" which might be an abbreviation or typo; maybe it stands for something else, but I'm not sure. Next, nyse and dow_jones are stock ticker symbols, so those values being dynamic suggests the company is monitoring their performance. Then there's a mention of Aplyx, Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Pcln... which I can't identify as stocks; maybe they're referring to other entities? The tweet says ""ال quadratic"" at the end, but that doesn't seem related.

The next part is about expecting a stock price increase by 58 cents. That sounds positive because an upward movement in stock prices generally indicates confidence or expectation of growth, which can lead to higher-priced stocks. But wait, I should check if this tweet could be about something else. Maybe it's about upcoming earnings? The phrase ""ال quadratic"" at the end doesn't seem to fit.

Now, for the second tweet: ""rt AT_USER nyse dow_jones $ aapl $ goog $ fb $ amzn $ pcln عقد للأسبوع的伟大 $ lulu 55 call op : 58 cent السهم في طور تكوين رايه."" It's identical in content but slightly phrased differently. The ""ال quadratic"" again, which might be referring to something else.

So both tweets are about stock prices and expectations for a 58-cent increase next week. They don't mention anything negative or neutral; they're all positive-looking statements with expectations of growth. Therefore, the overall sentiment is positive because each tweet is reinforcing the idea that the stock price will rise."
2014-12-14,Negative,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to figure out if they'll affect the stock price positively, neutrally, or negatively for the given company. The user provided two tweets and a list of stocks in the first tweet. 

Let me start by looking at each tweet one by one.

The first tweet is ""rt AT_USER top stock analyst pick list details $ aapl $ amzn $ baba $ msft $ ebay $ tgt $ sbux URL"". Hmm, this seems like an announcement from AT_USER about picking stocks, listing their URLs. It looks like it's just setting up the names of the stocks without giving any specific information or analysis. Maybe it's promoting a stock pick or giving away stock details.

The second tweet is ""makeanoffer : amazon's game-changing move to keep prices low : URL via AT_USER $ amzn $ ebay"". Here, AT_USER seems to be addressing Amazon by saying they're considering a move that keeps their prices low. That sounds like a suggestion to customers, implying that the stock might decline because of this strategy.

So, breaking it down: The first tweet is about promoting some stocks and giving URLs without much detail on them. It's probably not providing any significant information or analysis. It might be used more as a call for action or an announcement rather than influencing investor sentiment directly.

The second tweet specifically mentions Amazon, which makes me think this could impact the stock price. The mention of a move to keep prices low suggests that Amazon might face some challenges. Investors often look at things like earnings reports, competitive pressures, product launches, etc., as indicators of future performance. If this ""game-changing"" move by Amazon is expected or if it's anticipated to cause issues, that could lead to negative sentiment.

Now, considering both tweets together: The first one isn't providing much; the second one suggests a potential downside for Amazon. So overall, the information given points towards a possible negative impact on the stock price because the tweet directly mentions Amazon and its move which might reduce demand or profitability."
2014-12-15,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact on Amazon's stock price based on these tweets. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, for each tweet, I need to identify if there are positive or negative factors. Then, evaluate their sentiment and combine them to get an overall feeling about whether the stock is going up, staying flat, or down.

Starting with the first tweet: ""$ amzn hbo go now on amazon fire tv"". Hmm, this seems a bit unclear. It mentions Amazon and HBO, which is a streaming service, but it's not clear if that relates to Amazon's operations. Maybe there's confusion here. I'll note it as mixed.

Next, ""amazon fire tv gains hbo go streaming $ amzn URL."" This looks like a link to Amazon's Fire TV product, which has been popularizing. It also mentions HBO and YouTube. So this seems positive because Amazon is investing in new products or services that align with their brand. I'll mark this as Positive.

Third tweet: ""$ stocks you might want to buy $ jbht $ cck $ nsr $ amzn newsletter URL."" This looks like a call for investment. The mention of buying stocks and getting a newsletter suggests positive action from the user, implying potential for higher stock prices. So another Positive.

Fourth tweet: ""sentishiftdown $ goog $ kbh $ fb $ lulu $ pcln $ usd $ bbry $ adbe $ ign $ amzn quantheta sentiquant 05:00 : 06:757."" The word 'sentishiftdown' is a typo, but the rest seems to include stock names and some numbers. It doesn't mention anything about Amazon's performance; it looks more like something else. So this might be Neutral or Negative, depending on context.

Fifth tweet: ""$ hfc whats going on with $ tap $ thc $ amzn visit URL."" This is all about what's happening with people visiting their accounts and mentions ""whats going on with"" things like HFC, Tap, Thc. It seems unrelated to Amazon stock. So this might be Neutral.

Sixth tweet: ""rt AT_USER top stock options analyst details picks $ aapl $ amzn $ baba $ msft $ ebay $ tgt URL."" This is a call for investment again. The user is suggesting buying stocks that Amazon holds and others like Apple, Microsoft, etc. This could indicate positive sentiment as more people are investing in their future. So Positive.

Seventh tweet: ""rt AT_USER top stock options analyst details picks $ aapl $ amzn $ baba $ msft $ ebay $ tgt URL."" Same pattern as the previous one, reinforcing investment calls. Another Positive.

Eighth tweet: ""rt AT_USER top stock options analyst details picks $ aapl $ amzn $ baba $ msft $ ebay $ tgt URL."" Again, same action. So another Positive.

Ninth tweet: ""rt AT_USER top stock analyst pick list details $ aapl $ am zn $ bey $ tgt $ sbux URL."" The user is listing the top stock analysts for Amazon. This could indicate confidence in Amazon's future and positive market reception. Positive.

Tenth tweet: ""rt AT_USER top stock options analyst details picks $ aapl $ amzn $ baba $ msft $ ebay $ tgt URL."" Same as before, reinforcing the idea that the market is supportive of Amazon. Positive.

Eleventh tweet: ""platinum memberships rose , after 528 % gains on penny stocks , in one month ! big update : URL $ orcl $ yhoo $ amzn"" This seems like a promotional message about platinum members getting higher rates and investing. It's positive because it highlights Amazon's growth potential. Positive.

Twelfth tweet: ""apple : panel in ny looks for electronic books bully in arguments stemming from apple appeal URL $ aapl $ amzn."" This mentions an appeal by Apple regarding their e-books, which could indicate negative sentiment as someone is upset or considering changing positions. So Negative.

Thirteenth tweet: ""rt AT_USER top stock options analyst details picks $ aapl $ amzn $ baba $ msft $ ebay $ tgt URL."" Again, investment calls. Positive.

Fourteenth tweet: ""rt AT_USER top stock analyst pick list details $ aapl $ amzn $ baba $ msft $ ebay $ tgt $ sbux URL."" More analysts are listed, but the focus is on Amazon. So Positive.

Fifteenth tweet: ""rt AT_USER top stock options analyst details picks $ aapl $ amzn $ baba $ msft $ ebay $ tgt URL."" Same as before. Positive.

Now compiling all these, most tweets seem to be positive or neutral. There are a couple that look negative due to Apple's situation with their e-books arguments. But the majority point towards Amazon doing well."
2014-12-16,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me start by breaking down each tweet.

First, step 1 is extracting the target stock symbol from the tweets. Some tweets mention specific companies like APLE (apl), AMZN (amzn), BABA (baba), MSFT (msft), and so on. Others include placeholders or URLs, which I can ignore for now since they don't directly relate to a single company.

Looking at the list, most of them are about stock options pick lists and analyst picks. There are also some that mention broader market indices like NYSE (new York Stock Exchange) and Dow Jones. These could indicate investor sentiment towards certain sectors or companies but might not be specific enough for me to identify the exact stock.

Now, for each relevant tweet, I need to separate factors into positive and negative. From the first 25 tweets, they seem to focus on analyst picks and pick lists, which are important indicators of investor sentiment. For example, tweets with quotes or links might indicate support from analysts, while ones without could be conflicting or less clear.

Next, assessing the sentiment is crucial. I notice some tweets have strong positive language like ""some big names still look weak here"" or ""looking for a flush at some point."" These signals show investor confidence in certain stocks. Others mention broader market performance, such as ""nyse dow_jones ... upcoming tick,"" which might reflect concern about the market moving in their favor.

However, without specific stock information, it's challenging to know exactly which company is being discussed. This could lead to uncertainty because different tweets about similar themes might indicate varying levels of sentiment towards different stocks or sectors.

Overall, while many tweets show positive language and mentions of upcoming ticks in the market, others lack specificity. This mix makes it hard to conclude a clear overall sentiment. However, the presence of multiple positive quotes and mentions of upcoming stock performance could indicate general optimism about market movements that might affect the target company's stock price."
2014-12-17,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about stock prices for Amzn. So, first, I need to go through each tweet and see what they're saying. 

Looking at the tweets from 1 to 5, all of them have words like ""top stock options analyst guru"" or ""analyzes options market."" These seem to be talking about analyzing the options market, which usually relates to trading strategies, not necessarily the actual price movements. So I think these are Positive but maybe a bit Neutral because they're just providing information without predicting anything specific.

Then there are tweets from 6 to 10 that talk about selling stocks like $glw$ and $vnta$. These are clearly about selling positions or suggesting actions, which might be seen as Negative because it's advising against buying Amzn. However, the context is a bit vague since they don't specify whether these actions will lead to gains.

Tweets 11-15 mention things like liquidity for $bbt$ and $ftr$, or research on specific stocks ($oi$ and $teasa$). These are all informational or technical in nature. They're giving details without predicting the stock price, so I think they contribute a Positive sentiment since they don't suggest an action that would influence the price.

Finally, tweet 16 is about researching something related to Amzn. This could be seen as Neutral because it's just info rather than analysis or prediction.

Putting it all together: most tweets are informative (Positive), but some advise against trading or selling stocks (Negative). But looking at how they're phrased, they might not have enough details to predict a price change. So overall, the sentiment is a mix of Positive and Neutral, which makes me think of [Neutral]."
2014-12-18,Neutral,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to determine the overall impact on the company's stock price based on these tweets. So, I need to analyze each tweet and see what they're saying about the stock options, their performance, and investor sentiment.

First, looking at tweet 1: It mentions $ spx $ spy $ aapl $ amzn URL. That seems like it's related to the S&P 500 (spy) or Amazon (AMZN). I'm not sure what the user is suggesting here—could be a typo or irrelevant info. Maybe nothing significant from this one.

 Tweet 2 talks about $ amzn and mentions ""qr"" which isn't clear, but it also includes ""give it a try."" That might imply that someone suggests investing in Amazon, so perhaps there's some trading advice here. But it's vague, just saying ""give it a try.""

Tweet 3 repeats the same as tweet 1, so I don't think anything new here.

Tweet 4 is about $ hpq $ cnk $ tgi $ amzn financial. This seems like focusing on another stock—maybe HPQ or TGI or CNK. Without more info, it's hard to assess if this relates to AMZN performance or not.

Tweets 5-7 are all similar with information about $ bax $ laz $ dvn $ amzn economy URL and others. This could indicate that someone is monitoring AMZN for economic factors affecting its stock price.

Tweet 8 talks about $ kmi $ hca $ cag $ amzn equity, which again relates to AMZN but from a different angle—maybe focusing on companies like KMI or HCA. It's suggesting looking for the next performance in these sectors.

Tweets 9-13 are similar to tweet 4 and 7: they mention other stocks like TwTR, AMZN going higher, and research suggestions. Again, mostly about stock news but not directly related to AMZN.

Putting this together, all tweets are either discussing various financials (like spy, spx, amzn, bax, hq) or economic factors affecting AMZN. There's a lot of information being shared about different companies, and while some mention AMZN, it's unclear from the context if there's positive, negative, or neutral advice given.

However, looking for trends in each tweet: several are just informational without a clear direction on how to invest. Others suggest monitoring multiple sectors but again, not providing actionable info on AMZN specifically. There's no direct mention of AMZN's performance or any predictive information.

Considering all the tweets focus on different stocks and factors, there doesn't seem to be a consistent positive or negative trend pointing towards AMZN stock price movement. It's more about discussing various market participants and upcoming events rather than providing direct insights into the company itself.

So, I don't think there's enough clear evidence here that would make it positive or negative. The overall sentiment remains Neutral because all tweets are informative without a specific direction on how to interpret them for stock price impact."
2014-12-19,Neutral,"Alright, so I need to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price of Amazon. Let me break down each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet mentions ETFs like S&P 500, SPY, S&P 400, and AMZN. It talks about an analyst's opinion and mentions a URL for research. This seems to be positive because it's analyzing the market trends and suggesting topics related to Amazon.
2. The second tweet is similar but focuses on how things need to improve for Amazon to justify its stock price. It includes an Amazon URL. Again, this is a positive because it's discussing factors that could lead to Amazon being seen fairly.
3. Another tweet repeats the same positive points about market trends and potential improvements in Amazon's conditions.
4. The fourth tweet has a research section with metrics like GFRD and ASHI. It also includes a URL but doesn't mention anything negative, just information for research purposes. This is positive because it's providing useful information without any concerns.
5. The fifth tweet is neutral—it simply asks if Amazon should be considered for research or trading. It's not indicating any favorable or unfavorable stance.
6. Another neutral tweet similar to the fifth one, again asking about Amazon in the context of research and trading.
7. The seventh tweet mentions LII (which I think stands for Lstick Index) and BRK (maybe Best Roundhouse Knights? Or perhaps a typo?), with AMZN as the target stock. It suggests seeing it soon. This is positive because it's talking about a potential upcoming topic or analysis on Amazon.

Looking at all these, most tweets are either providing market analysis, suggesting factors for Amazon to improve, or just offering information without negative cues. There's no indication of negative news or any concerns about Amazon's performance. Therefore, the overall sentiment seems neutral."
2014-12-20,Missing,File not found
2014-12-21,Negative,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze the impact on the stock price for the given tweets about Amazon's (AMZN) stock. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at tweet 1 and the next three. They all mention an analyst who is analyzing options market data, specifically focusing on stocks like SPX, SPY, AAPL, and AMZN. The fact that they're talking about the options market suggests some sentiment towards either bullish or bearish views. However, each tweet doesn't have a specific direction; it just provides a list of stock symbols. Since I don't see any positive or negative language or specifics, it's hard to tell if there's an intent behind these statements.

Then, there are two more tweets. The third one mentions the VIX index and says AMZN is down from $1750 to $423, and it seems like a lot of people are talking about that. That could imply some fear or uncertainty, which might be negative sentiment because higher VIX levels usually indicate nervousness in the market.

The last tweet also brings up AMZN being down and mentions Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR). The combination of such information often shows investor concern, especially since both FB and TWTR have been affected by Elon Musk's decisions around Twitter, which impacted their stock prices. This could be a mix of negative thoughts about Facebook and the broader market.

Putting it all together, while some tweets do mention specific stocks or indices that affect AMZN's performance, they don't provide strong evidence for positive or negative sentiment. The overall environment seems volatile with news related to financial institutions and corporate announcements, which can cause market instability. Therefore, despite the mentions of various factors, there doesn't seem to be a clear dominant positive or negative trend."
2014-12-22,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of a company. Let's start by breaking down the problem step by step.

First, I see that each tweet is about the options market with some specific stocks mentioned like $ spx (S&P 500), $ spy (SPY, which is SPY index), $ aapl ($AAPL Apple) and $ amzn ($AMZN Amazon). Then there are more tweets with different stock symbols. The goal is to assess each tweet's impact on the company's stock price.

Looking at the structure of the problem, I remember that it mentions identifying the target stock from the tweets. Each tweet seems to be related to options analysis, which might influence investor sentiment but doesn't necessarily indicate a direct impact on the stock price unless it's confirming expectations or signaling something about market conditions.

I notice that all the provided tweets are repeating ""rt AT_USER top stock options analyst guru analyzes..."" and have multiple stock symbols. However, each subsequent tweet is the same until the 7th one, which introduces more varied stocks like $ gild (GILD), $ abbv ($ABV) and others from 2014 to a date. The last tweet seems incomplete or contains some formatting issues.

Since all tweets are similar and repeat the same stock symbols without any new information, it's hard to determine the overall sentiment. Each tweet is about analyzing options in the market, which can affect investor confidence but doesn't directly indicate if the price will go up, down, or stay flat.

I should also consider that the user is asking for a single-line conclusion regarding the stock's impact. Given the nature of the tweets and the lack of variation in stocks mentioned, I think it might not be possible to conclusively determine a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment without more context or specific data on how each tweet affects investor behavior.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I'll categorize these tweets as [Neutral] because they don't provide enough details to assess a clear trend. They're all about the same set of stock symbols repeatedly, which doesn't give any indication of market movement or trends beyond what's implied by the options analysis."
2014-12-23,Neutral,"Okay, so I have to figure out how these tweets are affecting the stock price of a company based on their content. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, they all mention $ spx $ spy $ aapl $ amzn URL, which probably refers to some indices or related financial terms like S&P 500 (spx), SPY being a popular ETF for that index, and companies like Amazon, Apple, etc. The repeated mentions of ""options market"" suggest that these tweets are discussing options trading, which is a type of stock trading strategy.

Looking at the factors each tweet raises: in most cases, there's mention of analyst gurus or investors talking about top stocks. For example, on tweet 4 and others, they're talking about analyst gurus who analyze the options market. This could be positive because having well-aware analysts can provide valuable insights into stock performance.

Now, assessing sentiment from each tweet. Most are just repeating previous statements without any new information or strong emotional language. They're all simply stating which stocks are being analyzed and perhaps offering some predictions. There's no indication of confidence, fear, or uncertainty in the message itself.

Since there's no explicit positive or negative language used—just general statements about analyst opinions and stock analysis—it seems like these tweets don't carry enough weight to sway investor sentiment. They're more of a factual update without any emotional or conclusive message.

So putting it all together, each tweet is contributing to the discussion but isn't strong enough on their own. Without additional context or contradictory viewpoints, it's hard to tell if they're reinforcing, conflicting, or neutral in terms of stock price impact."
2014-12-24,Negative,"Alright, I need to determine the likely impact on Amazon's stock price based on these tweets. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually.

The first tweet explains to my dad how Amazon never makes a profit and mentions that Bezos was fired up. That sounds negative. It seems like Amazon isn't performing well financially, which could hurt their stock value.

The second tweet talks about receiving a refund after switching from SD to HD on Amazon's instant video service, which is supposed to widen their moat. This is positive because it's showing improvement and expanding their competitive position. Widening the moat generally means they're taking steps to protect themselves from competitors, which can be seen as a good sign for future performance.

So combining these two factors: one tweet is negative about Amazon's profitability, while another is positive about improving their video service. Both seem like they could influence investor sentiment positively because the second tweet shows improvement. The first tweet is more about his dad and Amazon's financial health, which are outside my direct analysis but still relevant to overall stock performance.

I'm leaning towards a positive overall impact because there's some indication of expansion into new services (HD videos) and improved customer support (the refund), which can boost confidence in their future performance. But the first tweet is more of a personal commentary that might not have as strong a direct effect on Amazon's financial health."
2014-12-25,Negative,"Alright, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol. The tweets mention ""amzn"" and ""wfm"", so the stock is probably Amazon Inc., specifically ""Amazon.com"".

Now, analyzing each tweet individually. The first tweet says ""$ nugt short sales updated thursday , december 25 , 2014 5:03 : 36 pm $ amzn $ btu $ sdrl $ cost URL"". That seems to be a typo or irrelevant information about short sales and costs, which are financial metrics. They likely don't impact Amazon's stock price significantly because they pertain more to operational aspects rather than earnings or market sentiment.

The second tweet is ""$ amzn stock price updated thursday , december 25 , 2014 09:11 : 57 am $ wfm $ uup $ cost $ cat URL"". This seems to be a financial update about Amazon's stock price. The mention of ""wfm"", ""uup"", and ""cost"" could indicate that this is related to the company's performance, maybe their revenue or earnings for the day.

I don't have access to external data sources here, so I can't verify if these updates are positive or negative about Amazon. However, since both tweets mention ""amzn"" directly, they are likely to be related to Amazon's financials and stock price changes. Without more context or specific information from other sources, it's hard to assess the sentiment of either tweet.

Given that only one tweet is providing direct updates on Amazon's stock price, I can't combine their impact into an overall sentiment for the stock. Each tweet could have its own positive or negative effect based on real-time data, but without additional information, it's challenging to determine the net effect.

I might need more data points from other sources to evaluate the overall sentiment accurately. Since only two tweets are available, I can't make a definitive conclusion about whether they contribute positively, neutrally, or negatively to Amazon's stock price."
2014-12-26,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on Amazon's stock price. I'm not super experienced in predicting stock markets, but I'll take it step by step.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""we got a refund on $ amzn instant video ( switched from sd to hd ) ten minutes after emailing customer service : widening the moat ."" Okay, so Amazon is switching their video streaming service. That seems like an update or change in their product line. They're changing from SD to HD, which I know can be beneficial because HD might offer better content. If that's done, it could open up new opportunities for them and also help reduce their ""moat,"" which is a business advantage that others don't have yet. A wider moat usually means the company has a competitive edge, so a positive sign.

Now, the second tweet: ""rt AT_USER amazon says sixty percent of its shoppers this season bought on mobile device . $ amzn AT_USER"" This one mentions a statement from Amazon's customer service team. They're saying that 60% of their customers are using mobile devices for shopping this season. That sounds like strong sales data because more people are choosing online, which is growing increasingly important. More online shoppers can boost revenue and growth potential.

So, putting these together: The first tweet shows Amazon making an operational change to improve their product line and reduce their moat. That's positive. The second tweet gives real-world data on customer satisfaction with mobile usage, which also supports a positive outlook. Both factors seem to be good for the stock price because they show growth potential, improved positioning in the market, and measurable performance.

I don't see any negative information here. The tweets are talking about improvements or data that support Amazon's business goals and could lead to better revenue and customer satisfaction. Therefore, it looks like there's a positive trend."
2014-12-27,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of the company in question. Let me start by understanding what each tweet is saying and how it might influence investor sentiment.

The first tweet mentions that ""stocks with notable buzz on social media are a good investment."" That seems like positive because it's suggesting something, so I'll mark this as Positive.

The next couple of tweets offer a next pick or a discount. They don't explicitly state a strong expectation about the stock performance but instead suggest getting more stocks. These signals can indicate increasing interest and possibly better prospects, so they might contribute to a positive overall sentiment.

Then there are several tweets from AT_USER analyst reports on 2015 stock options. Each one seems repetitive with similar content. Analysts updating filing times are usually positive because it shows that market participants are keeping an eye on the company's performance and possibly planning for future investments. More such reports can indicate confidence in the company, which is a good sign.

Looking at the remaining tweets, they're all repeating the same content about analyst reports. This repetition might be redundant but could still contribute to positive sentiment as it's consistent with investor behavior pointing towards growth.

Putting this together: There are 12 tweets here. The first one is definitely Positive because it offers a good investment opportunity. The next few suggest interest and potential gains, which can boost expectations. The analyst reports further boost the positive outlook by signaling confidence in future developments. Even though there's repetition, it reinforces these positive factors without introducing any negative or neutral elements.

Therefore, considering all these points, each tweet is reinforcing the positive sentiment about the stock."
2014-12-28,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. I'm given three tweets and need to figure out if they're positive, neutral, or negative.

First, looking at each tweet one by one. The first tweet says ""weekly wrap-up : ba , hes , gild , pcln , amzn , gpro , pcln , cmg , rl $ ba $ hes $ gild $ pcln $ amzn $ gpro $ cmg $ rl $ amgn $ spx URL."" Hmm, it seems like this is a weekly summary of the stock market, mentioning several companies. It doesn't look negative or positive; it's more about the current state of the markets. So maybe this tweet isn't very impactful on sentiment.

The second tweet reads ""rt AT_USER hackers leak passwords , credit card numbers of 13,000 playstation , xbox , amazon users . URL $ amzn $ msft …"". This one mentions that hackers are leaking credentials and users on PS4 and Xbox. I know that hacking activities can be negative because they disrupt operations and can lead to security issues. That could potentially decrease investor confidence, making sentiment negative.

The third tweet is ""rt AT_USER analyst report on top stock market options for 2015 read here $ aapl $ amzn $ baba $ ebay URL."" This seems more positive as it's about providing market analysis and financial info. It might be seen as encouraging investors or improving their decision-making, so this could contribute to a positive sentiment.

Putting this together: The first tweet is neutral because it just updates the markets without any news of good or bad. The second is negative due to increased hacking threats. The third is positive with analyst reports. But since I need a single overall sentiment based on all tweets, perhaps they are mixed but leaning towards positive because of the positive report and less impact from the negative."
2014-12-29,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price. So, first, I need to look at each tweet and see what it's saying.

Looking through the tweets, they all start with ""rt AT_USER analyst report on top stock market options for 2015 read here $ aapl $ amzn $ baba $ ebay URL."" That means they're providing an analysis of stock market options in 2015. I wonder what that entails. Maybe it's talking about future trends, stock performance metrics, or some financial outlook.

The user ID is AT_USER, so presumably they're real users contributing to the analysis. Each tweet seems repetitive with the same phrase, which might indicate a consistent theme. Since all tweets are quoting the same report, there's no variation in content from one to another, making it hard to identify specific factors like positive or negative.

Now, the second part of each tweet is about market options on companies like Apple (Aapl), Amazon (Amzn), Beta (Baba), and Yahoo (Yelp). The quotes mention various metrics and possibly future expectations for these stocks. For example, ""rocking URL"" could be a typo, but it might mean something like the stock is expected to perform well in the future.

I need to assess how each tweet affects investor sentiment. Since all are reporting on 2015 market options, which is a specific and fixed time frame, I'm not sure if this gives any indication of long-term trends or future performance beyond 2015. It might be pointing towards current market conditions but not necessarily affecting the stock price in the near term.

Considering that all tweets are quoting the same report without providing additional info, it's challenging to determine if there's a positive or negative factor. The lack of variability makes me lean toward neutral because each tweet doesn't show any divergence in sentiment; they're just repeating the same content.

Putting this together, since the information is static and from 2015, without any indication of improving or worsening market conditions, it seems like there's no clear positive or negative impact. Therefore, a neutral conclusion makes sense here."
2014-12-30,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on a company's stock price and decide whether it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

The first tweet is ""rt AT_USER analyst report on top stock market options for 2015 read here $ aapl $ amzn $ baba $ ebay URL."" It looks like the user is reporting an analyst opinion and providing stock symbols. This seems more about information than sentiment, so I don't think it directly affects investor sentiment.

The second tweet is ""rt AT_USER analyst report on top stock market options for 2015 read here $ aapl $ amzn $ baba $ ebay URL."" Similar to the first one, it's another report, but mentions a buy signal and resistance levels. It doesn't sound like a positive or negative opinion; more like confirming information.

The third tweet is ""AT_USER $ amzn given $ 400 pt by piper jaffray - - buy rating ."" This seems to be a specific action from an analyst, giving Amzn a buy recommendation at $400. While this is a statement from an expert, it's more about confirming previous information and doesn't convey positive or negative sentiment.

The fourth tweet repeats the same report as before but again gives a stock symbol. Like the first tweet, it's informational without any positive or negative language.

The fifth tweet is another repeat of the initial report. No new info here either; just reaffirming the analyst opinion.

Now, considering all these tweets, they are all about providing information and confirming previous reports rather than expressing positive, neutral, or negative opinions. They don't have any strong statements that would suggest a clear trend in sentiment towards the stock price."
2014-12-31,Neutral,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price for a company. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. But looking at the tweets provided, they all mention Apple (Aapl), Amazon (Amzn), BABA (Baba), and Yell (Ebay). Hmm, not sure which one is being referred to here because multiple are mentioned. Maybe each tweet is about a different stock? That could complicate things.

Each tweet has several factors listed: $ aapl, $ amzn, $ baba, $ ebay. It seems like they're all listing prices or market options related to these companies. 

Now, for each tweet, I need to separate the Positive and Negative factors. But in this case, every single tweet is just repeating the same list of factors without any mention of sentiment. So, it's pretty uniform across the tweets.

The user also provided a way to analyze the impact: identify the stock symbol, then go through each tweet one by one. For each tweet, separate the factors into positive and negative, assess the sentiment from the tweet content, and combine them for the overall summary.

But in this case, all the tweets don't have any positive or negative labels on their content; they just list prices and options. So it's challenging to determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative because there's no explicit sentiment expressed.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Each tweet is a report about market options for 2015, but without specific quotes or comments from analysts indicating their sentiment towards the stock, it's hard to assign a positive or negative label.

Also, the fact that each tweet is repeating the same content suggests that there's no new information being provided, so I can't assess any change in sentiment beyond what might be inferred from the content itself. Since all the tweets are just listing factors without any specific claims or opinions, it's not clear if they're positive or negative.

Therefore, considering all this, perhaps each tweet is neutral because there's no indication of either a favorable or unfavorable opinion about the stock symbol being mentioned. There's no explicit information that suggests positivity or negativity."
2015-01-01,Negative,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on a company's stock price. The user provided some specific steps and an example output, which should help me structure my thinking.

First, I need to extract the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the tweets, I see mentions of ""apl,"" ""amzn,"" ""baba,"" and ""ebay."" Hmm, these are stock symbols. But I'm not sure which one is the actual target company. Maybe it's a typo or maybe they're referring to different companies. For now, I'll assume that each tweet is about ""Amazon"" since amzn is their symbol. But there's also mentions of 3D Systems and another company called ""ddd,"" but I'm not sure if that's relevant.

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. Let me go through them one by one:

1. The first tweet says the analyst report on top stock options is available, but it doesn't mention any positive or negative info about Amazon or other companies.
2. Similarly, tweets 2-4 are just repeating the same report without any specific details about Amazon's performance.
3-5: Same thing; just the report.
6 and 7: Again, repeating the report without any impact on the stock price.
8: Repeating the report as well.

Then there are two more tweets:

9. 3D systems and Amazon expect their stock to rebound in 2015, with a URL pointing to ddd for 3D Systems.
10. Jeff Bezos lost $7.4 billion in Amazon's worst year since 2008, as per the report.

Wait, so tweet 10 specifically mentions Jeff Bezos losing money at Amazon. That sounds negative because losing significant profits can impact investor sentiment negatively. But I need to check if that's the only mention of Jeff Bezos' loss.

Also, tweet 9 is about 3D Systems and Amazon rebounding in 2015, which might be positive for Amazon but maybe not directly related to their stock performance unless it affects other companies.

I also notice that there are multiple mentions of "" momentarily"" or ""just now,"" which could imply that information arrived quickly. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Looking at the output requirement, I need to conclude with ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]."" Since tweet 10 is the only one specifically about Jeff Bezos losing money in Amazon and it's part of a broader report, this could be seen as negative because it directly affects Amazon's financial performance. However, if other tweets aren't providing positive info about Amazon's stock market options or future prospects, maybe there's some neutral impact.

But wait, the user provided an example output where it was classified as ""[Negative]"" for tweet 10 and another mention of Jeff Bezos losing money. So perhaps the overall sentiment is negative because of that loss.

Alternatively, if other tweets don't provide positive info but just reports, maybe there's a neutral impact because the only negative factor is the loss in profits. Or it could be considered positive because the report provides insight into Amazon's future options. But generally, financial losses are seen as negative for investors.

So I think the overall sentiment would be ""[Negative]"" because Jeff Bezos' loss of significant profits is a direct and significant negative impact on Amazon."
2015-01-02,Negative,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. The user has given me 19 tweets and wants me to determine if each is positive, neutral, or negative regarding their stock. 

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking through the tweets, it seems they all mention ""amzn,"" which is Amazon Inc. (AMZN). So, the stock in question is Amazon.

Next, for each tweet, I should separate positive and negative factors. Positive factors might include things like analyst reports about market options or product updates, while negative could involve discounts, news that hurts investors, or any other concerns.

Then, I have to assess the sentiment of each tweet regarding AMZN's performance. Sentiment is usually determined by how the tweet reflects on the stock price—whether it looks strong, weak, or uncertain.

Looking at the tweets:

1.rt AT_USER analyst report... URL: This seems positive because analysts are giving their opinions.
2. rt AT_USER free delivery ... URL: Positive because they're highlighting a benefit for consumers, which could be seen as good news.
3. Our penny stock picks gained... URL: Positive since the user is promoting gains.
4. rt AT_USER report... URL: Same as tweet 1, positive.
5. rt AT_USER report again... URL: Positive.
6. $ amzn ... URL: The link says ""streaming services premarket,"" which could be a sign of higher demand or investment interest.
7. rt AT_USER report... URL: Positive.
8. rt AT_USER report... URL: Positive.
9. rt AT_USER spy account... URL: Positive because the user is encouraging trading.
10. rt AT_USER account ... URL: Positive.
11. rt AT_USER account ... URL: Positive again.
12. rt AT_USER report... URL: Positive.
13. $ amzn downgraded today URL: Negative, as the stock is being evaluated and might affect investor sentiment.
14. $ amzn in 315 calls URL: This seems like a bearish news because it's related to market conditions or earnings, which can impact stock prices negatively.
15-19. rt AT_USER account ... URL: Positive as they encourage trading.

Now, for each tweet, I'll assess the sentiment towards AMZN:

- Tweets 1,3,4,5: Positive
- Tweets 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13: Mixed or mostly positive except some negative. Wait, tweet 13 says ""downgraded today,"" which is definitely negative.
- Tweets 14 and 15-19: These are all positive because they encourage trading.

So combining all these, the overall sentiment seems to be a mix of positive and slightly negative factors. There are some clear positive tweets about growth and trading encouragement, while one tweet (AMZN downgraded) is a strong negative. The other tweets provide context that could go either way but are generally positive except for the downgrade.

Therefore, considering all these points, it seems like the overall sentiment leans towards mixed but mostly positive with a minor negative event."
2015-01-03,Neutral,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company based on the given information. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the tweet: ""$ bmy $ amzn : stocks to watch : bristol-myers squibb company ( nyse : bmy ... URL URL"". Hmm, the user mentions ""bristol-myers squibb company"" and links it to ""bmy"" with an NYSE. I'm not sure what exact details are included in this link, but I can assume it's a specific stock that the user is mentioning.

I need to extract the target stock symbol. The text says ""$ bmy $ amzn"", which seems like both companies are being referred to here. But since each tweet probably contains information about one company at a time, maybe only one of them is relevant. Maybe ""bmy"" is the actual stock symbol and ""amzn"" is just part of another mention.

The user also mentions it's on the NYSE, so the stock in question must be listed there. I don't have enough context to know which exact company that is, but perhaps the tweet is indicating the stock is something notable or well-known. 

Now, looking at the factors: Positive and Negative. The tweet doesn't mention any positive actions like earnings reports, product launches, or news related to the stock. It also doesn't state any negative thoughts about the stock's performance. Since it's just a link to another company (squibb) that might not be directly related unless there's an assumption here.

Assessing sentiment: The tweet seems neutral because it mentions ""stocks to watch"" without indicating positive or negative expectations. Investors generally have mixed feelings when multiple stocks are linked, but each can influence opinions independently.

Putting it all together, the tweet doesn't provide any clear indicators that would make the stock go up or down. It's not a recommendation or worst-case scenario. So, the overall sentiment is neutral."
2015-01-04,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Hmm, so I'm given four tweets, each with some details about factors like reviews, company news, etc.

Starting with the first tweet: "" $ amzn reviews updated sunday , january 4 , 2015 09:02 : 55 am $ jaso $ crm $ iwm $ dd URL"" – this seems to be a review update about Amazon. It mentions things like free delivery and customer feedback, which are positive signs for a company because positive reviews can attract more customers. So that's a good sign.

Moving on to the second tweet: "" fedex , ups recalculate , raise rates URL via AT_USER $ ups $ fdx $ amzn"" – this looks like FedEx is recalling their product and increasing their rate. That seems like bad news for Amazon, especially if Fedex isn't a major competitor or a reliable provider in the retail sector.

The third tweet: "" $ amzn $ wmt $ tgt $ bby news : "" the free delivery gambit in retail $ amzn $ wmt $ tgt … "" URL board view : URL – this mentions free delivery as a gamble. While that could be seen as an idea or potential for success, it's not something Amazon is actively promoting right now. I'm not sure if ""gamble"" would really impact stock performance unless there are specific company plans to execute on the gamble.

The fourth tweet: "" amazon chief jeffbezos lost $ 7.4 b in company ’ s worst year URL $ amzn ecommerce nasdaq sp500 URL"" – Jeffery Bezos losing $7.4 billion in his third-best-performing year suggests a tough financial quarter. Losing money can impact investor sentiment, especially if it's a significant loss. However, Amazon has shown resilience and positive growth trends, so the drop might not be as negative as expected.

Now, putting this all together: The first tweet is positive about reviews. The second is clearly bad for Amazon. The third seems speculative but maybe not impactful yet. The fourth shows a significant financial loss, which could lead to some investors feeling uncertain or worried about the company's future performance.

So overall, there are conflicting signals here—some good news and some negative news. The positive tweet adds value, but then there's a big issue that might turn it around. I'm leaning towards an ambiguous overall sentiment because while the positive note is present, the major events could tip the balance either way."
2015-01-05,Neutral,"Alright, let's break down how I approached analyzing the tweets to determine their impact on Amazon's stock price.

First, I identified the target stock symbol from each tweet. The first tweet mentions ""amazon ’ s third-party sellers shipped 2 billion units in 2014 , double the 2013 figure."" The key piece here is ""2 billion units,"" which points me towards Amazon as the company. So, the target stock is Amazon.

Next, I looked at each tweet to separate positive and negative factors. In this case, there's only one tweet, so both Positive and Negative are somewhat neutral because it doesn't provide multiple options or clear information.

Then, I evaluated the sentiment of each relevant tweet. The tweet talks about a significant increase in third-party seller units shipped, which could indicate growth in demand for Amazon's products or services. This suggests positive trends, but since there aren't any negative factors mentioned, the impact is likely neutral because it's based on one piece of information without conflicting viewpoints.

I considered how this data could affect investor sentiment. While it reflects Amazon's performance positively, there might be other factors like market competition, economic conditions, or company-specific news that aren't captured in a single tweet. Without more context or multiple tweets analyzing the same point, I can't determine if there are underlying negative implications.

Since the tweet only presents one piece of information without any conflicting evidence, and all the data points are in line with positive trends, the overall sentiment is neutral."
2015-01-06,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet one by one and see what they're suggesting.

First tweet is about AMZN upping its fight with Netflix with 13 new original series. That sounds like a positive because it's a strategic move that could increase sales or market share. So, this is likely to be a positive factor for Amazon.

Second tweet mentions $ amzn chart added to short. I'm not entirely sure about this one. Adding something to the short position could mean selling the stock or considering it as a risk, which might affect investor sentiment. It's a bit unclear without more context, but it's probably part of the overall view.

Third tweet suggests watching danrocks because AMZN is involved with them. Danrock is the company's competitor, so this seems like a positive sign that their products or services are being watched closely. This could boost investor confidence.

Fourth tweet talks about third-party sellers shipping 2 billion units in 2014, double of 2013. This indicates a significant increase in sales volume, which is positive for the company's revenue and growth prospects. Definitely a positive point.

Fifth tweet mentions string of labs paid by AMZN shareholders. While I'm not sure about the specifics, this could mean that they're expanding or investing more in research and development, which usually benefits the company. So, this adds to the optimistic outlook.

Sixth tweet includes $ qld on radar with several other stocks: uup, hyg, myec, amzn, goog. These are all companies in tech, including Amazon. The mention of AMZN suggests that it's being monitored or considered for investment by others. This could indicate strong fundamentals and increasing investor interest, which is positive.

Putting this all together, each tweet contributes to a favorable view of AMZN, especially with increased sales, investments, and monitoring. I don't see any negative signs here. So, the overall sentiment should be positive."
2015-01-07,Neutral,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. The user provided 31 tweets, each in English, and they all mention $ googl, $ goog, $ yhoo, and $ amzn. These are all major tech companies: Google, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook (through YHOO). 

Looking at the first tweet, it says that the weakness of $ goog and $ amzn is not surprising since 90s have been over for a long time. That suggests some investor sentiment might be down, but not a clear trend yet. Then, the second tweet mentions three large tech stocks are trading near support levels with Google looking vulnerable to Apple and Amazon. This could mean that investors think Google might suffer if Apple or Amazon gains more, which is common in tech sector valuations.

From tweets 3 to 30, each seems similar, just repeating the same points about the companies and their valuations. They all mention $ amzn as being weak or vulnerable to others. This repetition suggests that investors are not seeing a clear improvement but rather instability in their views on these stocks.

The last tweet is a bit different because it mentions ""last-mile delivery"" in an Indian context, using URLs like ""lastmile"". This could mean that the company is looking for new revenue streams or partnerships with third-party delivery services. However, without specific details about how this relates to the stock price, it's hard to say if this affects the overall sentiment.

Considering all these tweets, they all point towards a possible downward trend in valuations but not necessarily a clear improvement. The repeated mentions of $ amzn as being vulnerable might indicate that investors are concerned about its future performance but don't see immediate positive signs. 

So, putting it together, the overall sentiment is likely [Neutral], because while there's some concern about valuations, there isn't strong evidence for an upward trend or improved investor sentiment."
2015-01-08,Neutral,"Okay, so I have to figure out how these tweets affect Amazon's stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the tweets provided: ""amzn there is 303s as mentioned earlier ... URL"" and "" few stocks up on my watch list $ aapl $ baba $ halo $ lulu $ fold $ pir $ amzn $ cree $ fb"". Hmm, ""amZN"" doesn't make much sense. Maybe it's a typo. I think the main stock here is AMZN because the other words like BABA (beta), HOLOOLUVA, LULU, etc., might be referring to related stocks. So, the target stock is probably Amazon (AMZN).

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet says ""am zn there is 303s as mentioned earlier ... URL"". The word ""URL"" here likely refers to a URL for something related to AMZN. But without more context, it's hard to determine if it's positive or negative. Maybe the mention of something like ""beta"" (BABA) could be a sign, but I'm not sure how that affects Amazon's stock.

2. The second tweet is a list: "" few stocks up on my watch list $ aapl $ baba $ halo $ lulu $ fold $ pir $ amzn $ cree $ fb"". This seems like a promotional offer listing several related stocks. If the user says ""few stocks up,"" that suggests they're buying these stocks, which could indicate positive sentiment towards them.

Now, assessing each tweet's factors:

1. Positive factors: The mention of ""beta"" might mean AMZN is involved in some beta-related investment. This can sometimes increase stock prices if there are underlying trends. So, this tweet has a positive factor.

2. Negative factors: None immediately come to mind here. The listing seems neutral until I consider that it's about other stocks. But since the main target is AMZN, negative factors from other stocks might not directly impact AMZN's price unless they suggest a downturn in AMZN.

Now, overall sentiment summary: There are positive factors like mentioning beta and negative factors related to other stocks. The list seems neutral except for the positive mention of beta. I'm leaning towards ""Neutral"" because while there's some positive information about AMZN through its beta, there isn't overwhelming evidence from other sources."
2015-01-09,Negative,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to figure out how they'll affect the stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at tweet 1: It mentions $ aa news and several stocks like Aapl, Tsla, Amzn, FB, etc., on a URL board view. That's not giving me any specific information about the stock or its performance. So I can't tell much from this one yet.

Tweets 2 to 19 all mention AT_USER talking about Google products and options for Amazon stock priced at $302.50 call options. Each tweet seems similar, just repeating that information in a slightly different way. They're all about the price of an option on Amazon, which doesn't directly relate to the company's stock price.

So, none of these tweets mention any news related to the target stock or its performance. They're all focusing on something else. That makes me think they might not have much impact on the stock price.

Putting it all together, since there's no positive or negative information in these tweets, and nothing that suggests an increase, decrease, or stability in the stock price, I should classify this as [Neutral]. There's no support for a positive, negative, or neutral stance here."
2015-01-10,Positive,"Alright, let's figure out how to assess the impact of these tweets on a stock price. The user provided two specific tweets and wants me to determine if they'll be positive, neutral, or negative in their impact.

First, I need to identify the target stock. In both tweets, ""url"" appears frequently, which doesn't directly give the stock symbol. But looking closely, the terms ""penny stock picks gained over 968 % in 5 weeks"" and ""next pick early"" might indicate a stock like TSLA (TSL; Apple Inc.), as they're known for their penny stocks.

Next, I'll break down each tweet's factors. For the first tweet: It mentions that the penny stock picked up more than 968% over five weeks, which is an explosive gain. The ""url"" seems to be a placeholder, possibly for TSLA or another company. The suggestion to get the next pick early might imply immediate action, but it's more about potential gains rather than negative factors.

For the second tweet: It also talks about penny stocks gaining 968% in five weeks and mentioning the ""next pick."" This seems similar, reinforcing that there are positive outlooks for these stocks. The mention of a next pick suggests investors might be encouraged to buy, leading to an upward trend.

Now, considering each tweet's factors: Both tweets talk about gains, so they're positive. The overall sentiment is likely positive because the users believe these stocks are undervalued and have strong potential for growth.

I don't see any negative factors mentioned here; both are about gains without any warnings or risks. So, the stock price impact should be positive."
2015-01-11,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by extracting the target stock symbol from each tweet. The first tweet mentions switching from SD to HD video in instant video after an email, which could be a positive sign because wider product moats are a good indicator of growth potential. The second tweet talks about trading pivoting around GPO and BABA before the open time and mentions 30-minute charts, suggesting a strategy for price changes during trading hours. 

Now, I'll break down each tweet into factors: Positive and Negative. For the first tweet, the change in video format is a positive factor as it could indicate higher demand or market expansion. The reason for the refund is also a positive outcome since refunds can signal financial stability. So both factors are positive.

In the second tweet, I'm not immediately sure about the factors. It's talking about trading strategies and price changes before the open time, but without specific data on market trends or company performance, it's hard to tell if this is a strong positive or negative factor. However, since it's about pivot points for price movements, it might influence investor expectations about future stock prices.

Putting it all together: both tweets are positive because they show potential growth areas and strategic actions that could impact Amazon's future performance."
2015-01-12,Neutral,"Alright, I need to figure out how to assess the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually.

First, ""AT_USER stock rises tomorrow ? $ amzn"" seems straightforward. It's talking about whether the Amazon stock will rise tomorrow and what the price might be. This is a factual question that could influence investor expectations, but it doesn't present any positive or negative information directly.

Next, ""transparent of $ am zn won best comedy tv series golden globe . bezos prime just starting , reed should exert more effort $ nflx ."" Here, there's some marketing talk about Amazon winning a major deal, which is likely a positive sign. But the mention of ""best comedy tv series"" and ""Bezos Prime"" could be seen as negative if it implies negativity or criticism. It might influence investor sentiment in that direction.

Lastly, ""commented on : 'innovative food holdings : the cheapest company in foodtech' URL $ ivfh $ amzn $ chef $ syy."" This tweet is promoting Amazon's innovative products and services, specifically highlighting its position as a cheapest company in food tech. This suggests positive developments for Amazon's future.

Considering all these tweets, the positive ones indicate growth opportunities in innovation and customer satisfaction, while the negative one about the TV show could raise concerns. However, overall, the tweets are providing information that could positively impact Amazon's stock."
2015-01-13,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets about Amazon's stock and determine their impact on the future stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. It looks like they all mention ""amazon."" So, the focus is on AMZN.

1. The first tweet mentions ""track trending assets in 1 watchlist $ amzn $ gsk $ bby $ c $ csco URL."" This seems to be a list of assets, not directly related to AMZN's performance or any other stock mentioned.

2. The second tweet talks about the sentiment for the S&P 1500 stocks at midday with specific stocks like $ mrk , $ amzn , etc., but it mentions Alexandria and refers to ""2015/01 / 13."" Since this is a general mention of sentiment, not specific to AMZN, I'm unsure if it directly affects the stock price.

3. The third tweet uses RT and lists tweets related to other stocks like $ qqq, $ algos, etc., but doesn't target AMZN. So, no direct impact on AMZN's performance.

4. This tweet is about an upgrade to AMZN without a positive point (pt). Upgrades usually don't inherently affect the price but can indicate investor confidence or strategic decisions.

5. The tweet mentions Amazon getting an upgrade at $c without pt and refers to ""without pt."" Similar to tweet 4, this could be a sign of strategic changes or company strength, which might influence sentiment positively.

6. This one talks about swing trades alerting users about AMZN, Netflix, and TSLA gaining prestige with the golden globe win and subscribers. Although it mentions multiple stocks, this is more related to market trends rather than specific stock performance.

7. The tweet states that despite three big upgrades today ( Appl, Amzn, Bby), the upgrade/ downgrade ratio continues trending lower. This seems like a technical analysis point where if the ratio is going down, it might be viewed negatively as it could indicate weaker fundamentals for AMZN.

8. This tweet lists several users mentioning AMZN and other stocks, but doesn't specify whether it's positive or negative regarding AMZN. It might be indicating general sentiment across multiple companies.

9. The tweet mentions AMZN being on the down low and grindsr, referring to the stock. No specific information about performance here.

Considering all the tweets, the main points are upgrades (trenddown), which could indicate a positive or mixed sentiment because it's often seen as an opportunity in tech, especially Amazon. However, the downgrade ratio is mentioned in tweet 7, suggesting potential weakening of AMZN's fundamentals, which could be negative.

The third and fourth tweets don't specifically target AMZN but mention other stocks, so their impact on AMZN isn't clear. The swing trade alert in tweet 6 might create buzz around AMZN, potentially influencing investor sentiment, but it doesn't directly point to a positive or negative action affecting the stock price.

Putting this together, the most significant factors affecting AMZN's price are the upgrades (trenddown) and the swing trades. While swing trades can lead to gains, the upgrade trend suggests potential weakness in fundamentals. However, without concrete information on AMZN's financial health, it's challenging to determine a clear overall sentiment.

Therefore, considering the technical indicators and market movements, I'm leaning towards a [Negative] overall sentiment because the upgrades could indicate an expectation of decline in future performance."
2015-01-14,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by going through each tweet one by one.

First tweet: ""why amazon is likely to never make a profit ( amzn ) $ am zn url"". It seems like the user is questioning if Amazon will ever make a profit and mentions a URL, which might be an unrelated term here. I don't have any information on that topic, so it's hard to assess.

Second tweet: ""$ goog $ amzn : cloud computing : is it a two horse race among url inc ... url"". This one talks about Google, Amazon, Cloud Computing, and mentions URL Inc. It doesn't provide any specific analysis or prediction related to stock performance. I'll have to see more information later on this.

Third tweet: ""rt AT_USER new post : the cult of amazon has turned into shuffleboard players in boca raton url $ amzn nflxqqqsp …"". This seems like a reaction from a user (AT_USER) regarding Amazon's cult following turning into something random. It mentions URL Inc., NFLX, QQQ, SP, and others. I'm not sure what ""shuffled board players"" means in this context. It could be a joke or a speculative claim, but without more context, it's difficult to assess.

Fourth tweet: ""rt AT_USER strong revenue growth and the prospect of improving margins make a bull case for amazon : url amzn"". This one says that Amazon has strong revenue and improved margins, predicting a bullish trend. It doesn't specify any positive or negative aspects related to stock performance but mentions trends in the business. I might lean towards a Positive sentiment here because of the upcoming growth.

Fifth tweet: ""$ am zn chart looks like a downside risk 245-248"". It's looking at Amazon's chart and predicting a potential downward risk between 245-248. This seems to be a technical analysis, suggesting that market conditions are moving in an unfavorable direction. Technical analysis can sometimes predict stock movements based on price trends, so this might indicate a Negative sentiment.

Sixth tweet: ""brooklyn's AT_USER crafts public offering , putting nyctech back on the map url via at_user gs ms amzn baba"". The user is talking about a public Offering by Brooklyn Quantum (NGTC), which puts NYCTech back into the mix, suggesting they're taking advantage of the market. This could be speculative but might indicate some optimism or cautious behavior in the stock market.

Seventh tweet: ""cramer's mad money : a different kind of market ( 1/13 / 15 ) url aapl apple amzn kbh tsla flex halo tlt celg dis"". This seems to be from Cramer's Mad Money, discussing different markets and companies. It mentions several stocks including Apple, Amazon, Tesla, etc. Since it's talking about other markets, I'm not sure how this relates to Amazon's stock performance. It might just be a report or analysis in another sector.

So summarizing each tweet:

1. Unrelated or ambiguous information.
2. No specific info, speculative.
3. Speculative reaction about the cult following turning into something random; no clear impact on stock.
4. Strong revenue and margins predicting upward trend—Positive possible.
5. Technical chart suggesting downward risk—Negative possible.
6. Speculative stock offering move—Positive or cautious behavior—but not directly related to Amazon.
7. Diversified analysis across different sectors, no immediate link to Amazon's performance.

Given these thoughts, the most certain positive tweet is number 4. The other tweets are either too ambiguous, speculative, or unrelated. So overall sentiment is Positive."
2015-01-15,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

First tweet is ""stick a fork in amazon : gene munster's stock of the year is done URL $ amzn"". It sounds like they're dismissing Amazon as done for things like the tax deal, so that's negative.

Second tweet says $ amzn - eu to explain illegality of amazon's tax deal. Again, talking about something illegal, which makes me think there's an issue with Amazon's tax handling. So another negative point.

Third tweet is ""our new penny stock pick was just released on $ ijjp ! huge update : URL $ amzn $ qcom $ csco"". This looks like a positive announcement about getting more tech stocks, so that should be good news for Amazon. Positive factor.

Fourth tweet: ""$ ebr opinions updated thursday , january 15 , 2015 06:03 : 17 am $ axp $ gld $ amzn $ spxl URL"". Updating EBR opinions on a specific date, but it's not clear if that relates to Amazon. Maybe just some stock prices, so perhaps no major impact.

So combining these factors: two negative tweets about Amazon's tax deal and one positive update with other tech stocks. I'm leaning towards mixed. But since one tweet is clearly negative, maybe the overall sentiment leans negative."
2015-01-16,Negative,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how these tweets affect Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First tweet is about the first season of Amazon's pilot series slate. The word ""pilot"" can mean both positive and negative depending on context. It might not significantly impact investor sentiment here.

Second tweet mentions $QQQ is trading at 100.49, which is above its previous price. That suggests some gains or stability, but without more info, it's hard to tell if it's positive or neutral.

Third tweet talks about selling alerts from the Nasdaq strategy, so that might indicate卖出 signals, potentially negative for Amazon as they sell shares they think are undervalued.

Fourth tweet also mentions QQQ with a price above f/v and p/t. Again, not enough info to assess sentiment.

Fifth tweet says QQQ is trading at 100.23, which is a bit lower than previous, but if it's trending down, that could be negative. But the text itself isn't giving much context beyond its price movement.

Sixth tweet mentions Russia's direxion with a bearish outlook, but without context on QQQ or other stocks related to directrix (which seems unrelated), this might not affect Amazon's price much.

Seventh tweet discusses QQQ being triggered by algos like sigma-x, crossfinder, ats, and lx. This could lead to negative sentiment if people sell shares they think are undervalued.

Eighth tweet also mentions QQQ with a p/t of 93, which is above its previous price. Again, not enough context for sentiment analysis.

Ninth tweet simply states bank and tech stocks dragging sales losses but doesn't provide specific info on QQQ or other stocks mentioned.

Putting it all together: The main points are positive sales losses due to banks and tech, a selling signal from Nasdaq for QQQ, which might push price down. The directrix report is unrelated, so maybe not affecting Amazon's stock. The p/t of QQQ isn't enough either.

Overall, the negative sentiment seems strongest here because of the ongoing bank/tech issues impacting sales. So I'd conclude it's Negative."
2015-01-17,Neutral,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to analyze some tweets about investing and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. They've provided specific instructions to identify the target stock, parse each tweet into factors, assess sentiment, and then summarize the overall effect.

First, I need to figure out which stock symbol is in play here. Looking at the tweets, they all mention $ amzn $ aapl $ bidu $ cree. These look like stock ticker symbols: AmZN,AAPL, BIDU, CREE. So, it's likely that the target stock is Apple Inc., since it's the most prominent among these.

Next, I should go through each tweet one by one to extract factors and assess sentiment. Let me list them out:

1. ""how to invest : market declines influence stock bases URL $ amzn $ aapl $ bidu $ cree""
2. The rest of the tweets are similar variations of this question about investing strategies.

For each tweet, I'll note whether it contributes positively or negatively to Apple's stock price. I think that any advice related to investing in general would have a neutral impact unless it's specific to Apple. However, since all tweets mention other stocks, maybe they're not targeting Apple specifically.

Considering Apple's fundamentals and industry position, the tweet seems more about investment strategies than company-specific news. Therefore, the sentiment might be neutral because while investors are given advice that could be relevant, it doesn't directly impact Apple's stock price unless there are specific trends or events linked to Apple.

Wait, but I'm supposed to conclude with a single line. Since none of these tweets mention anything about Apple's financial health, performance, or any significant news related to the stock, their impact seems neutral. So, I'll say it's [Neutral]."
2015-01-18,Positive,"Alright, I'm looking at these two tweets related to Amazon stock. The first tweet is about $amzn updates for January 18, 2015. It mentions financials and a company called ""ugaz."" Hmm, the mention of ""ugaz"" isn't familiar or meaningful in this context. I wonder if that's a typo or just irrelevant information.

The second tweet talks about reviews for Amazon on January 18, 2015, by companies like BRCM and Pal. This seems to be related to customer satisfaction or product performance. Positive reviews can generally indicate good news, which might boost the stock price. But I should consider if these reviews are recent enough.

Amazon is a well-known company in tech, so their stock is significant. The overall sentiment from these tweets suggests that there's some positive information about their operations or products. However, since the first tweet lacks context and seems out of place with financials and ""ugaz,"" I should lean more towards positivity based on the review tweet.

But wait, if the first tweet doesn't provide any meaningful data, maybe it's just a generic announcement without specific content related to Amazon. That could be misleading or even negative if it affects investor confidence. However, considering that there are two tweets, perhaps the overall impact is still positive because the second one clearly mentions reviews.

So, I'll assess both factors and decide on [Positive] as the overall sentiment since there's a clear positive indication from the review tweet, even though the first tweet's content is less relevant."
2015-01-19,Missing,File not found
2015-01-20,Neutral,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on AT&T (AT&T) stock. I'm not too familiar with all the financial terms here, so I'll have to break it down step by step.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""AT_USER $ nflx notice the bottom content acquisition that is what $ amzn is doing URL $ didg"". Hmm, AT_USER seems like a username or maybe some kind of identifier. The words ""bottom content"" and ""acquisition"" are interesting. I'm not sure what exactly is being noticed here—maybe something about their stock's performance? But the rest seems a bit unclear. I'll have to keep this one aside for now.

The second tweet starts with ""great free tutorial here for traders URL $ nflx $ bac $ amzn $ msft $ aapl $ goog $ googl $ feye URL"". This looks like a long list of company names followed by another URL, which might be redirecting somewhere. Since it's a tutorial for traders and mentions multiple companies including AT&T (ATL), this could mean they're suggesting some resources related to trading AT&T stock.

Moving on to the third tweet: ""$ amzn received a new alert . find out why at URL stocks daytrading trading mkt nyse nasdaq markets 407"". Here, ""alert"" is mentioned. I know that alerts can indicate potential news about something, so this might mean that there's an upcoming news event related to AT&T stock. If they're getting a new alert, it could affect investor sentiment positively or negatively depending on the information.

Now, for the overall sentiment summary: The first tweet doesn't provide much context; maybe it's a dummy tweet. The second one is more promotional and seems like it might be helpful but not necessarily causing any immediate movement. The third tweet introduces an alert which can either push people to trade or stay informed, which could lead to positive sentiment as investors react.

Considering all these factors—maybe the first tweet is just a buzzword without actual information. The second offers useful info that might influence trading but isn't pushing anyone right now. The third introduces something new, possibly increasing investor activity and expectation for news, leading to potential positive impact on stock price.

Putting it all together, even though not all tweets provide clear info, the one with the alert suggests an upcoming event that could cause a push towards higher stock prices."
2015-01-21,Neutral,"Alright, so I need to figure out how these tweets affect Amazon's stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol in both tweets. The first tweet mentions AMZN with several keywords: $ amzn, cost $ fdx, sne $ ups, and wmt. So that means the target is Amazon (AMZN).

The second tweet has ""rt AT_USER"" before it, which likely refers to user interactions on Twitter. It talks about AMZN not being as big or successful as someone thinks, but also mentions its big-box rivals aren't too bad either. It seems like a negative comment, indicating that people are skeptical about Amazon's success.

Now, I need to analyze each tweet separately. The first one is neutral because it only lists the stock symbol and some other hashtags without any positive or negative language. The second tweet is also neutral because it's just a retweet with some personal critique without extreme sentiment towards AMZN.

Since both tweets are neutral in their impact on AMZN, I can't see a clear positive or negative effect. Therefore, the overall sentiment is neutral."
2015-01-22,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the given company. The company's symbol is not explicitly provided, but looking at some of the tweets, I notice they mention NVIDIA (NVIDIA), because in tweet 13, there's a mention of ""nvidia"" when discussing Amazon books. So, let me focus on NVIDIA.

Looking at tweet 2, it talks about Netflix's performance and mentions ""cramer's mad money."" Cramer is a stock that's often associated with Netflix, so this might be a sentiment indicator for the company. 

In tweet 3, NVIDIA is mentioned in context of puts and calls. NVIDIA has gone through some stock buys, which can indicate investor interest or caution.

Tweets 4 to 10 discuss the S&P 500 performance, including factors like beta, risk-free rate, etc., which are indicators of market conditions but don't directly relate to NVIDIA's stock.

Tweets 7 and 8 mention refunds for Amazon video on SD to HD. This could be a positive sign for Amazon, which might imply that NVIDIA is benefiting from this change, potentially affecting investor sentiment.

Tweets 10 and 12 talk about NVIDIA stock movements—back at highs—and then some reactions after the moves. This shows that NVIDIA's performance can go up and down based on market conditions.

Tweets 13 mentions books by NVIDIA related to their Dragon project, which could be a positive for the company if it gains traction or has press releases.

Overall, the tweets indicate that NVIDIA is being discussed in multiple contexts—market performance, technical analysis (puts, calls), and community reactions. These signals can influence investor sentiment positively because they show interest and different perspectives from various angles. The mention of refunds for Amazon might suggest a positive trend in Amazon's stock, which could indirectly affect NVIDIA as well.

Considering all the factors—positive mentions, technical indicators, market reactions—the overall sentiment is likely [Positive]. It reflects investor confidence in the company's position and possible future performance."
2015-01-23,Neutral,"Okay, I need to determine the likely impact on the future stock price of BABA based on the provided tweets. Let's go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at the tweets, all of them mention $ amzn and $ baba, so the target stock is Amazon (AMZN).

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. 

1. Tweet 1: Positive mentions include GSPC, SBUX, FB, AMZN, GOOG, ALPHABET, TSLA, BIDU, GPRO, AAPL, QQQ, HFT. Negative mentions are none.
2. Tweet 2: Similar to tweet 1; all positive and no negatives.
3. Tweet 3: Same as tweets 1-2.
4. Tweet 4: All same again.
5.Tweet 5: Positive factors include FB, AMZN, GOOG, ALPHABET, TSLA, BIDU, GPRO, AAPL, QQQ, HFT. Negative mentions are none.
6. Tweet 6: Same as tweets 1-4; no negatives except SBUX.
7. Tweet 7: Positive factors include FB, AMZN, GOOG, ALPHABET, TSLA, BIDU, GPRO, AAPL, QQQ, HFT. Negative mentions are none.
8. Tweet 8: Positive factors include FB, AMZN, GOOG, ALPHABET, TSLA, BIDU, GPRO, AAPL, QQQ, HFT. No negatives mentioned.
9. Tweet 9: Same as tweets 1-7; no negatives except SBUX.
10. Tweet 10: Positive factors include FB, AMZN, GOOG, ALPHABET, TSLA, BIDU, GPRO, AAPL, QQQ, HFT. Negative mentions are none.
11. Tweet 11: Same as tweets 1-2; no negatives.
12. Tweet 12: Same as above.

Now, I need to assess the sentiment of each tweet. 

Most tweets are positive because they mention AMZN and other stocks which are part of BABA's portfolio or related to tech companies. There aren't any negative factors mentioned in any of these tweets.

Given that all relevant tweets are positive, it suggests that there isn't much negative news impacting Amazon right now. The focus is on the market, tech companies, and positive developments like the stock wars and AMZN's performance.

Therefore, considering no negative factors and positive sentiment across all relevant tweets, the overall impact is likely neutral."
2015-01-24,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by looking at each tweet and breaking it down.

The first tweet mentions that ""our penny stock picks gained 968% in 5 weeks"" and asks about the next pick. That sounds like positive news because it's talking about significant gains, which usually boosts investor confidence. So, that's a good sign pointing towards a Positive sentiment.

Next, the second tweet is from January 24, 2015, updating the stock message board. The time period seems specific and old. It mentions ""saturday"" in December, so I'm not sure what that means. The prices are all lowercase letters with dollar signs, like $celg, $amzn, etc. That's confusing because they're likely abbreviations or names of stock symbols, which don't make sense for a tweet about AMZN. Maybe it's just a placeholder or typo. I'll leave this one as neutral because the information doesn't seem relevant to AMZN.

The third tweet is ""rt AT_USER eu to publish details of probe into amazon's luxembourg tax deal URL $ amzn."" The user is responding to something, which might indicate that they're checking if there's a tax deal involving Amazon. If that's true and it gains attention, it could be positive or neutral depending on the context. But since it's speculative and doesn't provide specific information about stock performance, I'm not sure it adds much to the overall sentiment. So this tweet seems neutral.

Putting it all together: Two positive factors (first two tweets) but one neutral third tweet. Maybe some mixed signals, but the most significant factor is the 968% gain, which should tip the scale towards Positive."
2015-01-25,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of the given company. 

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. The second tweet mentions ""msft,"" which is the ticker symbol for Microsoft. So, the stock in question here is Microsoft.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one to assess their impact. The first tweet says: ""rt AT_USER ypt megacap ' nets / ( $ qnet 100 % retrace wk . ) momo trade this week ! $ amzn $ goog $ lnkd $ nflx URL ht …"" It seems like it's discussing the earnings of several companies, including Amazon, LinkedIn, Facebook, and NVIDIA. The mention of ""momo trade"" suggests that there might be some positive talk about stock trading in general, but I'm not sure how directly this affects Microsoft's stock. Maybe investors are talking more about other stocks, which could influence their views on Microsoft.

The second tweet is: ""interesting week this ... earnings for some big names mon - $ msft tues - $ aapl , $ t weds - $ fb thur - $ goog , $ amzn fri - $ cvx."" This one lists the earnings of several companies, including Microsoft. It seems like positive news about their earnings could make investors feel better and maybe increase their confidence in Microsoft's stock.

Now, to determine the overall sentiment. The first tweet is more about other companies' earnings, which might not have a direct impact on Microsoft's stock price. However, the second tweet is clearly about Microsoft's earnings, which is positive news. Since there are mentions of increased investor confidence from positive earnings reports, it suggests that the overall sentiment is positive.

So, combining these thoughts, even though the first tweet doesn't directly mention Microsoft, the positive earnings report in the second tweet is a significant factor influencing investor sentiment. This leads me to conclude that the stock is likely going up."
2015-01-26,Negative,"Alright, let me figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on Amazon's stock price. So, first, I need to understand each tweet and what they're saying.

The first tweet is a quote from AMZN with some metrics. It mentions that the stock is at $309.36 and shows a drop of -3.03 points or about -0.97%. That's negative news, but it's not very significant on its own because it's just a single data point.

The second tweet uses hashtags like AT_USER, which I think might mean the user is making some positive comments about AMZN. The word ""earnings calendar"" could be a reference to earnings reports or financial updates. So, this tweet is probably sharing information related to the company's performance. But it's more of an announcement than a detailed analysis.

The third tweet is from a trader who thinks you should buy Amazon now. It mentions ""why you should buy amazon now"" and includes several URLs. This seems like a call to action. Traders often react to news about earnings or other positive developments, which can push the stock up.

Now, I need to break down each factor in each tweet:

1. First tweet: Negative price movement.
2. Second tweet: Positive information but just a short mention of earnings.
3. Third tweet: Positive action from a trader reacting to market expectations.

Each of these is a separate event that could influence stock prices, but they're spread out over time and may have different impacts depending on the current market conditions. However, none of them seems particularly strong or dominant in their respective aspects. It's more about how each tweet reacts rather than just looking at one piece of information.

Looking at the output requirements, I need to conclude with a single line stating whether it's positive, neutral, or negative overall. The overall sentiment is influenced by multiple factors, but since they are separate tweets and not consolidating a specific trend, I can't make an absolute conclusion. It seems like there's some positive information and a potential reaction from traders, but each tweet has its own context and timing.

I think the best way to present this is with ""[Neutral]"" because while there are mixed signals—some positive aspects mentioned in tweets 2 and 3—it doesn't indicate a clear overall trend or significant impact on stock price yet. The negative tweet could potentially pull the price down, but it's too brief for a strong enough signal."
2015-01-27,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the likely impact on the stock price of a company based on the given tweets. Let me start by breaking down each tweet and seeing what they're saying.

First tweet: The user mentions that another headwind will come into play as rotation moves into companies like Apple, Google, etc., and also suggests filling up retirement funds. It sounds like there's some anxiety about potential dips but no clear positive or negative indication yet.

Second tweet: The user is excited about $MA near $80, $AIG near $50, and $AMZN under $300. They're suggesting a good sale for stocks related to retirement investments. This seems like a mix of potential upside and cautionary advice, which might balance out the impact.

Third tweet: The user is making some market updates using Twitter's RT feature, mentioning specific companies and their prices. This could be providing technical analysis or information that might influence investor sentiment.

Fourth tweet: Another market update, listing several stocks with varying prices. This seems like a continuation of point three but is more detailed about which stocks to watch.

Fifth tweet: The user is asking what's true between two scientific theories—chemists finding a way to unboil eggs or $AMZN making profit. There’s a mix here, talking about unrelated facts with a mix of positive and negative angles.

Sixth tweet is just multiple @ signs, which doesn't provide any specific information on the stock price.

Seventh tweet: Similar to the fifth, but again with potential for positive or negative thoughts from Twitter users. It's not clear whether this is encouraging or discouraging sentiment.

Now, I need to analyze each tweet in terms of factors and their impact. The first tweet introduces uncertainty without a clear outcome. The second suggests both upside gains and cautionary advice. Third and fourth tweets provide context with technical info but don’t tip the scale. Fifth tweet flips between tech and financial speculation, which could be speculative. Sixth tweet is vague. Seventh might lean either way depending on Twitter's mood.

Given that some tweets suggest potential good news for stocks (like $AMZN under $300) and others are cautious or speculative, I don't see a clear positive or negative trend. The overall sentiment seems neutral because the information isn't strongly supportive or opposing."
2015-01-28,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about stock prices. So, I have three tweets here, and each one talks about various companies and their earnings reports or potential stock movements.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""rbc capital chimes in on $ amzn ahead of q4 ’ 14 earnings . is now the time to buy ? URL earnings stocks wallstreet"". It seems like rbc thinks Amazon is near the end of its fourth quarter and suggests buying stocks. That sounds positive because it's talking about upcoming earnings and suggesting a stock to invest in.

The second tweet: ""$ aapl $ amzn $ dal $ luv : skymall may fly again with potential bid : URL"". This one mentions several companies, including Skymall, which I'm not sure about, but it says Skymall might fly. That's vague, and since there's uncertainty about Skymall, this could be a mix of positive and negative, maybe just neutral.

The third tweet: ""$ aapl trade setups - $ aapl $ djia $ compq $ spx $ amzn $ baba $ bidu $ cat $ fas $ fb $ googl $ gpro $ hal $ nflx $ tsla $ twtr - URL"". This is about trading setups for Amazon, DJIA, CompQ, S&P 500, AMZN, BABA, Bidu, Cat, etc. It seems more technical and about stock strategies rather than predicting price movements.

So, breaking it down: the first tweet is definitely positive because it's making a buy suggestion based on future earnings. The second has some uncertainty but isn't extremely clear, so it might be neutral. The third is talking about trading, which relates to strategies, not direct market sentiment.

Putting it all together, while the first and third tweets are about stock-related advice, the second tweet's mention of Skymall introduces uncertainty. However, since there's a strong suggestion in the first tweet about Amazon, that might be the primary positive factor. The other tweets don't have as much impact because they're more about strategy than predicting price movements."
2015-01-29,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how the provided tweets affect Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet mentions revenue rising $ amzn URL via AT_USER, but it doesn't specify if that's positive or negative.
2. The second tweet says shares are on fire after earnings topped targets, which makes me think investors are concerned about the stock price because they think Amazon is undervalued.
3. The third tweet lists several companies with increased buzz and updated prices. This shows increased interest in these stocks, possibly affecting Amazon's market position.
4. The fourth tweet talks about Greece, McDonald's, Google, etc., which could be unrelated to Amazon's performance.
5. The fifth tweet mentions the full year 2014 earnings for Amazon, showing a positive financial quarter but not necessarily impacting stock price immediately.
6. The sixth tweet is live on demand after the Q4 earnings call, further signaling that Amazon is doing well.
7. The seventh tweet talks about lower net margins but still profitable, which might indicate better cost management or higher sales volume.
8. The eighth tweet mentions a morning update for January 29th with multiple stock picks. This could indicate increased interest in Amazon and other companies related to the day.
9. The ninth tweet suggests that Amazon's tech sector is moving, with specific stocks like Facebook, Apple, Google significantly higher. This could mean broader investor sentiment about economic trends affecting tech.
10. The tenth tweet states that there have been 54 quarters of double-digit revenue growth, which is a strong indicator of positive earnings performance.
11. The eleventh tweet provides stock prices for Amazon and Google, but it's unclear if this is real-time data or just hypothetical.
12. The twelfth tweet asks what the P/E ratio is on Amazon and then states that bullish sentiment is expected as part of the bull market. This could imply investor confidence in Amazon's future performance.
13-15: These tweets discuss earnings reports, but they don't provide specific data or opinions about Amazon's stock performance.
16-17: Statements about social sentiment with some company names and active investors, suggesting a positive outlook.
18-20: Talks about earnings reports from different companies and investor behavior, again without concrete information on Amazon's impact.
21-22: Reports on Amazon's slow sales growth relative to the recession trough but doesn't indicate negative or positive sentiment.

Considering all these tweets, the main indicators of positive sentiment come from the consistent double-digit revenue growth (10), strong earnings reports (8 and 9), increased stock price data (11), mentions of a bullish outlook due to the last wave of the bull market (12), and investor behavior suggesting optimism about the tech sector's future. While there are some unrelated statements, the positive indicators suggest a favorable overall sentiment.

So, putting it all together, the likely impact on Amazon's stock price is positive."
2015-01-30,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. I'm not too familiar with all the nuances of investing or stock market trends, so I'll have to go through each tweet one by one.

Starting with tweet 1: It mentions putting $500 to close at a profit. So, Amazon is buying some shares and making money from it. That seems positive because it's generating income. But I'm not sure if that alone is enough to make a big impact on the stock price. Maybe, but there are more tweets about Amazon.

Tweet 2 talks about trendline resistance. If something like the trendline is broken, that could push the stock up or even higher. But without knowing the expected direction of the trend, it's hard to say if this will help. It might not have a significant impact yet.

Tweets 3-10 are all about Amazon going up and making profits. There are mentions like ""service revenues"" which often show strong growth. The stock seems to be doing well despite some issues mentioned later on. So, these positive tweets suggest that the company is expanding into new areas or improving its operations.

Tweet 12 talks about a surge in price hitting 6-month highs but being hit with resistance at $350. That could mean the stock might recover or face support depending on the next moves. But without more context, it's tough to assess the overall impact yet.

Tweets 14-17 mention that big tech stocks are showing solid bids despite negative earnings expectations. This seems like a positive sign because companies with a lot of market capitalization don't need their valuations to be perfect; they just need to perform well on paper.

Tweet 19 talks about Amazon increasing its profit, which could indicate good performance. But if the trendline is broken or other factors are pulling it down, that might weigh it down. Also, the ""up 14%"" mentioned could be a specific point in time, so there's room for uncertainty.

Tweets 20-23 are about market reactions and stock alerts. A sudden alert from Amazon meaninging they're doing well is reassuring but doesn't necessarily predict a big move. The mention of trading on NYSE/NASDAQ markets suggests the company operates internationally or in other financial sectors, which could indicate broader trends affecting the stock.

Overall, most tweets seem positive about Amazon's performance and expansion, though there are some concerns mentioned later that might affect the stock price. Combined with their strong fundamentals (like increased revenue and solid valuation), these factors suggest a possible upward trend but not a guaranteed one."
2015-01-31,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. The user provided four tweets, so I need to go through each one step by step.

Starting with the first tweet: ""see what others are saying about super_trades - twitter testimonials : URL $ amzn $ fb $ ha $ abbv $ habt"". Hmm, this seems like a link to Twitter's social media insights or user testimonies regarding something called ""super_trades."" I'm not familiar with that term, but it might be a typo or a new concept. Without more context, it's hard to assess if this is positive or negative.

Moving on to the second tweet: ""$ amzn : us stocks , the ' january barometer ' live at the close : URL"". This looks like an economic report for January, probably from the U.S. stock market. Reports about the economy can give insight into investor sentiment. If it's a positive news about economic growth or corporate earnings, that could be a boost to Amazon's stock.

The third tweet is ""rt AT_USER amazon says prime membership growth grew 53 % in 2014 ! $ amzn"". This seems straightforward. It mentions that Amazon's prime membership growth was up by 53% in 2014. That's a concrete data point showing an increase, which generally can be seen as positive for the company.

The fourth tweet is ""rt AT_USER factoid from $ amzn 10 - k : company added 36,800 employees over past year "". Again, it's another report about Amazon's employee numbers. Adding employees can indicate growth and stability, which is generally a good sign for stock performance.

Putting it all together: The first tweet is vague but mentions positive trends like membership growth. The second tweet could provide economic indicators that are typically positive. The third tweet gives a specific data point of 53% growth in 2014, which shows a strong upward trend. The fourth tweet adds more employees, suggesting business expansion and future potential.

However, the first tweet's subject (""super_trades"") isn't something I'm aware of. If it's related to the stock market or some other industry-specific term, I might not have enough context to evaluate its impact accurately. Without knowing what ""super_trades"" stands for, my analysis could be based on assumptions rather than actual data.

Looking at the others, they all provide specific, quantifiable data that shows positive growth metrics. This combined with the third tweet's concrete 53% growth suggests that the company is doing well in terms of employees and membership. The second tweet adds economic insights which can influence investor sentiment positively as well, especially if it indicates a strong economy or positive business outlook.

But without information about the first tweet, I have to make an assumption. If ""super_trades"" isn't related to Amazon's performance but maybe something else, then its impact might be negligible or even negative. But that's just my guess. The other tweets are more directly related and likely provide solid positive indicators for Amazon's stock.

In summary, most of the tweets indicate positive trends with data points like growth in employees, memberships, and possibly some economic data. However, the first tweet is a bit ambiguous. If it doesn't relate to Amazon's performance, then my analysis might not fully reflect its impact. But considering the other tweets are all positive indicators, I'll lean towards a positive overall sentiment for Amazon."
2015-02-01,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price. First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet and then assess each tweet's factors.

Looking at the first tweet: ""great free tutorial here for traders URL $ nflx $ bac $ amzn $ msft $ aapl $ goog $ googl $ feye URL"". It mentions $ NFLX (next traded stock), but it doesn't specify which company. Maybe I should look elsewhere or assume it's about stocks listed around that time.

The second tweet: ""my video URL stock mkt analysis 1/30 / 15 $ spy $ qqq $ xlf $ aapl $ iwm $ amzn $ googl $ gld $ baba"". It mentions $ SPY (TechGV, now part of SPY), $ QQQ, and others. I think this is about stock analysis for those companies on a particular date.

Third tweet: ""rt AT_USER my video URL stock mkt analysis 1/30 / 15 $ spy $ qqq $ xlf $ aapl $ iwm $ amzn $ googl $ gld $ baba"". Similar to the second, mentions stock market analysis for those companies on January 30.

Fourth tweet: ""rt AT_USER new post : knock knock knocking on major support URL $ spy $ iwm $ aapl $ amzn $ baba stocks trading"". This seems like an update or message encouraging support and activity on these stocks. It's not specific about a company name, but given the context around the previous tweets, it might be talking about SPY.

Now, analyzing each tweet:

1. First tweet: No specific stock mentioned except $ NFLX, which I'm unsure of.
2. Second and third tweets: Both are about market analysis for several companies on Jan 30.
3. Fourth tweet is a message encouraging trading activity on certain stocks without specific names.

For sentiment, the fourth tweet seems positive with encouragement to trade. The others don't specify stock data, so it's hard to assess their impact. Without knowing the specific company or context, I can't evaluate if these tweets are favorable or unfavorable."
2015-02-02,Negative,"Okay, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the future stock price of a given company. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions $ biib $ amzn $ ziop $ gure $ invn. It's about multiple stock symbols, but it doesn't specify if these are positive or negative factors related to amzn. I can't tell much from this one, so maybe it's neutral.

2. The second tweet is a price update for $ amzn on February 2, 2015. Since it's just updating the price without any analysis, it might not have much impact. Probably neutral because it's just a date and price change, nothing major to go on.

3. Third tweet talks about AT_USER in the money video and earnings straddles with heavy volume on $ amzn. Heavy volume often indicates strong news or earnings reports, which can increase stock prices. But since it's just an interview, I'm not sure if the sentiment is positive or neutral. It could be a mix.

4. Fourth tweet mentions Google, Microsoft, and Amazon paying to block ads. This seems like a negative strategy, possibly aiming for negative earnings. So, this could lead to a decline in stock price. Maybe it's negative.

5. Fifth tweet talks about a watchlist for 2/2. Unless there's something specific about that day, it doesn't add much info. Neutral again.

6. Sixth tweet says the FOOL (AT_USER) is inaccurate and points out $ amzn's operating cash flow was $684 billion. If their reporting was wrong, this could erode investor confidence. It might lead to a negative impact on stock price.

7. Seventh tweet discusses amzn's price going from 1.10 to 9049 with some context. The high number seems way too extreme for a typo or error in price. This is probably not related to the company and could be neutral or even negative if it's just a made-up scenario.

8. Eighth tweet encourages buying amzn, especially during dips. While this might provide some positive sentiment by attracting short-term investors who are bearish on amzn, there might be fear of future volatility. It's uncertain whether the impact is strong or mixed.

9. Ninth tweet mentions $ amzn and $ baba earnings review. BABA could be a stock with significant industry influence, but since it's not related to amzn specifically, I can't make much of this tweet in terms of sentiment towards amzn.

So, putting it all together: There are some positive factors like heavy volume on amzn and an interview discussing earnings. Negative points include the FOOL's inaccurate reporting and a made-up price scenario. The overall sentiment seems mixed but leans more negative due to the potential for negative earnings impacts from the FOOL and the high price number."
2015-02-03,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their likely impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet says ""this dividend stock will never run out of cash."" This seems like a positive factor because dividend stocks are generally seen as good for investors. So I'll mark this as Positive.

2. The second tweet mentions futures and higher stock prices due to oil and energy news. That's another positive sign, so Positive.

3. The third tweet is ""rt AT_USER think investing in the cloud isn't important ? you're not paying enough attention to amazon."" It seems like Amazon is being critical of others' opinions on investing in cloud services. This could be seen as negative because it might lower investor confidence. So I'll consider this Negative.

4. The fourth tweet lists several stocks and ETFs, but without specific details about how these will affect Amazon's performance, it's hard to assess the sentiment right now. Maybe Neutral since we don't have enough information yet.

5. ""rt AT_USER amazon's operating cash flow is striking : $ amzn"" - This seems positive because higher cash flow generally benefits investors. So Positive.

6. The fifth tweet talks about the S&P 100 trends, which is a broad market indicator. If it goes up, that could be positive for Amazon stock. So Positive.

7. The sixth tweet mentions tax-sweetener probes in Belgium, which might lead to regulations or changes in investor sentiment. This seems speculative and not directly related to Amazon's performance, so maybe Neutral because we can't be sure it'll have a significant impact.

8. The seventh tweet is about 5 reasons Amazon should buy RadioShack's stores but mentions the story isn't crazy. This sounds like a positive warning, so Positive.

9. The eighth tweet talks about investing in NFLX and TSLA, which are tech companies. These could be negative factors for Amazon if they perform poorly, but without more info, it's uncertain.

10. ""ampz tops in if this jackass starts getting on board."" Jackass here likely refers to Amazon or another company. This suggests that its success might drive stock performance positively, so Positive.

11. The eleventh tweet says ""take the money and run,"" which is a strong negative signal because it's aggressive buying without considering long-term implications.

12. The twelfth tweet is about other users' tweets on SuperTrades on Twitter. Without specific links or context, this could be a minor trend that might affect Amazon stock but probably not enough to change the overall sentiment.

Putting it all together: Positive from points 1 and 2. Neutral for point 4. Negative for point 3, point 7. Point 5 is positive, point 6 uncertain. Points 8 and 10 also seem positive. However, there's a strong negative in point 11. Overall, the positives are enough to outweigh the negatives from points 3 and 11.

So the overall sentiment leans toward Positive because the positive factors outweigh the minor negatives."
2015-02-04,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether these tweets affect the stock price of a company and what kind of impact they might have. Let's take it step by step.

First, looking at each tweet individually.

1. ""rt AT_USER amazon still dominates the $ 16 billion cloud market $ amzn $ msft $ ibm url"". This looks like a positive message from Amazon's user base expressing their dominance in the cloud market. That sounds good for the stock, so probably positive sentiment here.

2. ""it's a bird , it's a plane , nah that's just an alibaba drone . $ baba gets into drone delivery business . your move $ amzn url"". This is from BABA and seems to indicate they're moving into drone delivery. Since drones are in the tech sector, especially within the drone delivery space which can impact Amazon as a competitor or provider of similar services. But this tweet doesn't directly mention Amazon but talks about their drone deliveries. It's just an update without specific news about AMZN, so maybe it's neutral.

3. ""AT_USER interested to see that $ amzn is now offering import / export tools for ec2 vm images now , url"". This seems like a positive action from Amazon adding tools for import/export on EC2 VMs. More tech-related features can attract investors and improve market performance, so this would be a positive tweet.

4. ""the morning dump - feb 4th spinoff $ yhoo adblock $ goog $ msft $ aapl $ ibm $ amzn kindle wearable ipad url"". This is about a spin-off of YHOO (Apple) and other companies likegoog, msft (Microsoft), etc., focusing on products related to the Kindle, Apple Watch, and iPad. Spin-offs can have mixed effects; it might affect competition but also new revenue streams. It's not very specific about AMZN so maybe neutral.

5. ""$ amzn - staples agrees to buy office depot - - 3rd update url"". This seems like a business deal where staples is buying office depots. Staples is a retail company, and office depots are physical goods sold, which could be seen as a positive for supply chain stability or revenue streams. It might attract more customers, but again, it's not directly related to AMZN unless there's a market share impact. Maybe slightly positive.

Now, combining the factors: The tweets mention various tech-related products and services (like drone deliveries, import/export tools, Kindle, Office depot deals) which could influence the stock price positively if these sectors are beneficial for Amazon or their customers. But each tweet is somewhat vague and doesn't specify a clear trend. However, some do indicate potential positive developments, especially with the drone delivery update from BABA. The import/export tool tweet sounds like it could attract more clients, but without specific mention of AMZN's stock, it's hard to say exactly how significant.

Overall, while there are several positive elements across the tweets, they seem a bit spread out and not all directly related. However, given that one of them is a clear signal for drone deliveries (which Amazon might be expanding into), this could boost their market position. Therefore, I lean towards a positive sentiment overall."
2015-02-05,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by looking at each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet says ""can the ruins of radioshack save the $ amzn amazon fire?"" It mentions that distribution isn't an issue because the user didn't provide a URL and talks about not being able to track fire incidents via radiation sources. This seems like a possible positive point, but I'm not sure if it's significant enough to outweigh other factors.

2. The second tweet is ""will sellers steer customers to $ amzn log in and pay instead of applepay ( $ aapl ) . URL"" It suggests that Amazon might be offering better pricing or customer service than Apple, which could affect the market. This seems like a strong positive because it's indicating that Amazon is doing something different from competitors.

3. The third tweet is ""rt AT_USER ' brands should think of a ' marketing supply chain ' the way they think of a physical one ' at_user on ge , $ amzn advant …"" It's talking about the supply chain aspect, which could mean that Amazon's products are being marketed more effectively than competitors. This seems like a positive point.

4. The fourth tweet is ""p & l for the day . missed out on short $ nflx calls on rallies and that morning ridiculous long on $ amzn URL"" It mentions financials and specific stock movements. Missing short positions on NFLX but making large gains on Amazon could impact investor sentiment negatively if they become more confident in Amazon.

5. The fifth tweet is ""$ amzn 600 by end uv thu year ( only on stocktwits can u find this nonsense ) URL"" It seems like a promotional offer where Amazon gets $600 for every Amazon share. This promotion could boost Amazon's stock price because it offers a significant bonus, which might make the stock more attractive.

6. The sixth tweet is ""AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER AT_USER oakmark says $ amzn is cheap = i guess so 300-370?"" It's a direct statement from Amazon's CEO (Bob Shrell) where he says Amazon is cheap, between $300 and $370. This could imply that Amazon is trading at a lower price than the market might expect, which could signal concern but also possible excitement.

7. The seventh tweet is ""rt : URL webinar free webinar on daytrading for powerful returns URL $ amzn $ fb $ twtr"" It links to a webinar about day trading and potential higher returns. While this could be a positive indicator of Amazon's technical capabilities, it might not directly impact the stock price unless there are specific concerns.

8. The eighth tweet is ""s & p100 stocks trend $ dis $ gm $ v $ f $ cost $ hd $ all $ dvn $ hon $ apa $ tgt $ amzn $ oxy $ xom $ low $ sbux $ ba $ utx @ URL"" It lists multiple stock prices and a mix of companies, including Amazon. This could mean that Amazon is performing well in the sector, which would be a positive indicator.

9. The ninth tweet is ""$ amzn net sales reached $ 88.99 b in 2014 , up from $ 74.45 b in 2013 - URL $ amzn"" It mentions revenue growth over two years, which could indicate strong performance and possibly higher stock price.

Now, combining these thoughts: The second tweet is a direct comparison with Apple, suggesting Amazon has better pricing or customer service. The fifth tweet offers a significant promotional offer. The third tweet talks about supply chain efficiency. The eighth tweet lists Amazon's sector stocks performing well. The ninth shows revenue growth. While some are positive (Apple comparison, promotions, Amazon performance), others could be conflicting, like the direct CEO statement suggesting lower prices.

Overall, there seems to be both positive signs and mixed reactions. However, the most prominent positives are the direct competitor comparison with Apple, the promotional offer, Amazon's sector performance, and revenue growth. These all suggest potential for a positive stock outcome."
2015-02-06,Positive,"Alright, let's try to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. I'm not sure what specific stock they're referring to, but maybe it can be inferred from the first tweet about AT_USER loading in $ mine as well, which mentions $ dewm qualifying as OTC and AMZN is a big distributor.

Looking at each tweet one by one:

1. The first tweet talks about AT_USER loading into $ mine and mentions $ SUTI as a product with AMZN being a big distributor. That suggests positive information because it highlights a company's performance or something favorable, which usually boosts investor confidence.

2. The second tweet mentions that our penny stock on $ suti gained 133% today. That sounds like a significant increase in value, which would definitely be positive for the stock price.

3. The third tweet discusses the S&P 500's trends and some stocks listed there. It doesn't mention anything negative or just neutral; it's about the market overall but not clearly leaning one way.

4. The fourth tweet mentions a trade using archer with moving averages and V1. It could be about the stock's technical analysis, which might influence prices, but without specific information on whether it's positive or negative, it's hard to say for sure.

5. The fifth tweet talks about a dip in TWTR (Time Weighted Average Price) and mentions NFLX and APEL. A dip could mean that some stocks are underperforming, which might be seen as a negative signal if the dip affects the overall market sentiment, but it's not explicitly stated.

6. The sixth tweet adds information about target prices and average ratings. While this is positive in terms of expectations, without specifics on how that impacts the stock itself, it's neutral to me.

7. The seventh tweet offers a free tutorial for traders using several stocks. Similar to other tweets, it's introducing new information but doesn't provide specific data or analysis about the stock's performance.

Considering all these points, the first two tweets are very positive, mentioning $ SUTI gains and AMZN as a big distributor. The overall sentiment seems to be positive because of these strong, direct mentions that highlight favorable information for the stock."
2015-02-07,Neutral,"Okay, so I have to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of an unknown company. The user has provided three tweets and wants me to evaluate them as positive, neutral, or negative for a given company's stock.

First, I need to figure out what each tweet is about. Looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER latest quarter sales , yoy growth : $ twtr $ 479m 97 % $ fb $ 3.9 b 49 % $ lnkd $ 643m 44 % $ aapl $ 74.6 b 30 % $ amzn $ 29.3 b 15 % $ goog …"" Hmm, this seems like it's comparing financial metrics for some company(s) and stock symbols. Maybe it's about the performance of certain stocks in relation to AT_USER, which I'm not familiar with. The numbers are in millions and billions, so that might relate to revenue or something similar.

The second tweet: ""rt FPTM last year’s Q3 EBITDA was $50b ... "" This is another set of financial metrics for a different company, FPTM. Not sure about its relevance unless it's related to the first tweet's companies.

Third tweet: ""rt TSLA last quarter’s revenue and net income : $489b 16% $ gulf $ 370m 23% ...$ msft $ 50.1 b 8% ..."" This again mentions specific company metrics, probably a different company (TSLA) with some numbers.

Wait, the user mentioned ""given a given company."" Since I don't know which tweet is related to which company, I'm not sure how to proceed. Maybe each tweet refers to a different company's financial statements or something else entirely. But without more context, it's hard to tell what these tweets are about.

I think I need to assume that each tweet might be referring to the same company in terms of content but different stock symbols. Alternatively, maybe they're all from the same company with different metrics. But without more info, it's speculative.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the user expects me to consider that all tweets are about a single company and focus on their financial data. If I make an assumption here, like the first tweet is about company X, then the other tweets could be about other companies or same company with different aspects.

But since I don't have context, my analysis will have to go with the initial understanding that each tweet might relate to a different stock but all part of the same company's financial data. So I'll assess each factor as positive, negative, neutral based on their metrics and see how they collectively affect the overall sentiment.

Looking at the first tweet: sales growth percentages like 97%, 49%, etc., which are good numbers. The revenue is increasing, so that's positive. But then it mentions ""lnkd"" and ""goog …"", maybe referring to the LinkedIn stock or Google? I'm not sure. Maybe these are related to different companies.

Without specific context about what each tweet represents in terms of a company's financial metrics, it's challenging. So perhaps I should proceed by considering that all tweets are part of a single company's financials and analyze their impact collectively.

But even then, the numbers like revenue growth at 16% in one tweet and 8% in another don't necessarily mean the stock is going up or down. It could depend on other factors, but since I can only choose between positive, neutral, or negative, I'll focus on the overall trend of each factor.

Let me list out the key points from each tweet:

1. First tweet: Sales and financial performance with various growth percentages.
2. Second tweet: EBITDA for a different company, maybe unrelated to the first.
3. Third tweet: Revenues and net income numbers, perhaps for another company.

If these are all related to different companies, then their impact on the stock of the given company isn't directly assessable from this data. But if they're part of the same context, I might have to assume that.

Alternatively, maybe each tweet is about a single company but in different quarters or periods, and there's some pattern or comparison between them.

Wait, perhaps it's meant to be all related to one company. So let me try to think: AT_USER, FPTM, TSLA... Maybe these are different companies from the same company?

No, AT_USER seems like an username, not a stock symbol. Similarly for FPTM and TSLA.

So perhaps each tweet is about different stock symbols in relation to the given company.

Alternatively, maybe all tweets are related to a single company but with multiple metrics or financial statements combined.

Since I don't have context on what these symbols represent, it's tricky. Maybe I can focus only on the data points provided and see if there's a pattern that suggests positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

Looking at each tweet:

1. Sales growth for multiple companies: 479m in revenue, 3.9b EBITDA... The numbers are all positive.
2. Different company metrics with different revenues.
3. More sales and net income numbers, again positive.

If the given company's stock symbols have these metrics with positive growths or declines, it might influence the sentiment. But without knowing what each symbol represents in relation to the given company, I can't make a precise judgment.

Perhaps the user expects me to note that all three are improving financial performance and just assume that collectively, it suggests an upward trend. So maybe the overall sentiment is positive.

But I'm not entirely sure because without context, this might be a stretch. Alternatively, if each tweet indicates positive numbers for different companies, it could indicate mixed signals or varied viewpoints.

Wait, maybe the given company is part of multiple segments or industries with different financials, so combining all these metrics could provide an overall picture.

But again, since I don't have that context, my analysis will be limited. I'll proceed by considering each tweet's data points and how they might relate to the stock price, but it's a bit speculative.

Each tweet has positive numbers like revenue growth at 16% and 8%. But then there are some negative percentages, like -49%, -23%, etc., which could be selling points or concerns.

So combining all these factors—positive numbers (like increasing sales), some negative numbers (reductions in sales or profits)—could suggest an overall mixed view. Without knowing the context of how each stock relates to the given company, it's hard to assess the sentiment accurately.

I think I'll go with a neutral stance because each tweet seems to present positive growth metrics but also includes some negative ones that could cancel each other out. Plus, without specific context about the stock symbols' performance on a broader scale, it's challenging to make a clear conclusion."
2015-02-08,Positive,"Okay, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for the impact on Amazon's stock price. The user has given two tweets, and I need to determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""harvest automation to compete with kiva systems $ amzn . URL"" It seems like it's mentioning a competitor or partnership, so that might be a positive sign because Amazon could gain market share. But the price symbol is $ amzn, which is different from actual stock symbols.

The second tweet says: ""our penny stock pick on $ suti closed up another 60 % friday ! get our next pick early : URL $ amzn $ qcom $ csco"" This looks like a referral code for Amazon and other companies. The mention of $ suti doesn't seem relevant here, but the fact that it's offering picks suggests potential growth, which is positive.

Putting these together, both tweets are about opportunities to get picked or refer to upcoming stocks. These opportunities could boost demand for Amazon, leading to higher stock prices. But since they're not directly related to a specific stock, I can't tell exactly what impact they have on the target stock. However, given the context of referral codes and potential increased trading volumes, it's likely positive.

So, after analyzing both tweets from the perspective of an investor looking for penny stocks, these seem to be pointers towards growth opportunities that Amazon could benefit from."
2015-02-09,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets about Amazon's stock and determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually.

First tweet: It says that $ amzn ""generates cash, which is more important than profits."" That sounds like Amazon is focusing on liquidity rather than profitability. I think that could be a positive because it might encourage investors to buy more since they're prioritizing short-term gains over long-term returns. So this seems positive.

Second tweet: It's just updating the date and some URL, nothing special here. Nothing stands out about this one, so maybe not much to say about its impact yet.

Third tweet: Mentioning John Lebere from a QA session on tech companies like iPhone 6, Amazon, Twitter, etc. The mention of these companies suggests they're discussing broader market trends rather than specific products or news about Amazon. This might indicate that the sentiment is more towards the overall market rather than Amazon itself, so it's probably neutral.

Fourth tweet: Says ""fundamental andDCF valuation URL."" Fundamental analysis looks at a company's fundamentals like financial health, whereas DCF stands for discounted cash flow. If they're talking about valuations using this method, it could mean that Amazon is looking at how to value its stock based on future earnings. That might be positive if investors are concerned with the stock's valuation relative to others.

Fifth tweet: Another URL without any specific info. It seems generic and not adding much new information beyond general market context. So maybe this isn't influencing the sentiment much.

Sixth tweet: Talks about market caps across different companies. It mentions alibaba, facebook, and amazon with tweets from them. This is just updating the market's size among competitors but doesn't directly relate to Amazon's stock or its financial performance. So probably not a significant impact.

Seventh tweet: Discusses the launch of a new dish network called Sling TV reaching a deal with AMC. That could be positive if it's a strategic move for Amazon, possibly attracting customers or increasing brand visibility. But I'm not sure if this directly relates to stock performance yet.

Eighth tweet: Covers the staples or office depot merger, mentioning considerations. This seems like a specific event that might impact Amazon if there are significant changes in operations or products. However, without more context on what those merges involve or their potential effect on Amazon's financials, it's hard to assess the sentiment immediately.

Putting it all together: There are three positive tweets (1, 4), a neutral one (3), and five neutral/tentative ones. The only negative could be if any tweet contradicts the others, but none seem to point that out. So overall, there's some positive influence from these tweets."
2015-02-10,Negative,"Alright, I'm looking at these tweets and need to figure out their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me break it down step by step.

First, there's #AT_USER with a tweet announcing fake processors sold via certain URLs. That sounds like a problem because fake hardware can affect user trust and could lead to legal issues for Amazon, which is involved in these transactions. I think this might lower investor confidence, making the stock price more negative.

Then, the second tweet mentions moving open positions into stocks like APT, IC, TSLA, etc., but it doesn't specify a direction or impact on the market. It seems like it's providing some investment opportunities without any explicit positive or negative statements. So, this could be a bit of both, maybe neutral.

I should consider each tweet individually. The first one is clearly bad news for Amazon, so that's probably negative. The second one looks like just informational content without affecting market sentiment much. Combining these, the overall impact might be negative because the main issue is the fake processors."
2015-02-11,Neutral,"Alright, I'm looking at this query where the user wants me to analyze some tweets and determine their impact on a stock's future price. The response needs to be either positive, neutral, or negative.

First, let's break down what they provided. There are two tweets given, but each one seems like a single tweet because of the URL formatting. I'm assuming these are individual tweets meant to analyze each one separately.

Starting with the first tweet: ""rt exclusive via AT_USER trouble for AT_USER prime's two-day deliveries ? URL $ amzn URL."" This looks like an email or maybe a call from a user, specifically mentioning Amazon. The mention of two-day deliveries is interesting; it could be about their shipping service. But I don't see any positive or negative indicators here. It's just a casual message.

Now the second tweet: ""helpful video for stock options beginners ! ! URL $ goog $ aapl $ googl $ amzn $ fb $ feye $ fxcm URL."" Again, this seems to be another email offering a helpful video on stock options basics. It doesn't mention any positive or negative sentiment towards the stock price. It's just an educational message aimed at new investors.

Putting them together, both tweets are casual promotional messages from users promoting Amazon and Google respectively. They don't provide any information about the company's performance, financial health, or anything that would sway investor sentiment. The user is asking for a stock's future impact based on these tweets, but neither tweet gives any concrete data or analysis.

Therefore, without any positive words, negative indicators, or any form of engagement towards the stock price itself, it's clear that there's no clear trend here. Both are just emails promoting services to interested parties. So, I think the overall sentiment is neutral because there's no indication of a favorable or unfavorable outcome based on these tweets."
2015-02-12,Neutral,"Alright, I'm looking at this query where the user wants to analyze the impact of some tweets on a company's stock price and determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative.

First, the target stock is sogotrade. The tweets provided include a mention of several companies: $apl, $c, $iyr, $ewa, $amzn, etc. I notice that most of these are large technology companies, which is interesting for my analysis because their performance can be quite volatile.

Looking at each tweet one by one:

1. The first tweet says ""just released ! sogotrade ’ s morning call on today’s spotlight stocks $ aapl , $ c , $ iyr , $ ewa , $ amzn , $ aapl , $ gsh , $ yge url"". It's talking about their performance and upcoming stock prices. This seems to outline the company's prospects for the day, which is useful but not directly impacting the stock price.

2. The next tweet reiterates the spotlight stocks again, repeating the same information. This repetition might indicate that the user has reviewed these tweets multiple times or there's some engagement with them, possibly from their customers or analysts.

3. The following tweets are all about ""sogotrade ’ s morning call on today’s spotlight stocks"". Each one just repeats the same phrase without any new information. It seems like it's a consistent source of updates on their stock performance.

Putting this together, each tweet is reinforcing the company's current status. They're providing financial updates, spotlights for upcoming trades, and mentions of key competitors. This could be helpful for investors as they might use this to gauge the company's direction or make informed decisions about trading strategies.

However, since all the tweets are focused on their performance metrics without any positive reinforcement or warnings about issues, it doesn't indicate improvement in their financial health or upcoming moves. It also doesn't suggest any negative news impacting them.

Therefore, considering the overall impact from a neutral perspective, these tweets don't provide any positive signals but rather just repeat information that might be useful for current investors to stay informed."
2015-02-13,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First tweet: "". AT_USER h5 universal cpu cooler review $ amzn , $ amd URL URL"". It looks like it's adding some reviews and mentions URLs. Maybe it's about product reviews, so that could be positive because people are talking about their devices.

Second tweet: ""closed $ amzn position from $ 310"". This seems to indicate that Amazon is selling its stock price down by a certain amount. That's definitely negative news for the company.

Third tweet: ""$ amzn : URL inc . ( amzn ): can the trend continue ? : URL"" It uses URLs, but the main message here is about whether the trend will continue. If it says ""can the trend continue?"" followed by an emoji, that suggests some optimism or uncertainty in how the market might react.

Fourth tweet: ""$ amzn حاول أن يكون التحليلivities 1 + 1 = 2 URL"". It translates to ""Amazon is aiming for a position where 1+1=2"" which seems like a playful and perhaps positive statement, maybe indicating confidence or a certain approach in their operations.

Now, I need to combine these thoughts. The first tweet adds more info about Amazon's products. The second tweet shows a stock price move, which is a huge negative. The third tweet has an emoji suggesting uncertainty but could imply potential improvement. The fourth tweet is playful and positive.

Overall, there are mixed emotions. Positive elements like product reviews and the humorous statement suggest optimism, but the major negative tweet about the stock closing down significantly might outweigh that. So, I think the overall sentiment leans towards Neutral."
2015-02-14,Positive,"Alright, I'm looking at these tweets and trying to figure out how they might affect the stock price of a company. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the user has provided four tweets. Each tweet seems to be related to investing or stock news. My task is to determine if each tweet leads to positive, neutral, or negative impact on the stock's future price.

Starting with the first tweet: ""is the consumer ready to make a comeback in 2015 ?"" This one doesn't seem like it's directly about the company's stock performance. It's more of an opinion poll about consumers. I don't see any positive or negative indicators here, so maybe this tweet is neutral.

Next is the second tweet: ""defennyt : fxi insider roster $ fxi $ pbr $ twtr $ tza $ amzn buy URL."" The word ""buy"" here suggests that people are interested in buying shares of Amazon. This could indicate a positive sentiment as investors might be pulling their money into the stock to capitalize on any upcoming opportunities.

The third tweet is more business-oriented: ""if you are a trader grexit doesnt matter easy market in jan + feb . we nailed it big time here . $ spy $ nflx $ amzn $ lnkd $ cvx all big winners ."" This seems to mention the global economic situation, specifically related to the Brexit issue. It's talking about a successful market performance and mentions several companies like SPY (Spy), NFLX, AMZN, LNK, CVX. These are major tech or consumer stocks. The idea here is that the overall market is strong and there's optimism in upcoming quarters, which could lead to positive stock performance.

The fourth tweet: ""lookn 4wins : amzn +1.24 % stock charts $ amzn URL inc . URL"" indicates that Amazon's stock has gone up by 1.24%. This is a direct positive indicator of the company's performance and confidence in its future, which would likely boost the stock price.

Now, looking at each tweet individually:

1. The first tweet is about consumer sentiment but doesn't mention any specific stock metrics or predictions, so neutral.
2. The second tweet mentions buying shares, which suggests interest from investors, positive.
3. The third tweet talks about a strong market performance due to global events, indicating optimism and potential positive impact.
4. The fourth tweet shows an increase in the stock price by 1.24%, directly supporting the company's future.

Combining all these thoughts: The second tweet has direct buying interest, which is good for sentiment. The third tweet is about a strong market due to global factors. The fourth tweet is a clear positive news point. Although the first tweet is neutral in content, it doesn't provide any specific signal. So overall, the company is expected to have a positive impact because of the buy interest and the upcoming strong market performance mentioned."
2015-02-15,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of a company. I have four tweets provided, and each mentions different stocks like APOLY, TSLA, SPY, etc., which are all companies in the tech sector.

First, looking at each tweet individually might help me understand what's going on here. The user wants me to summarize each one as [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. I need to look for any positive mentions of stock increases, negatives like stock decreases or declines, and neutral statements that don't affect sentiment much.

Starting with the first tweet: ""100k challenge is on . are you in ? URL $ aapl $ tsla $ spy $ iwm $ fb $ pcln $ lnkd $ googl $ goog $ qqq $ dia $ iwm $ amzn $ nflx"". Hmm, this seems like it's talking about challenges and maybe some company names. The words ""100k challenge"" don't directly indicate positive or negative stock info. Maybe the user is listing different companies or products? I'm not sure if that affects the overall sentiment of any specific stock.

Moving to the second tweet: ""$ yhoo $ amzn $ fb $ v presidents weekend reads - update from option millionaires record cold , record snow , and record ... URL"". This tweet mentions YHOO, AMZN, FB, and some stuff about presidents. The ""millionaires"" part seems positive with a lot of excitement, which might indicate that people are looking ahead or planning for the future, but does that directly impact stock prices? Maybe it could mean investor confidence, which is generally positive.

Third tweet: ""how to analyze the options chain URL $ amzn $ fb $ twtr"". It's about analyzing an options chain. While this doesn't mention any stocks, perhaps it's advising on how to do something related to stock trading. Since I'm trying to predict stock prices based on general trends, maybe this is too vague or not relevant for the specific stock being analyzed.

Fourth tweet: ""rt : URL webinar free 1 - hour class on introduction to options URL $ amzn $ fb $ twtr"". Again, it's talking about a webinar introducing options trading. Similar to the third tweet, since it doesn't specify any particular stock, just mentioning trading strategies, I'm not sure how that would impact the stock price unless there are specific mentions of a company.

Lastly, ""cvd.to stock chart $ cvd.to $ amzn $ rusl $ bno URL URL"". This seems to be referencing a stock chart and specific stocks. It might be asking about current stock performance or trends, but without any positive or negative keywords related to the stock price changes themselves, it's hard to assess the impact on that particular company.

Putting this all together, none of these tweets directly mention a specific stock unless they are talking about AMZN multiple times. For example, tweet 2 mentions AMZN and others, which might indicate investor sentiment about tech generally. Since I don't have real-time data or direct information about AMZN's performance from the provided tweets, it's hard to say for sure. It could be that people are more confident in tech companies due to economic trends or other factors, but without concrete data points, my analysis remains neutral."
2015-02-16,Negative,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company, and figure out if it's positive, neutral, or negative. The user provided three tweets, but looking at them closely, they seem to be part of a tweet stream rather than individual tweets. Hmm, let me check that first.

The first tweet is: ""tickers trending on twtr in last 1 hour $ amex $ dax $ tsla $ amzn $ nasdaq URL"". That sounds like it's categorizing stocks related to TWTR within the next hour. But each subsequent tweet doesn't seem to be separate from this initial one; instead, they follow ""via AT_USER"" or mention other companies. So, maybe these tweets are part of a follow-up series.

Next, the second tweet: ""shot down : faa drone regulations deal blow to AT_USER ( but this dance ain't over ) URL via AT_USER $ amzn"". It mentions regulators dealing with drones and launches a video about AT_USER stock. The word ""blow"" suggests a negative impact on sentiment, so that might be a problem.

Third tweet: ""rt AT_USER weekend review video : $ spy $ iwm $ qqq $ tlt $ gld $ aapl $ amzn $ axp $ baba $ bidu $ fb $ twtr $ feye $ googl $ msft $ pcln $ tsla ht …"". It's another link to stock info from AT_USER. The mention of ""review video"" could imply positive information, but the context is unclear.

Since these are part of a follow-up tweet stream, each tweet influences the sentiment based on the company's responses or mentions. The second tweet has a clear negative note about regulators handling a problem, which likely reduces investor confidence. The first and third tweets mention stock names but without specific details might not have immediate impact. So, overall sentiment is probably negative because of that negative tweet.

I'm not sure if ""via AT_USER"" links are part of the actual posts or just placeholders. If they are real posts from AT_USER, then each tweet adds to the sentiment. But since it's unclear, I'll go with the most impactful one as negative."
2015-02-17,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and figure out if they'll affect the stock price for Amazon. Let me start by breaking it down.

First, looking at the tweet: ""$ amzn : will URL ( amn ) stock be affected today by faa's view of ... : URL"". Hmm, that seems a bit off-topic. It mentions ""URL"" which is usually related to URLs or internet links, not something directly tied to Amazon's stock. Maybe it's part of some typo or formatting issue.

Next, I think about the structure they're using: [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Since the tweet doesn't seem relevant at all—nothing to do with the stock or the company—it might be neutral because there's no direct information that affects Amazon's future performance.

Also, the mention of ""faa's view"" is unclear and possibly a typo. Maybe it's supposed to be something related to their financial performance? But without specific information about what faa means here, it's hard to assess sentiment.

Considering all this, I don't think the tweet provides any useful info about Amazon or its stock price. It might have been designed as a filler message, not an actual insight into the company's future. So my conclusion is neutral."
2015-02-18,Positive,"Okay, so I need to determine the likely impact on Amazon's stock price based on the given tweets. Let me go through each tweet one by one and analyze them step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol, which is AMZN. 

Starting with the first tweet: "" $ amzn $ bac $ bidu $ ua charts and more … - update from option millionaires it's getting late and before i call it a n ... URL"" Hmm, this seems like a link or a link to something else. I'm not sure what that is here, but maybe it's a placeholder for future information. So, no immediate impact on AMZN.

Second tweet: "" rt AT_USER google capital sets sights on india . $ goog , $ ms , $ amzn . URL URL"" This mentions Google (GOOG), Microsoft (MS), and Amazon. It talks about Google focusing on India, which is a significant company in the US market. However, I'm not sure how this directly affects AMZN. It might be a sign of investor interest or a strategy, but it's more related to competitors rather than stock price changes.

Third tweet: ""$ ups $ amzn news : "" will be facing much higher shipping costs even with lower ... "" URL board view : URL"" This seems like an announcement from Amazon about increased shipping costs despite lower revenues. Shipping costs can impact the company's margins and potentially affect profitability, which might lead to stock price changes.

Fourth tweet: "" amazon prime now expands to all of manhattan , one-hour delivery for $ 8 $ amzn nyc URL"" This mentions expanding Amazon Prime in Manhattan with a one-hour delivery service. This is a strategic move for Amazon, which could improve customer satisfaction and revenue, but again, more about expanding the business rather than directly impacting AMZN's stock price.

Fifth tweet: "" bosch + AT_USER & boom $ amzn explodes into stellar original content . hey $ nflx & hbo objs in mirror r closer than u think"" This is talking about Bose (BA) and other companies collaborating with Amazon, creating new content. It seems like a promotional move for expansion or partnerships, which can be positive but also part of broader market trends.

Now, compiling the factors: Positive factors might include increased shipping costs, potential expansion into new markets, and promotional content. Negative factors aren't immediately clear except maybe the strategic business moves in the fourth and fifth tweets could boost AMZN's performance if seen positively by investors.

Assessing sentiment based on these factors: The higher shipping costs are a concern for profit margins, which can negatively impact AMZN's stock price. However, Amazon has been expanding their business and collaborating with others, which is generally positive for growth. Plus, strategic partnerships might be an indicator of confidence in the company's future.

Considering all the positive points like expansion into new markets (Manhattan) and promotional content (stellar original content), these seem to suggest a favorable overall sentiment. The negative factor from shipping costs is minor compared to the other factors. Therefore, I think the stock is likely to rise."
2015-02-19,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

First, there's a URL price target raised to $475.00 for Amazon. That sounds like a strategic move by management to influence investor sentiment. Price targets can sometimes be leveraged to manipulate market expectations.

Next, the tweet mentions that Amazon is getting close to a key breakout level and will follow if the market turns green. Breakout levels are common signals in technical analysis where an index breaks through support or resistance. If the market turns green (upward), it could indicate positive news, which might push Amazon's stock higher.

The third tweet provides a price movement of +4.87 for AMZN over 1 hour starting at 8:00 am on February 19th, navigating between NASDAQ and the S&P 500 with SPY. This is a live price change within a few hours, which suggests that Amazon's stock is moving in a trend.

The fourth tweet talks about a forum update for SUTI on Thursday, February 19, 2015, at 6:41 am, mentioning companies like DKTs and AMZN. This could be an event related to the company, potentially influencing its performance and investor sentiment over time.

Then there's a tweet about JWN not denying business success but spending too much to achieve it. The mention of both Amazon Cloud and Google is interesting; it might relate to revenue growth or future expansion plans, affecting current stock performance.

Lastly, another mention of AMZN vs NFLX (which I think is Facebook Inc.), GM, and Microsoft. This could be indicating that Amazon's shares are competing with other companies in their sector, which might affect investor sentiment if there's competition.

Now, considering all these points: price targets can influence expectations; breaking levels suggest potential upward movement; live price changes indicate current trend; forum updates relate to events happening, which can signal future performance. The mention of both Amazon Cloud and Google suggests a strategic approach with expanded reach, possibly impacting revenue or market share. However, the direct mentions like ""spending too much"" could lead to negative sentiment if it affects profit margins, but maybe not immediately. The competition with other tech companies might have mixed effects.

Putting this all together, the price target is an immediate action by management. The break level suggests potential future gains. Live prices indicate current trends, and the forum updates could be related or unrelated. The mention of both cloud services and Google suggests a broader strategy. So, overall sentiment seems positive but there's some uncertainty due to possible market reactions from other factors."
2015-02-20,Positive,"Okay, so I have to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me break down how I should approach this.

First, I need to figure out what each tweet is saying. From what I can see, the user provided a list of tweets, but they’re not in a clear structure or any specific context. Some are about earnings reports, others are about stock reviews and updates.

Starting with the first tweet: ""the stock picking service of 2014 watch this ! here URL .. $ amzn $ mcox $ goog"". It mentions the AMZN stock symbol and links to other companies, but it's not clear what they're implying. Maybe a stock-picking service is advising readers on which stocks to buy, so that could influence investor sentiment positively.

The second tweet: ""URL daily round up 2/18 / 15 : advanced drainage systems , applied industrial t ... URL $ ait $ alco $ amzn"". Again, it's linking to other companies but not giving much context about AMZN. It seems like just general information.

Third tweet: ""rt AT_USER new blog post : the "" earnings gappers "" watchlist : URL : $ aapl , $ amzn , $ csiq , $ feye , $ ba , $ panw , $ cy …"". This one is talking about earnings gaps, which could be positive or negative depending on whether they're good. If there are earnings gappers, maybe investors expect them to rise, so that's a positive sign.

Fourth tweet: ""$ intc reviews updated friday , february 20 , 2015 watch list - update from option millionaires | stock options chatroom | cal ... URL"". It mentions the INTC stock, which is another company. If there have been recent reviews updating, that might affect investor sentiment for other stocks.

Fifth tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ amzn if makes new high and can hold 384 should see 387.70 next target"". This seems like a tip or forecast from Twitter, suggesting AMZN's price might go up. If the user thinks AMZN is on the right track, that could be positive news.

Sixth tweet: ""$ yhoo $ amzn $ fb $ v february 20th , 2015 watch list - update from option millionaires | stock options chatroom | cal ... URL"". Similar to the fourth tweet, it's about another company, FB or YHOO. If there have been recent updates on these stocks, they could impact AMZN positively if they're related.

Seventh tweet: ""rt AT_USER the end of the department store URL $ amzn $ anf $ aro $ jcp $ m $ shld $ tgt"". This seems like another Twitter user commenting on stock performance. If it's positive, it might boost AMZN.

Eighth tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ ba $ de $ fb $ twtr $ yhoo $ amzn $ sbux"". Again, multiple companies mentioned, but not tying them directly to AMZN.

So, overall, some tweets are about upcoming earnings reports or other companies, which could influence investor sentiment on AMZN. The third tweet specifically mentions ""earnings gappers,"" which might be a positive sign. The fifth and sixth tweets predict future price movements for other companies related to AMZN. 

Putting it all together, these tweets seem to provide various pieces of information that are relevant to investors looking at AMZN, both as factors and predictions. Positive trends in other companies could influence the stock positively.

Therefore, considering all these points, I think the overall sentiment is positive because there are indicators and forecasts suggesting potential growth and support for AMZN."
2015-02-21,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First tweet: "" $ amzn stock message board updated saturday , february 21 , 2015 07:03 : 22 am $ wmt $ ewj $ hd $ cohu URL"" Hmm, that's not clear. It looks like it's just setting a date and some stock names on the stock message board. I'm not sure what this is referring to. Maybe it's about something like a market update or an analysis? Without more context, it's hard to tell if it's positive, negative, or neutral. Maybe I should leave that one aside for now.

Second tweet: "" $ amzn stock message board updated saturday , february 21 , 2015 07:03 : 22 am $ wmt $ ewj $ hd $ cohu url"" Wait a minute, this looks similar to the first one. It's also setting an update on the stock message board with some stock names and a URL. Same issue as the first tweet—no clear information about the impact. I'm not sure what this tweet is trying to convey either.

Third tweet: "" Amazon (AMZN) is a leading global technology company, delivering services that drive digital transformation across all industries. It's one of the world's most respected companies and has revolutionized many industries around the globe. AMZN has been on a trajectory toward innovation and growth for years, with strong revenue and profit margins that have driven its stock price to historic highs. The company continues to set new records in these areas and has demonstrated resilience in navigating various market conditions.""

Okay, this one seems more positive. It's discussing Amazon's reputation as a leader, emphasizing their success, revenue growth, and innovation. Positive language about their strengths sounds good for a positive impact on the stock price.

Fourth tweet: ""Amazon (AMZN) is an American company located in the United States with offices around the world. The company prides itself on providing top-tier products at competitive prices that drive customer satisfaction and long-term growth. Amazon has made significant progress in its mission, which includes building a globally competitive marketplace."" This also sounds positive. It's talking about their leadership, quality of products, and focus on customers and growth. That reinforces the idea of a strong company with potential for positive stock price.

Fifth tweet: ""Amazon is one of the world's leading technology companies in the global market. They dominate industries such as e-commerce, cloud computing, software development, healthcare, entertainment, and consumer goods. The company has also been making significant strides toward innovation, improving customer experiences through cutting-edge technologies and services that have set new standards for excellence."" This is another positive tweet. It's highlighting Amazon's leadership across various industries, their focus on technology innovation, and customer-focused approaches. These all contribute to a positive outlook on the stock.

Putting it all together: The first two tweets are unclear but may not provide much information. The third, fourth, and fifth tweets are all positive in nature. However, since the target stock symbol is Amazon (AMZN), I should focus more on their recent performance. But without clear sentiment from the first two tweets, maybe they're just placeholders or typos.

So, considering only the tweets that provide relevant information about Amazon's performance: The third tweet talks about innovation and growth, which are good signs for a positive stock price. The fourth and fifth tweets also emphasize leadership and customer focus, both of which can boost a company's reputation and thus its stock price.

Therefore, despite the first two tweets being unclear, the overall sentiment seems to be positive."
2015-02-22,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether these tweets will impact the stock price of a given company in the future, and then decide if it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me start by understanding each tweet.

First tweet: ""AT_USER $ amzn your tweet has been featured on the newest market trending app , market parse , for iphone . URL"" – Hmm, I'm not entirely sure what AT_USER is referring to here. It seems like it's a username, maybe? But without context, it's hard to tell. Maybe it's a typo or part of the tweet title.

Second tweet: ""rt AT_USER nasdaq - then and now notice big differences in p / es and the composition $ aapl $ fb $ amzn $ gild $ amgn $ googl $ msft URL"" – This seems like a comparison between NASDAQ (which is a stock exchange) and other companies. The word ""p/es"" might be referring to P/E ratio, which measures how expensive a company's stock is relative to its earnings. If the ratios are big differences, it could indicate conflicting growth or financial performance across different companies.

Now, thinking about each tweet: 

In the first tweet, if AT_USER isn't clear, maybe it's just random text with URLs and mentions. That might not contribute much to sentiment analysis. On the second tweet, the mention of P/E ratio differences suggests concerns about market performance or financial health. High P/E ratios can indicate concern because investors are expecting higher valuations, which sometimes leads to negative sentiment if expectations aren't met.

Considering both tweets together: The first is more about the content being featured on a trending app related to tech companies like iPhone and Apple (AAPL), Amazon, etc. This could be positive because it's engaging with the market. However, the second tweet introduces financial metrics that some investors might find alarming or concerning. 

So putting it together, the first tweet is more about the company's current activity on a platform (positive) but introduces more investor concern in the second. The overall sentiment would probably lean towards [Negative] because while the company is being actively mentioned and potentially seen as a competitor, the mention of financial metrics like P/E ratios might lead to negative feelings among investors."
2015-02-23,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, each tweet seems to be focused on different topics related to Amazon and its competitors. 

Looking at the first two tweets, they mention something about a position leading the open interest on Twitter with a URL. That could imply increased investor interest or focus in the stock, which might boost sentiment positively.

The third tweet talks about millennials investing due to tech stocks. Since millenials are a significant demographic and investing in technology companies is often part of their financial strategies, this could be a positive factor. It suggests a trend among younger investors, which can have a positive impact on Amazon's growth potential.

Next, the fourth tweet provides a valuation analysis using financial ratios like valuation, debt, and liquidity. Such information can influence investor sentiment by showing what kind of value Amazon is offering. A valuation analysis could attract more attention and investment from potential buyers, contributing positively to the stock price.

Finally, the fifth tweet mentions S&P 500 trends across various stocks including AMZN. While not specific to AMZN alone, mentioning broader market trends can influence investor sentiment towards a particular company by affecting their overall view on the market.

So, each tweet is either discussing general trends or highlighting factors that might positively impact Amazon's future performance. Combining these elements suggests that there are multiple positive factors contributing to an optimistic outlook for the stock price."
2015-02-24,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The task is to determine whether a tweet about the impact on stock prices for a company would lead to a positive, neutral, or negative outcome based on the provided tweets.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at the given tweet: ""$ ibm $ amzn $ msft $ crm $ wday"". The words ""ibm"", ""amzn"", ""msft"", and ""crm"" are all company names, so it's probably about Amazon (AMZN). The word ""wday"" might refer to a specific date or event related to Amazon.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one. Wait, there's only one tweet here: ""$ ibm $ amzn $ msft $ crm $ wday : ibm employee count falls for second year in transition to cloud : URL"". 

So, the relevant factors here are ""ibm"", ""amzn"", ""msft"" (which is AMZN), and ""crm"" which might be a company name. The main part of the tweet mentions that IBM's employee count has fallen for the second year in a transition to the cloud.

Now, I need to assess each relevant factor. 

1. IBM: It's mentioned as having employee numbers falling, which could indicate a decline in workforce. This might affect financial performance and hence investor sentiment.
2. AMZN (Amazon): There's no direct mention of Amazon here; it's only a part of the stock symbol. So perhaps this is about Amazon, but the tweet isn't directly mentioning it yet.
3. MSFT: Similarly, Microsoft would be another company. The tweet doesn't state anything about them directly.
4. CRM: This could refer to Microsoft or another company as well.

The key point here is the ""employee count falls for second year in transition to cloud."" Cloud companies like AWS and Azure are expanding their operations, which can be good signs of growth. However, a decrease in employees might indicate underperformance or perhaps more focused on cost-cutting, which could affect profitability.

Considering all this, I think the employee count falling is likely a positive sign for the company as it suggests efficiency and possibly better management. This trend would generally lead to an improvement in financial health, thereby boosting investor confidence.

Putting it all together, each tweet is separate, so we have four tweets contributing to the analysis. However, only one of them (the first) is relevant because the others don't mention a specific company except AMZN and MSFT.

Since IBM's employee count falling indicates positive trends in cloud adoption, which is favorable for Amazon and likely beneficial to its parent company as well, the overall sentiment should be positive."
2015-02-25,Negative,"Alright, so I need to figure out how to determine the impact on Amazon's stock price based on these tweets. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll extract the target stock from each tweet. I see several tweets mentioning AMZN, FB, WMT, etc., but since I don't have all the information, I can only work with what I get. Each tweet has different factors and sentiments.

Looking at the first tweet: ""$ tgt $ amzn : target q4 earnings jump , but q1 guidance is light tgt wmt : URL"". This seems like a general update about AMZN's expectations for Q4 earnings, which could influence investor sentiment. But without knowing what tgt stands for or if it's an ongoing project, I can't be sure. It might be neutral because it's just a projection.

Second tweet: ""$ some of the names from yesterdays video moving nicely $ pcln $ fb $ amzn URL URL"". This is more about video names and not directly related to AMZN. Maybe this isn't relevant enough for a stock analysis, so I can't conclude much here.

Third tweet: ""$ amzn flag pattern , if holds , atleast gives you 397 .."" Here, the user is talking about a potential offer or deal for Amazon, which could be positive because it might attract buyers. The word ""flag pattern"" and offering seem like good signs, so this seems positively impacting.

Fourth tweet: ""$ bot apr 400 calls $ amzn"" – This sounds like a call alert from someone using Twitter's bot to sell AMZN shares. Negative news about a trade could hurt the stock, especially if it's unrelated to Amazon's profitability or fundamentals.

Fifth tweet: ""$ amzn to the moon"" – A humorous statement that doesn't provide any information about the stock. It might be seen as an unexpected and positive message, but without context, it's hard to tell.

Sixth tweet: ""$ 21 financial mistakes that endanger gen xers ' future URL via AT_USER $ wmt $ amzn URL"" – This mentions financial issues affecting Gen Xers' future, which could be negative. It suggests potential risks or problems with the economy that might affect Amazon's stock.

Seventh tweet: ""$ rt AT_USER financialcrisis a failure in government . the crash didn't occur cause $ amzn p / e - swaps were legal insurance [ fraud ] - know …"" This is a serious financial crisis mentioned by AT_USER. The mention of financial crisis would likely lead to negative sentiment, as investors are concerned about stability and recovery.

Now, compiling all this: I see both positive (flag offers) and negative (financial crises, government issues). There's also a tweet about April 400 calls for Amazon, which could be negative if related to geopolitical events. But the main point is the financial crisis mentioned in the seventh tweet, which suggests significant risks. Without more context from the other tweets, the overall sentiment might lean towards [Negative] because of the major issue."
2015-02-26,Neutral,"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I have four tweets related to Amazon and some other factors, and I need to determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. The task is to analyze each tweet for positive or negative factors and overall sentiment.

First, I'll start by extracting the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at each tweet:

1. ""rt AT_USER $ pcln $ cmg $ sam $ mcd $ amzn $ nflx"" – This one only mentions a few symbols: $pcln, $ cmg, $ sam, $ mcd, and $ amzn. The URL is $ nflx, which stands for NFLX. So the target stock is NFLX.

2. ""rt AT_USER former white house press secretary jay carney's new job : working at amazon . URL $ amzn URL"" – This tweet mentions Jay Carney from the White House and his new job being with Amazon. The main content seems to be about the company and its URL, but not directly related to a stock symbol.

3. ""sorry , biometrics alone will not be replacing the password $ amzn URL URL"" – Here, ""amzn"" is mentioned in the URL: $ amzn URL URL. This might indicate that people are concerned about Amazon's security or something related to passwords being replaced by biometrics. So, a negative factor.

4. ""$ amzn news : "" 2 internet etfs flexing their muscles $ fdn $ pnqi $ amzn $ bidu $ fb … "" URL board view : URL"" – This tweet starts with the target stock symbol: $ amzn. It's talking about internet ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) flexing their muscles, which could affect Amazon's performance through diversification. The word ""flexing"" might imply a positive factor if it suggests diversification or diversifying risk.

5. ""rt AT_USER $ amzn apr . 17 , 2015 call 400.00 : +2.872 contracts add to oi"" – This tweet mentions the stock price of Amazon on April 17, 2015, saying it called and saw a rise. The change is +2.872 in price, but I'm not sure how significant this impact is relative to other factors.

Now, let's go through each tweet one by one for positive or negative factors:

1. ""cln"" probably stands for close on the stock exchange, indicating trading activity.
   - ""amzn"" is a target stock symbol, which is likely positive as it's related to Amazon.

2. The content here is about Jay Carney, so I don't see any direct information about a stock here.

3. The tweet mentions that biometrics are not replacing passwords, implying security concerns. This could be negative if it affects the company's reputation or customer trust, but since it's just a general statement and doesn't mention an action like reducing prices or increasing revenue, I'm unsure of its impact on Amazon's stock price.

4. The tweet talks about internet ETFs flexing their muscles, which might mean diversifying their portfolio. If they're getting more exposure to these ETFs through holdings in the company, it could be a positive factor as it adds risk and potentially diversification benefits, even though it's just talking about ETFs.

5. This tweet is a news event, so I don't have specific information on its impact unless there are recent news related to Amazon. The price change is +2.872, but without context, it's hard to assess the overall sentiment for the stock.

Next, I'll analyze each tweet in terms of positive and negative factors:

1. Positive: mentions NFLX.
   - So, at least one positive factor.

2. No clear information about a stock here.

3. Negative: mentions biometrics security but no direct impact on a stock.

4. Positive: suggests diversification through ETFs, which could have an effect on stock prices, even though it's just a statement without specific data.

5. News event with a price change, not necessarily affecting the stock directly unless there are recent earnings or something.

Now, I need to evaluate each tweet's overall impact:

1. Positive factor (Nflx) and no negative factors. So, positive sentiment for NFLX.

2. No information on any factor related to a stock. Neutral.

3. Negative factor (biometrics), so negative sentiment.

4. Positive factor (diversification through ETFs). If diversification is beneficial, it could be considered positive even if just a statement.

5. News event with a price change but no indication of impact on the stock. It's ambiguous; perhaps neutral or slight negative if Amazon's fundamentals are affected, but given the lack of context, I'll treat it as neutral.

Finally, combining all factors:

- Positive tweets: 1 and 4.
- Negative tweet: 3.
- Neutral tweet: 2.

But wait, the question is about the stock of a specific company. If the target stock isn't mentioned in the tweets, we can't analyze its impact. However, in this case, the first tweet includes ""fmcd"", which might be another symbol for the same company or different one. But given the data provided, I only have one relevant stock symbol: NFLX.

So, overall sentiment based on the positive and negative factors:

- Positive tweets: 1 and 4.
- Negative tweet: 3.
- Neutral tweet: 2.

Since there are two positive factors (1 and 4) and one negative factor (3), it's leaning towards a mixed result. However, without more context from other tweets or a larger dataset, it's hard to make an exact conclusion. But based on the given information:

Positive (1 and 4), Negative (3), Neutral (2).

But since I have only three tweets, maybe it's better to consider each tweet individually for sentiment:

- Tweet 1: Positive
- Tweet 2: None relevant to a stock
- Tweet 3: Negative
- Tweet 4: Positive
- Tweet 5: News event

So, in total, two positive, one negative. The overall impact is positive and slightly negative.

But the output requirement is to conclude with just ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"".

Given that there are positive and negative factors, I might have to consider the majority or the balance. But without a clear majority, it's ambiguous. However, since tweet 4 mentions ETFs and diversification, which could be beneficial, but not definitive.

Alternatively, perhaps tweet 4 is just a statement about diversification without any impact on stock performance, so neutral for that factor. Then overall:

Positive: 1,4
Negative:3
Neutral:2

So, overall sentiment is positive, negative, and neutral? Not sure how to combine this into one tag.

But the output must be one of [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Given that some are positive, some negative, it's unclear. Maybe I should look for the dominant factor.

Alternatively, perhaps tweet 4 is not providing specific information about Amazon's stock but more about diversification, which might have a neutral impact on price unless there are specific movements related to ETFs.

In conclusion, without additional context from other tweets or factors, it's challenging. But based solely on positive and negative factors, the sentiment leans towards neutral as tweet 3 is clearly negative, while 1,4 are positive, but one being slightly unclear. However, since tweet 2 doesn't mention a stock symbol, I can ignore it.

So, considering positive tweets:1,4; negative tweet:3. The impact is a mix, but leaning towards neutral because tweet 2 isn't relevant."
2015-02-27,Negative,"Okay, let's analyze these tweets to figure out how they impact Amazon's stock price. 

First, I need to identify each tweet and see if they have positive or negative factors. I'll go through them one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions patent applications for delivery trucks with 3D printers. This sounds like a positive sign because making things smarter can reduce costs and save money, which is good for the company's profitability.

2. The second tweet doesn't mention anything specific, but it's just general financials. However, since I don't have exact numbers or context, it's hard to say if this adds any significant information that would affect Amazon's stock. Maybe no factor here.

3. The third tweet talks about expanding a video game streaming site into poker. Video games can attract fans and boost revenue, so this seems like a positive outlook for the company.

4. Another repetition of point 1, same as tweet 1. It's redundant but reinforces the idea that patent applications are good news.

5. The fourth tweet is about former White House press secretary Jayney Carmney joining Amazon. That seems unrelated to their business operations or financials, so probably a neutral factor since it doesn't impact stock price directly.

6. This tweet suggests that Amazon is being threatened by a digital platform they're moving quickly with. Threatening could cause investors to worry about security or competition, which would be a negative factor.

7. Repeating point 3 again—expanding the game streaming site into poker sounds positive for future revenue and brand value.

8. Another repetition of point 3; no new information here.

9. The fourth tweet is another mention of patent applications, reinforcing the positive aspect but not adding anything new.

10. This tweet mentions a Kirk chart with data on AMZN performance. It doesn't provide specific numbers or context, so I can't assess the sentiment directly from this one.

11. The fifth tweet gives stock information at 1:47 PM. While it mentions a quote and price, there's no explicit statement about positive or negative factors affecting Amazon's stock. It might be neutral in that case.

Now, combining all these thoughts:

- Positive factors include patent applications (appearing multiple times), which is good.
- There are threats mentioned ( tweet 6 ), which could hurt the stock.
- Other tweets don't add significant information.

So, there's a mix of positive and negative. The threat from the digital platform seems like a major factor, but sometimes they might not be enough to outweigh other benefits Amazon has in their industry. 

I think the overall sentiment is leaning towards a neutral outcome because while Amazon has positive developments, one of their big threats isn't addressed yet."
2015-02-28,Positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out whether each tweet affects the stock price of Amazon for March 2015. Let me start by looking at each tweet separately.

The first tweet is ""$ amzn $ bac $ bidu $ ua unusual option action – live webinar – march 5th 2015 URL"". Hmm, it mentions Amazon's stock symbol (amzn) and some other symbols like bac and ua, which don't seem relevant. The mention of a live webinar on March 5th in 2015 is interesting. I'm not sure what that relates to regarding Amazon's stock performance.

Next tweet: ""Amazon.com is the world's second largest company by revenue."" That sounds positive because it's acknowledging Amazon as a major player, which usually boosts investor confidence and can increase stock prices.

Third tweet: ""$ apple $ net profit $ 2015 $ q3 $ for $ apple $"". Apple reported a Q3 profit in 2015. While that was a significant event, I'm not sure if it directly affects Amazon's future performance. It might have increased some investor confidence but doesn't specify the stock.

Fourth tweet: ""Amazon.com's e-commerce platform leads the pack globally."" This is positive as it highlights Amazon's dominance in online shopping, which can boost sales and brand reputation.

Fifth tweet: ""$ google $ search history $ 2015 $ q4 $ for $ google $"". Google's fourth quarter performance might affect Amazon indirectly through competition or market share but I don't have specific data on how that would impact Amazon.

Sixth tweet: ""Amazon.com has a strong international presence across regions with over 3,000 stores."" This is another positive statement about their reach, which could contribute to higher sales and brand visibility.

Putting it all together, the main positive points are Amazon's position as a major company, its e-commerce dominance, and strong international presence. The other tweets don't directly mention Amazon or have unclear implications. So overall, I think the stock is likely to be [Positive]."
2015-03-01,Missing,File not found
2015-03-02,Positive,"Alright, let's try to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon and NVIDIA (NFLX) stock. I'm going to break it down step by step.

First, looking at each tweet individually and then combining them into an overall sentiment summary.

Tweet 1: ""$ amzn $ nflx news : "" wedbush : netneutrality developments could be a positive for … "" URL board view : URL""

Hmm, this seems like a link to a blog post or something else. It's unclear what the content is about because of the URL format with dots and underscores, which might not be standard. I'm not sure what the sentiment here is—could it be neutral? Maybe, since without specific information on the blog post's content, it's hard to assess.

Tweet 2: ""p / e $ tsla $ amzn - $ nxpi 46 p / e $ nflx 111 p / e $ fb 71 p / e $ goog 27 p / e $ aapl 17 p / e""

This looks like multiple P/E ratios for different stocks. The fact that both Amazon and NVIDIA have lower P/E ratios compared to their peers is interesting, but without knowing the context of these numbers, it's hard to tell if this indicates positive or negative sentiment towards either company.

Tweet 3: ""squeeze plays like $ nflx and $ amzn have been working well recently . i'm holding off on entering positions at the open . patience is key""

This tweet seems more confident. It mentions that both NVIDIA and Amazon are performing well, advises holding onto stock without entering until the market recovers, and emphasizes patience. This positive outlook about their performance and potential recovery seems like a strong indicator of a positive sentiment.

Tweet 4: ""rt AT_USER “ AT_USER amazon has filed patent applications for delivery trucks with 3d printers : URL $ amzn ” AT_USER""

This tweet is more about the content they're creating, specifically patent applications. The link isn't to Amazon or NVIDIA's stock but to their product developments. This could be a positive note because innovation in technology can drive market growth, especially in areas like autonomous vehicles which might have implications for related companies. However, without direct information on how this affects the stocks' valuations, it's still speculative.

Now, combining all these thoughts: The user is optimistic about both companies' performance and potential future growth. They're suggesting that they should hold their positions once things improve, which is a positive action from someone with an eye on the stock market. Even though tweet 2 has lower P/E ratios, which can be seen as valuations, but combined with others indicating good news for tech sectors, it leans towards overall positive sentiment.

I think this suggests that there's a mixed view, but leaning more towards positive because of the strategic advice to hold and patience."
2015-03-03,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given tweets are positive, negative, or neutral in terms of their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by breaking down each tweet and analyzing them step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol. Both tweets mention ""AMZN,"" which is Amazon's ticker symbol, so that's clear. Now, I'll go through each tweet one by one.

The first tweet says: ""$ amzn you're not going to believe how amazon is going to speed up delivery URL."" Hmm, this seems a bit off. It mentions $ amzn and then talks about Amazon's future of delivery URLs. Wait, ""URL"" isn't a company name I know much about. Maybe it's a typo or something? But without more context, it's hard to tell what the user is implying here. The mention of faster delivery could be positive because faster delivery might mean better customer satisfaction and potentially lower prices for consumers.

The second tweet says: ""rt AT_USER amazon ’ s delivery innovations will be retailers ' worst nightmares $ amzn URL."" This one seems more concerning. It's using ""AT_USER"" to refer to Amazon's team, perhaps implying that their delivery innovations are causing problems for retailers. The phrase ""worst nightmares"" suggests that this is a major issue that could negatively affect Amazon's stock price because if their services cause problems for other companies, investors might be worried about Amazon's reliability.

So, combining these two tweets, the first one seems to have some positive elements related to faster delivery, but it's also unclear. The second tweet directly mentions retailers and says their nightmares, which is a strong negative indicator of how Amazon's innovations could impact others.

Now, looking at each tweet separately:

1. The first tweet has a mix of positive and ambiguous language. It might have some positive factors if they're talking about improved delivery systems or better customer service, but the mention of URL seems off-topic.
2. The second tweet is clearly negative because it's making a statement that could undermine Amazon's reputation by saying their innovations are problematic for retailers.

When combining both tweets, the negative sentiment from the second tweet outweighs any potential positive elements in the first tweet. Therefore, I would lean towards a negative overall sentiment on Amazon's stock."
2015-03-04,Neutral,"Alright, so I've got these tweets about Amazon and other companies. Let me try to figure out what's going on here.

First tweet is from someone mentioning the CIA control over the Washington Post and then making a URL with AT_USER mentions. That sounds like someone trying to be fake or trying to manipulate attention by using URLs. Maybe they're testing how people react to fake news? I'm not sure, but it seems like a risky tactic because it could just go unnoticed.

The second tweet is a response comment on a specific tweet about the iPhone. It's adding more context and praise for Amazon. So it seems like they're reinforcing the positive sentiment by expanding on the tweet or providing additional info without doing much else.

Third tweet mentions several retail companies with some low stock prices, including WMT, AMZN, KSS, etc., all with $ signs. That could be a concern because lower stock prices are generally bad news for investors. But it's not just about one company; it's multiple ones. Maybe the user is highlighting issues across sectors or perhaps they're making the companies look more promising? I'm not sure yet.

Fourth tweet brings up Netflix, specifically their NFLX ticker, and talks about a blog post where the analyst says ""Orange is the new black."" That phrase is usually seen as positive, suggesting that the stock might be doing well. People love seeing positive trends, so this could boost Amazon's sentiment.

Putting it all together: The first tweet could be manipulating attention or being fake, but in reality, it doesn't seem too harmful. The second tweet reinforces a positive comment and adds value. The third tweet is about companies, which might be unrelated if they're just listing names with stock prices. The fourth tweet boosts the sentiment because of that analyst quote.

So overall, there's both some positive comments from others and a mention of potential positive trends. Maybe the combination isn't too bad because it's reinforcing an already good trend."
2015-03-05,Negative,"Okay, so I have to analyze these tweets about Amazon and see how they impact the stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll identify each tweet's target stock symbol. The companies mentioned are Barnes & Noble, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Tesla, and Amazon. But wait, looking at the tweets, some are more about other companies like Facebook, Google (though I see that in multiple tweets), and others like Microsoft and Tesla.

Wait a minute, actually, let me list them out:

1. barnes & noble is betting big that a slimmer company can beat amazon URL $ bks $ amzn
2. now that is a presentation . good investment and tech insight too . $ am zn $ fb $ goog $ appl url
3. $ amzn news : "" should amazon ' leave ' china ? this firm suggests a stake in jd to … "" URL board view : URL
4. $ amzn $ googl : is url inc . ( amzn ) ' s rising app store a threat to google ... : URL
5. rt AT_USER handmade in brooklyn : etsy files for an ipo that could raise $ 300 million $ etsy $ am zn $ ebay $ baba $ ipo ipo url
6. $ amzn $ googl $ zzisk : kleiner boss of woman suing for bias once trumpeted ' male nerds ' : url

Wait, so Barnes & Noble is a company I know. Then Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, and others are mentioned as well. The target stock seems to be Amazon (AMZN), but let me check the URLs.

Looking at each tweet:

1. Barnes & Noble is focusing on beating Amazon.
2. Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon appear here.
3. Amazon is discussed in the third line about joining a board.
4. App Store issue by Amazon.
5. A YouTube user's post promoting an IPO.
6. Another tech company suing for bias.

So the target stock seems to be Amazon (AMZN) since it's mentioned multiple times, especially in points 3 and 4.

Now, I'll analyze each tweet to find positive or negative factors.

1. Barnes & Noble is betting on Amazon: This could make Amazon more attractive.
2. Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are all highlighted, which is good for investors.
3. The user mentions JD joining Amazon, so their stake is a factor.
4. App Store letters cause a problem; bad news for Amazon's app store service.
5. A big IPO by a tech company could be positive but maybe controversial.
6. Another tech company suing because of bias – but this seems less related.

Now, let me assess the sentiment:

- Barnes & Noble's bet on Amazon is positive.
- Apple, Microsoft, Google are all major tech companies with positive impacts on AMZN.
- JD joining would increase demand for Amazon products.
- The App Store issue is a problem; Amazon might have to slow down or rethink their app store services.
- The IPO by another tech company might be good but could also cause market uncertainty.

Overall, the tweets are somewhat positive about Amazon's performance and potential future. However, the negative tweet (the one about the app store letters) seems critical. I'll count each factor as positive except for that one which is negative.

In terms of sentiment overall, there are mixed signals: strong positive points from Barnes & Noble, tech companies, but a big concern with the App Store issue. So it's not entirely neutral or positive."
2015-03-06,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet one by one and see what they're saying.

First tweet: ""$ amzn facepalm epicfail URL."" Hmm, that sounds like someone is criticizing Amazon and making fun about their new URL. That could be a negative thing, but it's vague—maybe they don't know much about the company or its future.

Second tweet: ""$ amzn eps trend cml URL."" This one mentions Epsilon EPS, which I'm assuming refers to Amazon's earnings per share. A positive tweet would indicate good news, so this could be a sign of confidence in their financials.

Third tweet: ""$ amzn - it's all about execution - cramer's mad money ( 3/5 / 15 ) URL."" This one is talking about execution risk and Cramer's money ratio. Execution risk can affect stock prices because investors are concerned about executing trades at the right price. If they're worried, that could be negative.

Fourth tweet: ""great 15 minutes on the future of $ amzn , $ goog , $ fb , $ appl : URL."" This is very positive, saying a lot of things in just five words. It seems like it's providing a forward-looking statement, which usually indicates good news and optimism about the company's future.

Fifth tweet: ""chartguy 89 : amzn +1.34 % stock charts $ amzn URL inc . URL."" This is another positive tweet with numbers. It says their stock has increased by 1.34%, so that's a concrete sign of improvement, which is good for investors.

Sixth tweet: ""abriendo 1000 largos de $ amzn a 381.48 usd idop 177312 vía URL."" This one seems to offer information about their stock price and the currency exchange rate in advance. Sometimes companies release earnings or other updates ahead of time, but here it's just giving a quote from someone else.

Seventh tweet: ""$ edv stock price updated friday , march 6 , 2015 09:07 : 14 am $ dia $ fitx $ nugt $ amzn URL."" This is a short, technical post with specific dates. It's possible that they're announcing something significant at the time.

Eighth tweet: ""$ edv stock price updated friday , march 6 , 2015 09:07 : 14 am $ dia $ fitx $ nugt $ amzn URL."" Same as the seventh one but maybe slightly different wording. It's a quick update about their stock price.

Now, I need to analyze each tweet in terms of positive, negative, or neutral impact. Positive tweets tend to give good news that can boost the stock. Negative might be worse information or bad news. Neutral is if it's just general news without significant positive or negative implications.

Looking at them:

1. The first one seems a bit too vague but critical, maybe negative.
2. Positive about earnings, so positive.
3. Concerning execution risk and money ratio—could be negative because investors are worried about how the stock will execute.
4. Forward-looking statement is usually good for sentiment; definitely positive.
5. Stock increase by 1.34% which is significant and positive news.
6. Information from someone else, but it's just a quote without any bad info, so neutral maybe?
7-8: Short updates at a specific date—could be speculative, not sure about the impact yet.

So overall sentiment seems mostly positive with some negative factors like execution risk and technical info. But the forward-looking statement and stock increase are strong indicators."

2015-03-09,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and figure out their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by reading through each tweet carefully.

First tweet: "" axiom initiates buy on URL inc ; sees 15 % upside for the stock $ amzn url"". That seems like a positive sign because it mentions buying and an expected 15% increase. So, that’s definitely positive.

Second tweet: "" how long before $ amzn fire tv drops to $ 59 ?"". Hmm, I'm not sure about this one. It sounds like it's asking for a timeframe when Amazon's Fire TV stock price hits $59. The word ""drops"" might mean that the user is predicting something, but without specific info on why or what's expected, it's hard to tell. Maybe just a question rather than an opinion.

Third tweet: ""$ amzn stock quote , 12:46 pm : 376.82 -3.27 ( -0.86 % ) ."". This seems like a regular financial update. The price drops slightly, but there's no positive or negative comment here. It’s just an official market update.

So putting it all together: the first tweet is definitely positive about Amazon. The second isn't clear and might be a question. The third is neutral as it's just updating with price changes. So overall, there are two positive tweets and one neutrally related one, so I'd say it's positive."
2015-03-10,Positive,"Okay, let's analyze these tweets to figure out their impact on the stock price of AT_USER.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""AT_USER faa wants to speed up commercial drone approvals faa dronenews URL primeair $ amzn"". The stock symbol here is probably AT_USER because that's what they're promoting. 

Now, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. Let me take the first tweet as an example.

The tweet says ""faa wants to speed up drone approvals."" That sounds like a positive factor because it mentions something related to drones, which could be a positive signal for their business. Additionally, they mention ""url primeair $ amzn,"" which might indicate increased competition or partnerships with other companies. So, these are both positives.

Now, assessing sentiment: the tweet is encouraging them to speed up drone approvals, which can lower costs and improve efficiency. This would likely reduce AT_USER's expenses, leading to an increase in profits and a positive outlook for investors. 

Looking at the second tweet: ""$ gol prev close click here : URL also see : $ goog $ bita $ intc $ amzn ~"". It seems like they're updating their price target from GOOL (Google) to AMZN (Amazon). This kind of change in the price range can be seen as a buy signal because it suggests confidence in the company's stock performance, which is a positive sign. Investors might be more willing to pay a higher price for AMZN if they believe it's growing.

Putting this together: Both tweets are providing good news. The first one is about speeding up drone approvals, which can improve their business operations and reduce costs. The second tweet is a price update from Google to Amazon, showing investors' confidence in the company's potential future performance.

Therefore, considering both factors—cost savings and increased visibility—the overall sentiment seems positive. Investors are more optimistic about AT_USER, so the stock is expected to rise."
2015-03-11,Negative,"Alright, let's try to figure out how these tweets are going to affect Amazon's stock price. The first tweet is about retail bears coming out of hibernation. I know that retail bear markets can cause volatility in the stock because consumers might be selling shares at a discount or even dropping further. So that sounds like something that could hurt Amazon, which probably relies heavily on retail sales.

The second tweet mentions financials updating, but it's just pasted here as ""Wednesday, March 11, 2015."" I don't have the specifics of what financials were updated, but if they're positive, that might boost Amazon. However, the wording says "" retail bears coming out of hibernation"" which is pretty negative for Amazon's revenue or earnings.

The third tweet talks about revenue and EPS trends but it's just a URL without details. I'm not sure what information is there, so it's hard to assess. If it's trending upwards in terms of profits per share, that could be positive, but if it's downward, maybe negative.

Putting it all together: There are both positive and negative signals here. Some tweets indicate potential for negative impacts due to retail issues or financials, while others suggest upward trends. Without more context on how these factors interact, the sentiment is a bit unclear. I might have to consider that some effects could outweigh others, making the overall impact uncertain."
2015-03-12,Positive,"Alright, I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for Amazon. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

Starting with the first tweet: ""free video w / setups march 12 ' was that it '' $ fb $ amzn $ lnkd $ spy URL"". This seems like a promotional link, possibly related to some new product or event from the spy network. Promotional links are often seen as signals for potential positive news because they might lead to more engagement or action on the company's part.

Moving to the second tweet: ""$ thcz gained 118.43 % for our penny stock newsletter subscribers ! big news : URL $ orcl $ yhoo $ amzn"". Here, ""gained"" indicates a significant increase in value. The mention of a penny stock and newsletter subscribers suggests that this is a positive signal because they're likely paying attention to the stock performance. The specific keywords like ""orcl,"" ""yhoo,"" and ""am zn"" are technical terms related to Amazon's services, which could be important for investors.

The third tweet: ""leading thai tv station broadcasts original feature on the moto-meter URL $ fare $ uber $ amzn motorcycle taxi"". This is another promotional link. The use of ""motorcycle taxi"" might indicate a new product or partnership that Amazon is expanding, especially considering the tech sector which is booming. Promotional content can boost investor interest and expectations.

The fourth tweet: ""whalespeak - bookseller just now mentioned > $ amzn $ bamm & others of course : chart : URL"". This one has a lot of emojis like whalespeak and bookseller, which are usually associated with buzzwords or trends that don't directly relate to the stock. It also mentions a chart and URL, but it's unclear what specific information is being conveyed. The mention of ""bamm"" might suggest something unexpected or speculative, but without more context, it's hard to say if this is positive, negative, or neutral.

Now, evaluating each tweet individually: the first has a promotional link, which I think is positive. The second clearly shows significant growth, so that's definitely positive. The third adds another promotion, reinforcing the sentiment. The fourth tweet has emojis but doesn't specify content related to Amazon, making it ambiguous. 

Considering all these factors together, while some tweets are clear and direct (1, 2, 3), the fourth is less certain but might not contribute much in terms of positive or negative sentiment for the stock price. However, the overall trend seems to lean towards positive because there's a mix of promotional content and a notable increase in one of Amazon's newsletter subscribers.

Therefore, I would conclude that the overall sentiment is [Positive]."
2015-03-13,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for a given company. Let me start by understanding what each tweet is saying.

Looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER hulu , amazon and yahoo are all bidding on seinfeld . netflix took a pass . URL $ amzn $ yhoo $ nflx"". So, they're talking about people biding their time with Amazon (AMZN), Yahoo (YHOO) stock, which could mean they're looking to buy them. Netflix is taking a pass, so maybe they don't want it to jump up immediately? It seems like the user is expressing interest in buying the stocks but not rushing their prices too high.

The second tweet: ""$ fb acquires thefind , getting ready to take on $ amzn / $ ebay apparently . thefind is a cool shopping search engine URL"". Here, Facebook is acquiring something called the ""cool shopping search engine,"" which seems like a tech company. They're preparing to take on Amazon and YooL, which indicates that they might be investing in similar stocks or products. This could mean that there's some strategic alignment between them, but it's not clear how this affects stock prices yet.

Now, I need to determine the overall sentiment. The first tweet mentions people biding their time, which is a cautious approach—maybe indicating that the company isn't jumping up immediately. The second tweet suggests they might be investing in similar companies or products, which could mean alignment but not necessarily causing immediate price movements.

I'm leaning towards a positive note because while it's cautious and strategic, it doesn't seem to cause significant volatility. But maybe there's some optimism from the initial uncertainty about Netflix. However, since all tweets are cautiously phrased without overtly negative language, I might lean more towards neutral or positive overall.

Wait, but the second tweet does suggest a strategic move by Facebook, which sometimes can create buzz and attract investors. So perhaps that could signal growth in their stock price as they prepare to take on competitors. But the first tweet is about biding time, which isn't necessarily growth.

I think I'm going with positive because while it's cautious, it's not aggressive. The overall effect might be a slight upward movement but not a massive one."
2015-03-14,Neutral,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets regarding their impact on a company's stock price.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at tweet 1, there are mentions of Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), and a reference to Seinfeld, which is a TV show but not directly related to the stock. In tweet 2, similar stocks like Amazon and Google (GOOG) are mentioned.

Next, I'll analyze each tweet separately. For tweet 1, it mentions that AMZN, NFLX, and Seinfeld's influence on other stocks. Since there's no direct mention of a specific company symbol here, I might be missing something. Maybe the user is referring to a particular stock? Or perhaps it's about general sentiment towards tech companies. However, without knowing the exact stock name, it's tricky.

For tweet 2, it lists various stock symbols: Shy, FB, Luv, ADX, etc., but again, no direct target symbol given in the tweets. This could mean that the user is providing information about a range of stocks or making general comments on the stock market.

Since both tweets are focused on multiple stocks and discussing investor sentiment towards tech companies, it's hard to pinpoint an exact company for analysis. If these tweets are meant to influence a specific stock price prediction, I might need more context or the target stock name provided elsewhere in the discussion.

Given this ambiguity, I can't accurately assess the impact of these tweets on any particular stock because the symbols aren't clearly tied to a specific company. Without knowing which stock is being referred to by both tweets, it's impossible to determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative about that stock.

Wait, maybe the user intended for tweet 1 to refer to Seinfeld (a show) indirectly affecting tech stocks? But I'm not sure how that would directly influence a stock. It could imply general sentiment towards entertainment companies or something else, but it's vague.

Similarly, tweet 2 seems to be listing a broad range of sectors and companies without specifying the target company. It might be serving as a generic market commentary rather than specific to any one stock.

In conclusion, since the target stock symbols aren't clearly identified in either tweet, I can only speculate about their sentiment based on common trends or the discussions surrounding tech stocks. However, without more information, it's best to conclude that there isn't enough context provided for a precise assessment of the impact on a specific stock."
2015-03-15,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol from the tweets is ""amzn"". That seems correct because both ""Statistical Approaches to Trading"" and ""Zeptolab's king of thieves released to Google Play"" mention Amazon. So I'll focus on Amazon's tweets.

Looking at the first tweet: ""amazon : zeptolab's king of thieves released to google play | 4 - traders $ amzn amazon URL URL"". Hmm, this seems like a link to a YouTube video where Zeptolab is mentioned. The mention might be indicating something about their content or maybe related to a specific product. I'm not sure what the numbers mean here—maybe some sort of score or rankings? But without context on how these tweets influence traders' actions, it's hard to tell if this would positively affect Amazon.

The second tweet is "" statistical approaches to trading URL $ amzn $ fb $ twtr"". This mentions several stocks: Amazon, Facebook, and Twilio. The presence of these terms might suggest that the stock is being discussed or bought by investors. But again, without knowing how each tweet impacts the market, it's tricky.

I don't see any immediate positive indicators here. They're more about discussing stocks or related topics rather than confirming a good news story. So I think each tweet has a neutral impact because they're just informational and might not significantly affect the stock price."
2015-03-16,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative regarding the stock price of a company. Let me break down what each tweet says and analyze them step by step.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER business unites to break same-sex marriage bans URL corpgov $ aapl $ goog $ fb $ ko $ amzn $ xrx"". It seems like they're promoting some changes in a company's URL, possibly indicating that they've taken certain actions. The company symbols mentioned are AP, GOOG, FB, KO, AMZN, and XRX. I know that AP is Apple, FB is Facebook, AMZN is Amazon, and XRX might be a stock exchange ticker. So the context here seems to be discussing corporate action or changes in their business practices related to same-sex marriage bans. But I'm not sure if that's positive or negative for investors.

Now, moving on to the second tweet: ""weekend review video ( 3/15 ): $ spy $ iwm $ qqq $ tlt $ aapl $ amzn $ baba $ ebay $ fb $ twtr $ gild $ googl $ pcln $ panw $ tsla URL"". This one looks more like a news story or an event report. It mentions several stocks and stock symbols, which could indicate that they're providing a positive outlook on these companies' performance. The words ""review video"" and the list of company names suggest that they might be discussing upcoming earnings reports or market updates.

Comparing both tweets, the first one is more about promoting corporate changes, possibly affecting their business strategy but not necessarily positive for current stock prices. The second tweet is about providing a report or analysis on upcoming companies' performance, which could be seen as a positive indicator because it might lead to increased buyer interest or stronger demand.

However, considering the context of each company: AP, FB, AMZN, and XRX are all positive sectors like technology, e-commerce, and financial services. If they're promoting these changes without providing any specific information about their performance, that could be neutral. But if the report is optimistic and suggests growth or future plans, it might boost investor confidence.

I'm a bit torn because one tweet seems more proactive in suggesting action while the other offers an analysis. If both are positive, maybe overall sentiment leans towards positive, but without knowing how much each tweet influences investors directly, I have to make a balanced guess. Given that the second tweet is about providing an outlook on future companies and not just promoting current actions, it might be a positive signal for the stock price."
2015-03-17,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on a company's stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet, it mentions $ stocks trending now and lists several companies like $ spxl, $ jnug, etc. But wait, none of those seem familiar as a company I know. Maybe that's just information from other sources? Hmm.

The second tweet talks about $ xly open click here and URLs for amzn and bioc. Again, no obvious company name there. The third tweet mentions $ ppch gained 1005% within 3 days and lists amZN, QCOM, and CSCO. I recognize these as Amazon (AMZN) and quarterbacks at CSCO, but that might be a distraction.

The fourth tweet is about ""will this new streaming service from apple 'seriously disrupt the cable industry'?"" and mentions $ aapl and $ nflx. Aapl is Apple Inc., known for making Apple Watch and potentially services like YouTube or Google Play. So maybe the focus is on these two stocks: AAPL and NFLX.

Now, analyzing each tweet's factors. The first tweet talks about stock trends but doesn't specify the company. The second mentions xly, which I'm not sure of. Third tweet seems to mention amzn and maybe another company. Fourth mentions aapl and nflx, which are tech companies.

Next step is assessing sentiment for each relevant tweet. For the third tweet, amzn's stock has been quite volatile lately, so gains 1005% in 3 days could be significant, but the context isn't clear. The fourth tweet mentions Apple, a big company, and the streaming service from Apple. It suggests that this new service will disrupt the cable industry, which is a broader market affecting multiple companies.

Considering all tweets together: while amzn has some positive news, other factors like the disruption in the cable industry could be a catalyst for negative sentiment if people are worried about competition. Also, with increased investor interest in tech and potential stock price movements without specific confirmation might lead to mixed feelings.

Putting it all together, the positive tweet from amzn is followed by a possible negative factor from the tech disruption. It's unclear which effect dominates. Maybe it's a neutral situation."
2015-03-18,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by breaking down each tweet.

First, looking at ""amzn - amazon : feu vert à une deuxième saison de ' bosch ' . URL"", the phrase mentions a second season of ""bosch,"" which is German for ""boy."" It seems like Amazon is planning a comeback or revival, which could be positive. The mention of a URL suggests it's a new project or initiative.

Next tweet: ""$ gild $ amzn $ baba $ usdcad $ twtr URL."" This one has multiple symbols, likely referring to different assets or products. If these are financial instruments or related to the company, their movements could influence stock prices. But I'm not sure if they're directly linked to Amazon.

Third tweet: ""rt AT_USER how start-up jet wants to remake the delivery of e-commerce $ amzn URL URL."" This seems more promotional. The user is encouraging a start-up focused on e-commerce delivery. If this tweet positively influences investor confidence or expectations about Amazon, it could be positive sentiment.

Last tweet: ""$ amzn debt level trend URL"" talks about the debt levels of Amazon. A rising debt could be a concern for investors since it affects the company's financial health and potential stock performance. However, some investors might view it as an opportunity if they see it as a strategy to improve credit ratings or reduce costs.

Now, compiling these thoughts: The first tweet is positive with a comeback expectation. The third tweet adds promotional energy but may not be strong enough to offset the initial positive outlook. The second and fourth tweets are less clear, involving multiple symbols that I'm not familiar with, so it's hard to assess their impact. Considering all factors, the overall sentiment seems positive because of the first tweet and some potential promotion from the third, even if others aren't clear."
2015-03-19,Negative,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets about a stock and determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative towards it. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I think I should identify the target stock symbol in the tweets. Looking at the list, I see 'amzn' appears multiple times. So that's our target stock here: Amazon.

Now, for each tweet, I need to break them down into factors—positive and negative—and assess the sentiment on investor sentiment. But wait, since all the tweets mention ""amazon,"" maybe it's a bit tricky because they're all related to Amazon's performance or related companies like Amara, Gildan, etc.

Let me go through each tweet:

1. The first tweet has several stocks listed without any target. It says 'AMAZON' and mentions something about awarding certificates for experiments with drones. That might be a positive factor because it shows they're innovating.

2. The second tweet is an email saying ""AT_USER amazon awarded certificate..."" which seems to express support or encouragement, but not sure if it's positive or negative. I'll need to look further.

3. Third tweet: They mention 'orcl' and 'yhoo,' both of which are AWS companies. This could be about their business performance.

4. Fourth tweet is an email comparing profits from AMZN with ExxonMobil. It seems to suggest Amazon isn't as profitable, but that's a bit controversial because Amzo is a major player in e-commerce and cloud services.

5. Fifth tweet talks about penny stocks gaining 500% over two months and offers alerts. This could be positive if it's showing growth, but the mention of AWS might imply some underlying issues.

6. The sixth tweet is about ""bbry"" which I think was a typo for ""sentiment."" It mentions various indices including S&P 500 (SPX), NVIDIA (NFLX), and DJIA. This seems like a neutral trend, but the mention of 'sentiment' might indicate some emotions.

7. The seventh tweet is another typo for ""bbry"" again. It says Amazon gets FA A clearance to test drones outdoors. That sounds positive about their technology projects.

8. Eighth tweet links Amzn with eBay shutting down ecommerce services andebasinc. This seems like a negative sentiment because eBay is a big player in e-commerce and their shutdown could hurt Amzo.

9. Ninth tweet talks about AMZN's earnings per employee trends. If they're increasing, that would be positive but the mention of employees might not fully convey it yet.

10. Tenth tweet mentions FA A announcing awarding customers with drones for experiments. Positive because it's showing success in their innovation.

11. Eleventh tweet is repeating the tenth one, so same sentiment.

12. Twelfth tweet repeats the same as tenth, no new info.

13. Thirteenth same as before.

14. Fourteenth says Amazon profits are still less than ExxonMobil's take home. That seems like a negative statement about their profitability.

15. Fifteenth is about Target letting winners run with tgt stock. Maybe indicating that winners are doing well, but not sure if it's positive or negative.

16. Twelfth tweet again about Barnes & Noble being more profitable than surface appearance—maybe implying they're doing better financially than people think.

Now, compiling the sentiment from all tweets:

Positive factors: AWS innovation ( tweets 3-6), Amazon getting clearance for drones (tweets 5-7), potential earnings growth (tweets 9-14), Target's performance (tweet 15). Negative factors: Comparison with ExxonMobil profits (t14), eBay issues (t8), profitability of Barnes & Noble (t12).

Looking at the overall picture, there are both positive and negative sentiments. Some tweets suggest growth potential or positive trends, while others hint at underlying challenges or financial comparisons.

Since the sentiment isn't overwhelmingly positive or neutral but has mixed perspectives, I think the overall impact is probably [Neutral] because it's a mix of varied opinions."
2015-03-20,Positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out how these tweets are affecting Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

The first tweet says Amazon gets FAA clearance for testing drones outdoors and it's $10 amazons. I know FAAs allow companies to conduct certain types of tests, so this seems positive. It might boost Amazon's reputation and potentially increase demand for their drone products, which can go up stock price.

Next, the second tweet is a bit short but still mentions FAA clearance for testing primeair drones. That reinforces the positive trend from the first one. More approvals mean less competition or higher demand, so Amazon should benefit.

The third tweet mentions Alzheimer's and drone approvals pushing both companies higher. Alzaiine is a healthcare company, and if they're getting approvals, it can attract investors. But I'm not sure if that's good for Amazon directly or not.

The fourth tweet says Alibaba and Microsoft are friends, but it doesn't mention anything about Amazon. So probably no immediate impact on Amazon from this one.

Fifth tweet talks about FAA giving clearance for testing drones outdoors. That sounds like a specific type of test which could be more favorable, maybe attracting more clients or buyers. Positive sign overall.

Sixth tweet repeats the same thing as the first one. Another FAA clearance and more dollars invested in their drone tests. This adds to the positive outlook from previous tweets.

The seventh tweet has multiple stock prices: amzn, cmg, slb, sndk. Those are all ETFs related to aerospace companies. They might be part of Amazon's portfolio or influencing the market indirectly through diversification.

Eighth tweet mentions drones developers wanting to soar over delivery hurdles. That sounds like a strategic move, possibly improving their product's performance and thus stock price.

Putting it all together, most tweets seem positive about Amazon's drone testing approvals and investments. Some mention other companies or ETFs, but the main focus is on Amazon. So overall sentiment should be positive."
2015-03-21,Positive,"Alright, let's see what I've got here. So, the user provided four tweets and asked me to determine their impact on Amazon's stock price using either [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Hmm, okay.

First, I need to figure out the target stock from the tweets. The tweets mention AMZN and some other stocks like DOW and MICK. Wait, but only one of them seems relevant for AMZN. Let me check each tweet.

Looking at tweet 1: It mentions $ amzn r & d and operating margin trends URL URL. Not sure about that. Maybe it's just an update from a website or a report? Doesn't seem like the stock symbol is clearly extracted here, so perhaps this tweet doesn't provide enough information for AMZN.

Tweet 2 talks about Dow, Mickey, Amazon drone program cleared for liftoff, and OTC. The mention of ""drone program cleared for liftoff"" is interesting. That sounds positive because it's encouraging the company to go public. So that seems like a strong positive factor.

Tweet 3 discusses short sales updated on Saturday, March 21, 2015, but the exact dates and details are unclear. Maybe it's just an update from someone else. The mention of specific cryptocurrencies like $ thcz $ gdx $ xlv $ qld might not relate to AMZN directly, so perhaps this tweet doesn't add much in terms of AMZN sentiment.

Tweet 4 is about RT TheStreet mentioning that Amazon moves closer to drone delivery and $ amzn. That sounds positive too because it's providing information on a product (drone) the company is advancing towards. It might lead investors to expect growth, which could be positive for Amazon's stock.

So, putting this together: the second tweet is clearly positive with the drone program cleared, the fourth tweet is also positive about moving closer to a product. The third tweet doesn't add much relevant information. Therefore, both tweets contribute positively to the outlook on Amazon."
2015-03-22,Positive,"Okay, so I have to figure out whether each tweet is positive, negative, or neutral in relation to Amazon's stock price and then determine the overall impact on the company. Let me take it step by step.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""$ llbo gained over 1400 % in the past 5 weeks ! huge news : URL $ amzn $ qcom $ csco"". Hmm, ""llbo"" looks like an acronym for something, maybe stock ticker. It says the symbol ""llbo"" gained a lot (over 1400%) in the last five weeks and is related to AMZN, QCOM, and CSCO. That sounds positive because it's talking about a significant increase and relates to several companies, which could be a good sign for Amazon's stock. So I'll mark this as Positive.

Next tweet: ""$ amzn , $ pcln , $ jd , $ nflx , $ vips r & d trend comparison URL URL"". The text mentions AMZN, PCLN (which I think stands for PCLX, the stock ticker for Amazon), JD, NFLX, and VIPS R&D. It also has a URL pointing to a trend comparison page. Positive again because it's talking about significant items like AMZN and others, which could indicate positive news for Amazon. So this one is also Positive.

I think both tweets are reinforcing the idea that AMZN is doing well, so their combined impact should be Positive overall."
2015-03-23,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price and determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, the target stock is Amazon, symbol AMZN. 

Looking at the tweets:

1. "" $ amzn < study the charts > the k . i . s . s . version : URL"" – Hmm, this seems like a link to some kind of content or maybe an update about their website or social media. It's unclear without more context, but I think it might be related to their stock updates.

2. ""$ amzn stock quote , 1:45 pm : 377.505 -0.985 ( -0.260 % ) . "" – This looks like a tweet showing the current price of AMZN and its percentage change from the previous day. The quote itself is just the current price, but without sentiment indicators, I can't really tell if it's positive or negative yet.

3. ""$ amzn now closed up / down past 9 days . "" – This seems to be mentioning that over the past nine days, AMZN has either increased or decreased in price. The word ""closed"" might imply a change, but without knowing whether it's up or down and by how much, I can't assess sentiment.

4. ""$ amzn - read this before you quit on cable URL"" – This tweet is offering to discuss the stock, specifically mentioning ""quit on cable,"" which could be a way to prompt discussion about AMZN. The mention of quitting might indicate that they're encouraging others to read more about the company, but I don't have enough information to gauge impact.

Putting it all together, none of these tweets provide a clear indication of positive or negative sentiment regarding Amazon's stock. They seem to be providing price data and potentially offering further discussion. So my best guess is that there's no significant impact on the stock price based on these tweets."
2015-03-24,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine if they'll impact the stock price of Amazon. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, the target stock is AMZN, right? So I should focus on each tweet related to AMZN or services like Twitch that might affect its stock.

1. The first tweet says AT_USER has some success with $5 on Amazon's spreads if you ask about strikes. That sounds technical and could be relevant for price changes, but it seems a bit vague without more context.

2. The second tweet mentions being excited about Baltimore & Miami and introduces Prime delivery service with 1-hour delivery times. This is about service improvements, which might not directly affect Amazon's stock price unless there are rumors or updates about their competitors.

3. The third tweet points out that AMZN could be hacked on Twitch. That's serious news for security reasons but doesn't relate to stock performance. It's more of a privacy concern rather than a business update.

4. The fourth tweet talks about 20% of video streamers using someone else's password, which might not connect to AMZN directly. It seems out of context unless there are specific incidents involving Amazon employees, but it doesn't seem related.

5. The fifth tweet mentions relative volume on NASDAQ and SPY. NASDAQ is the broader market index, and SPY is the S&P 500 ETF. High volume can indicate good news for any stock, but without more context about how this affects AMZN, I can't be sure.

6. The sixth tweet suggests that Amazon's Twitch has unauthorized access issues. Similar to the third tweet, it's unrelated unless there are rumors or updates affecting security, which doesn't impact AMZN's stock price positively or negatively.

7. The seventh tweet is about a Morning Call by sogotrade on spotlight stocks. This could be more about market analysis or partnerships rather than Amazon itself.

8. The eighth tweet mentions the sum of parts and a potential valuation range between $350 and $660 for AMZN. That sounds like it's giving an analyst opinion, which can affect investor sentiment. If there are positive outlooks on AMZN, that could be a positive signal.

9. The ninth tweet is about CTSH filings updating for QCOM and other companies around March 24th. This relates to the company's financials or operations but doesn't directly impact Amazon unless there are news related to Amazon itself or a partnership.

Putting it all together, the main positive tweet (number 8) is likely to be more influential because it's giving a range of potential valuations and opinions from someone with experience. However, since it's an analyst opinion without specific details on how AMZN might be affected, I can't definitively say it's positive for Amazon. It might have some sentiment, but the other tweets seem less relevant or more about unrelated topics.

So, considering all these factors, the overall sentiment is a mix of some positive and negative influences, but leaning more towards positive because the analyst opinion could provide insights into AMZN's future performance."
2015-03-25,Negative,"Alright, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on Amazon's stock price and conclude whether it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from all the tweets. Looking at them, there are a few mentions: ""amzn"", ""nflx"", and ""twtr"". The most common is Amazon, so I'll focus on those.

Now, for each relevant tweet, I need to separate positive (P) and negative (N) factors and assess their sentiment towards investor sentiment. Let's look at each one:

1. ""netflix , inc . viewing to be measured by nielsen $ nflx $ amzn URL nielsen amazon netflix"" – This seems like an unrelated tweet about netflix, so probably not affecting Amazon.
2. ""$ amzn 377.5 / 375 put credit spread with 2 dte . offering $ 1.25"" – This is a financial announcement about Amazon's stock price movement and a credit spread trade. It might impact investor confidence but seems neutral because it's a specific announcement without extreme sentiment.
3. ""$ amzn amazon drops plan to build data centre in south korea - - maeil"" – This mentions Amazon dropping plans to build a data center in South Korea. That's significant because South KOREA is an important market, and such news can affect stock prices, especially with global economic factors. It might be negative.
4. ""ahh burned on $ yelp today . $ amzn still holding from yesterday's call . easy short day on $ fb $ twtr $ spy $ iwm . bounce tomorrow is very likely ."" – This tweet is emotional and uses words like ""burned"" and ""easy short,"" which suggests disappointment or frustration. It affects investor sentiment negatively.
5. ""$ amzn URL updated at rbc capital on strong growth potential in india - URL $ amzn URL"" – This mentions a positive growth potential in India, which can boost the stock price. It's generally seen as positive by many investors.
6. ""$ amazon blasts u . s . faa for slowness on drone regulation URL via AT_USER drones amazon $ amzn"" – This tweet talks about drone regulations and user concerns. It suggests that if regulations are slow, Amazon might face challenges, which could negatively impact their stock price.

Now, compiling the sentiments:

- Tweet 2 is neutral.
- Tweet 3 is negative because building a data center in South Korea is a major project with potential economic impacts.
- Tweet 4 is negative due to emotional tone and disappointment.
- Tweets 5 and 6 are positive for Amazon's growth outlook on India and drone regulations respectively.

Putting it all together, while some tweets like 3 and 5 and 6 have significant positive elements, the tweet on Twitter (tweet 4) shows clear frustration. However, the overall sentiment seems mixed because there are both negative and positive factors. Given that many of them show uncertainty or positive expectations, the stock might not trend upwards much but could still be considered slightly positive."
2015-03-26,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about Amazon's stock performance. The user wants an overall impact on their future stock price, so I need to look at each tweet and see if they're positive or negative.

Starting with the first tweet: ""Our penny stock picks have gained over 1485 % in the past 4 months ! massive update : URL $ amzn $ mcox $ goog"". That's a big deal. They mentioned that their picks are up more than four times, which is an indication of good news for investors. It looks positive because it's showing growth and potential.

The second tweet: ""rt $ amzn - amazon brings prime now to dallas , offering one-hour delivery of daily essentials URL"". This seems like a direct business update about their supply chain or delivery services. The user is offering something in return, which can be seen as a positive signal for future performance. People are looking ahead, so that's good.

Third tweet: ""$ amzn : angie's list ( angi ) , others on watch as amazon ( amzn ) set to roll ... : URL"". This mentions Amazon rolling out services via Angie's List and other platforms. Rolling out new products or services is a positive sign because it can increase customer satisfaction and sales, which is good for investors.

Fourth tweet: ""$ amzn amazon one-hour delivery expands to dallas URL"". They're expanding their one-hour delivery time across Dallas. That sounds like a competitive advantage since they can deliver faster, reducing costs and improving efficiency. More aggressive market expansion can be a positive sign in the short term.

Fifth tweet: ""$ amzn - microsoft vs google : did samsung just tip the tablet battle ? URL"". Here, it's comparing Amazon's performance to Microsoft and Google in tablets. If it says that Samsung has done well in the tablet space, that could be a positive note because it indicates ongoing success and competition from other big names. It might signal that Amazon is still doing well in their core areas.

Sixth tweet: same as the second one with ""prime now to dallas ... one-hour delivery URL"". Similar to the second tweet, this again suggests a direct business update about their supply chain services. People are often eager for more growth and improvements, so this would be positive.

Seventh tweet: ""$ amzn amazon expanding prime now one-hour delivery to dallas covering 4 metros via AT_USER $ amzn URL"". This is an expanded version of the previous one. They're going even further, which could mean increased efficiency or market reach. More aggressive delivery options can boost confidence in the company's ability to deliver and satisfy customers.

Now, putting it all together. Each tweet seems to be providing direct information about Amazon's supply chain improvements, new services, expansion, and competitive performance against others like Microsoft and Google. These are all positive signs that could indicate strong demand for Amazon products, potentially increasing investor confidence in their future performance. The mention of a penny stock picking gaining a lot and expanding delivery options suggests they're looking ahead to the future, which is good.

So overall, the tweets are showing growth opportunities and improved service offerings, all pointing towards a positive sentiment for Amazon's stock."
2015-03-27,Positive,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of Amazon (AMZN). First, I need to identify each tweet and extract the target stock symbol. Looking at the tweets provided:

1. ""great free tutorial here for traders URL $ nflx $ bac $ amzn $ amzn"" – Hmm, this one includes both NFLX and BAC but AMZN is clearly mentioned multiple times.
2. ""$ amzn april 15 300 put $ lnkd april 15 200 put investing intelligentinvestor stocks options futures bigdata URL"" – This tweet mentions AMZN but also includes LNK, BIGDAWY, and an option strategy. It seems like the user is offering a strategy on AMZN.
3. ""$ amzn - jury backs kleiner perkins in sex-bias case URL"" – Again, AMZN appears here as the main topic. The jury backing the company in this case might influence investor sentiment positively.
4. ""rt AT_USER sold $ amzn $ 370 puts for $ 0.75 ( + 25 % ) ."" – This tweet is a direct selling call on AMZN's put options with a significant profit, which would likely increase demand and drive the stock up.
5. ""$ amzn , $ pcln , $ ebay , $ jd , $ nflx revenue trend comparison chart : URL"" – This one mentions AMZN along with PCLN (which I'm not familiar with), EBAY, JD.com, and NFLX. It seems like there's a discussion about financial trends or comparisons between companies.
6. ""$ wwd : amazon in talks to acquire net-a-porter URL $ amzn $ cfruy $ cfrhf"" – This tweet mentions AMZN and is part of a deal proposal with NET-A PORTER, which could be good news for Amazon if the acquisition goes through.

Now, considering each tweet's factors. The first four tweets are all about AMZN, with some offering strategies or selling puts. The last two also include AMZN but focus more on other companies and deals.

For sentiment analysis:
1. The initial three tweets mention AMZN multiple times, which is a strong indicator of it being the target stock.
2. The fourth tweet is a direct sell offer for put options at a profit, which suggests positive sentiment towards AMZN's valuation.
3. The fifth tweet includes revenue trends and a comparison chart, which are generally considered neutral to speculative in nature.
4. The sixth tweet is part of a deal proposal with another company, which could be positive if the acquisition is beneficial.

Overall, most tweets are related to AMZN or discussing other companies but mostly focus on positive activities like selling put options or engaging in deals. The sentiment towards AMZN seems overall positive due to the direct strategies and the potential for good deals."
2015-03-28,Positive,"Alright, let me break down how I would approach analyzing these tweets to determine their impact on Amazon's stock price.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the tweets:

1. The first one mentions Amazon with a price of $370.56.
2. The second tweet talks about Penny stocks gaining 1600% over four months and offers subscriptions via several platforms: $ orcl, $ yhoo, $ amzn.
3. The third tweet predicts that by 2020, 50% of American households will be Amazon Prime members.
4. The fourth tweet discusses Amazon targeting Kirana stores for online sales.

So the main stock here is Amazon with symbol ""amzn.""

Next, I'll analyze each tweet to identify positive or negative factors and assess sentiment towards investor opinion.

1. First tweet: It mentions a price increase but doesn't provide much detail on the impact yet. The term ""max pain"" might indicate some concern about market performance, which could be negative.
2. Second tweet: It's promoting subscriptions for Penny stocks, which is positive because it can boost sales and attract more subscribers. This could lead to increased revenue and potentially stock gains.
3. Third tweet: A prediction that half of American households will become Amazon Prime by 2020. This is a forward-looking statement with a positive outlook on future growth, which can be seen as a favorable signal for the stock price.
4. Fourth tweet: Discussing online sales via Kirana stores suggests potential revenue growth through e-commerce channels, which could impact stock performance.

Now, I need to assess each tweet's sentiment individually:

1. The first tweet talks about market pain, but without more details on the extent or immediate effects, it's a bit vague.
2. The second tweet is focused on promoting services that can directly benefit Amazon through subscriber numbers and revenue.
3. The third tweet is speculative with a forward-looking statement, which might encourage buy-sides growth and higher valuations.
4. The fourth tweet discusses e-commerce sales via Kirana, which could be an indicator of broader consumer confidence affecting Amazon's stock.

Combining these factors:

- The promotion of services (second tweet) suggests positive trends in subscriber numbers and potential revenue.
- The forward-looking statement (third tweet) indicates growth expectations that can drive investor sentiment positively.
- The online sales mention is a potential boost to the company, which could help with future stock price.

However, the first tweet's mention of market pain without concrete details might be seen as a dip in current sentiment. But since it's not a direct prediction of a decline, it's more about concerns rather than negative factors affecting the stock.

Putting it all together: The positive aspects like promotion of services and e-commerce sales contribute to investor confidence. Even though the first tweet has some uncertainty, the others show clear trends that could influence Amazon's future stock price positively."
2015-03-29,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of TSLA or LRT. I'm not an expert in stock trading, but I'll take it step by step.

First, looking at the target stock. The first tweet mentions $ tlt company info updated Sunday, March 29, 2015, and several other prices. It also lists some URLs. Hmm, TLT isn't something I recognize as a stock symbol. Maybe it's a typo? Perhaps they meant to mention another stock like LRT or perhaps TSLA. Alternatively, maybe it's an abbreviation for something else, but without more context, I'll assume it's a company name.

The second tweet is about $ amzn investor opinions updated Sunday, March 29, 2015 at 11:59 pm, with several stocks mentioned: $ tsla (which is TSLA), $ mo, $ gild, and $ tqqq. Again, similar structure as the first tweet.

So both tweets are reporting on stock price updates. The first one tells me that some of their prices have been updated, but it's not clear if they're showing positive or negative information. The second tweet is about investor sentiment: "" Investor opinions"" suggests positive info because investors' opinions can indicate expectations for future performance.

Now, putting this together. The first tweet just says ""company info updated,"" which could mean either positively or negatively, but without more context, it's hard to tell. The second tweet explicitly mentions ""investor opinions,"" which usually indicates positive trends because people might think the stock will perform well based on their thoughts and analysis.

But wait, sometimes investor sentiment can be mixed. If someone thinks a company is undervalued, that could lead to positive expectations. However, without specific details about what's in those opinions, it's hard to say for sure if they're positive or just neutral. For example, if the opinions are from analysts with optimistic views, that might lean towards positive.

But since one tweet says ""negative"" and another says ""positive,"" maybe I need to see which one is more likely contributing to the overall sentiment. If the first tweet doesn't specify the direction but just updates prices, it could be either. The second tweet's investors might have mixed signals, but focusing on ""investor opinions"" gives a hint of positive outlook.

I'm also considering that the user didn't provide the actual stock symbol for TLT or LRT, which would make it harder to analyze their performance. Perhaps they meant another company, and maybe I should infer based on context or availability. If neither is clear, but one is about opinions (positive) and the other is just price info (neutral or negative), then the overall sentiment might lean towards positive because the second tweet's investors' thoughts could push expectations positively.

So putting it all together: The first tweet gives a price update, which might be neutral. The second tweet provides investor insights, suggesting a positive outlook. Maybe these two tweets are trying to convey that TSLA is a strong stock with good fundamentals and optimistic market views, leading the overall sentiment towards positive."
2015-03-30,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets about the Amazon stock and determine its impact on the future price. I'm not very familiar with the specifics of investing, so I'll have to think this through step by step.

First, looking at each tweet one by one. The user has provided seven tweets, but they all start with a mention of ""amazon services allows you to hire a professional goat herder!"" or something about goats and business. Since goats aren't related to any stock I know much about, I'm not sure if this is relevant. It seems like each tweet is talking about the company itself, specifically Amazon's services.

Looking at the first tweet: ""amazon reportedly testing delivery drones at secret location in bc url $ amzn uavs url."" Hmm, that might mean something about their logistics or tech solutions. But I'm not sure how this affects Amazon's stock price directly. Maybe they're testing new products, but without more context, it's hard to tell if that's positive or negative.

The second tweet: ""equinix = expansion URL ibdnews vía ibdinvestors $ eqix $ amzn $ msft $ aapl $ fb $ dlr $ dft $ goog … url."" This seems like an update about Equinix. I know Equinix is a major utility company, but how does that impact Amazon? It could be related to their joint venture or investments, but without specific information on stock performance, it's hard to assess.

The third tweet: ""rt AT_USER yes , amazon services allows you to hire a professional goat herder ! goatgrazing $ amzn beta url url."" Again, goats don't seem directly related. Maybe it's just a random mention? It could be a play on words or unrelated information. Not sure about the sentiment here.

The fourth tweet: ""$ altr $ intc $ jef $ aapl $ googl $ amzn $ biib : u . s . index futures signal stocks will rise on central-bank bets : url."" This looks like it's talking about future stock market trends, specifically suggesting that the S&P 500 might go up due to central-bank actions. That could indicate a positive outlook for Amazon's stock because it suggests investor confidence in the company's future performance.

The fifth tweet: ""will apple's move into tv disrupt the cable industry ? url $ aapl $ nflx $ cmcsa $ amzn $ foxa $ dis url."" Apple is known to be involved in TV products. The mention of the cable industry disrupts by Apple moving into them could mean more competition, but it doesn't directly tie into Amazon's stock. It might imply that other companies are entering the market, but not necessarily impacting Amazon.

The sixth tweet: ""rt AT_USER yes , amazon services allows you to hire a professional goat herder ! goatgrazing $ amzn beta url url."" This looks similar to tweet three, with a random mention of goats again. I'm not sure about the sentiment here either.

The seventh tweet: ""$ t $ lbtya $ vz $ tef $ viv $ bt $ s could license or partner with $ audc new Ott siri for enterprise and consumers url $ amzn."" This seems like it's talking about potential partnerships or licenses, possibly related to cloud computing services. If Amazon is involved in such tech areas, it might affect their performance, but again, without more info on stock trends, it's speculative.

Putting this all together: The first tweet has some vague stuff with delivery drones, the third and sixth are random goat mentions, second, fourth, fifth, seventh are about other companies. The fourth tweet is looking at future market trends due to central-bank bets, which could suggest a positive outlook for Amazon. But I'm not sure how significant that impact is compared to other factors.

So overall, the strongest indicator seems to be the fourth tweet pointing towards positive stock market trends. However, since there are other tweets mentioning unrelated topics and without concrete data on Amazon's performance or related sectors, it's hard to conclude definitively. It could still carry some positive sentiment but isn't a strong enough factor."
2015-03-31,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually and then see how they all fit together.

First, there are a bunch of links with AMZN in them. That probably means people are tracking Amazon because they’re interested in their stock performance. So right away, I think that suggests it's going up because more attention is being paid to the company.

Looking at each tweet one by one:

1. The first tweet says their penny stock did well over 1400% in four months and invites subscribers. This sounds like positive news about the stock's growth potential. So, that's a clear signal for a positive trend.

2. The second tweet mentions an update on merging Amex with Yoox Group. While I'm not sure what the outcome of this merge is, the fact that it's being discussed indicates that there might be some event affecting Amazon, which could impact stock prices. However, without knowing the details, it's hard to tell if it's positive or negative for Amazon.

3. The third tweet talks about Google and Facebook fearing each other. This seems like a competitive situation between the two companies, especially since they're both in tech. If one faces the other, it could lead to some price swings. But again, without specific info on their intentions, I can't say for sure if this is positive or negative.

4. The fourth tweet from U.S. transportation SEC asks a question about home-delivery drones and mentions that Google is responding. This could be a regulatory news event affecting the stock. Regulatory issues can definitely impact companies, but whether it's good or bad isn't clear here.

5. The fifth tweet says there was a first-quarter washout for Amazon. A washout usually means that after a positive news release, things go south in the short term. So if there are big updates, especially in tech stocks, that can cause a sell-off. This looks like a red flag for negative sentiment.

6. The sixth tweet is a reaction to Jeff Bezos' wife offering a take on Amazon. While interesting, I don't know if this affects stock prices directly. It's more about the company's leadership or maybe consumer opinions on their work. Could be a neutral or even speculative factor.

7. The seventh tweet says ""really really bizarre / really out of the box thinking from Amazon."" This seems like innovation, which could lead to increased demand and potentially higher stock prices. So this is likely positive.

8. The eighth tweet lists many other stocks that AMZN might be involved in. This indicates broader market trends or news affecting the overall tech sector. If the tech industry is doing well, it could boost Amazon's performance. But if there are specific sectors affected, it can tip the balance.

Putting this all together: There are both positive signs about growth and innovation, regulatory issues, and potential price impacts from market changes like merges, partnerships, or regulatory actions. The fact that a lot of these tweets mention AMZN suggests high interest in its performance. However, the mix of positive and negative signals makes it uncertain.

I think the overall sentiment is a mix of positive factors like growth and innovation, but also some negative signs like a potential washout due to the first-quarter results. Since there's significant buzz and multiple companies are linked, the trend could be mixed but leaning towards positive."
2015-04-01,Neutral,"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company and categorize them as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

First, looking at the target stock symbol in the problem description, it seems like Amazon (AMZN). The user has provided three tweets, but they don't include a specific stock name. Hmm, maybe I should assume that each tweet is referring to different stocks? Or perhaps there's an inconsistency here. Let me check.

Looking back, the first tweet mentions $ amzn dash with a little bit of humor and URL. That could refer to Amazon. The second tweet has multiple URLs: $ p $ amzn $ nflx $ yhoo $ aapl $ thcz $ cgra $ oxi … This might be referring to other companies like Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX), YYY, Adepto, and others. The third tweet is about various stocks: $ lulu, $ pir, $ asna.

This inconsistency makes it hard to pinpoint the target stock. Maybe the user intended for each tweet to refer to a different company or perhaps a typo where all tweets are about Amazon? Alternatively, maybe they mixed up some symbols. I'm not entirely sure, so perhaps I'll proceed by analyzing each tweet's sentiment relative to what I know of Amazon's performance.

Looking at the first tweet: ""my quick take on $ amzn dash with a little bit of humor URL."" The mention of AMZN and humor could be positive. It seems like the speaker is expressing excitement or interest, which can be seen as positive. So this tweet might have a positive sentiment towards Amazon.

The second tweet has multiple URLs including NFLX (Netflix), APL (Apple), YYY (YouTube/Youtube), OXiMOO (Not provided, but could be another app), and others. While some of these companies are related to tech or entertainment, they aren't necessarily part of the tech sector. The presence of terms like ""applied"" in YYY might suggest it's a stock on a platform, perhaps unrelated to Amazon. The overall sentiment here is more about market sentiment rather than specific company performance.

The third tweet mentions stocks like Lulu (which I know is a hardware company), pir (perhaps a typo for pirated software?), and Asna (which could be a music label). Again, these are not directly related to Amazon.

Considering all this, it seems the main focus of the user's tweets isn't on a specific stock but rather general market sentiment or speculation about various sectors. Since none of the tweets specifically mention AMZN as the target stock symbol, I can't make a precise assessment based on the given information. However, some tweets are positive about AMZN, others are more speculative and could be considered neutral or negative.

I might have to conclude that overall, the sentiment is ambiguous because the tweets don't specify which stock they're referring to. It's possible that each tweet is unrelated or doesn't provide enough context for a clear assessment."
2015-04-02,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. I'm not very experienced in analyzing stock market data, but I'll do my best.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. The words ""amzn"" and ""gild"" appear frequently, so that must be Amazon, Inc., or its parent company GILD. Since the user provided the stock symbol as ""amzn,"" I'll assume it's Amazon.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one to extract any positive (P) or negative (N) factors and assess the sentiment for each.

1. The first tweet mentions high open interest for an option expiration date. That sounds like a technical analysis point where more shares are being sold, which can sometimes indicate good news if it's related to trading volume. So this seems like a positive factor.

2. The second tweet talks about StarZ moving into international markets with services from the Middle East. Moving into international markets is usually seen as a positive sign because it could open new opportunities and bring in foreign support, which can boost stock price. This is a positive factor.

3. The third tweet is similar to the second but mentions the StarZ part. Again, moving into international markets would be a positive influence on Amazon's growth potential. So another positive factor here.

4. The fourth tweet has a quote from Facebook about how tech giants stack up in the Great 1B visa debate regarding Amazon and Apple. The mention of the U.S. government's impact on tech companies can be seen as a strategic advantage, which would likely benefit Amazon's stock price. So this is another positive factor.

5. The fifth tweet updates the stock prices for Amazon, Gild, and StarZ on Wednesday, April 1, 2015. While stock price updates are generally news that affects investor sentiment, they don't provide detailed information about factors influencing the company's performance or market reception. So this is more of an update than a factor.

Now, let me summarize each tweet:

1. Positive (P)
2. Positive (P)
3. Positive (P)
4. Positive (P)
5. No specific info, so maybe neutral? Although it's a significant event, I'm not sure if it adds much to the overall sentiment beyond just updating prices.

Putting this together, all five tweets focus on factors that support Amazon's performance in international markets and strategic moves, which are positive indicators. The last tweet is an update rather than a factor, so it might not significantly affect the stock sentiment.

Therefore, considering the majority of these tweets point towards good signs and no major negative developments, the overall sentiment is positive."
2015-04-03,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on Amazon's stock price. First, I need to identify the target stock mentioned in each tweet. The first tweet says ""master the application of technical analysis URL $ amzn $ fb $ twtr."" Hmm, that looks like it might be related to AMZN (Amazon) or TWTR. But since AMZN is more common and the word ""master"" suggests a skill or technique, maybe it's about using technical analysis on Amazon. 

The second tweet mentions ""rt AT_USER why 3dprinting stocks are ripe for m & a deals URL via AT_USER $ ssys $ ddd $ xone $ vjet $ onvo $ amzn $ goog $ msf …"" Okay, this one has multiple financial terms like 3D Printing and M&A (Merge and Acquire) deals. These are relevant to tech companies, which could be a broader market, not just AMZN.

Now, for each tweet, I need to separate the factors into Positive and Negative. In the first tweet, ""master the application of technical analysis"" sounds like it's about learning or applying a skill—probably positive because investing in techniques is common. So that would be a positive factor. 

The second tweet talks about 3D printing stocks being ready for M&A deals. This involves multiple sectors and could impact tech-related stocks, but since they're mentioning M&A which is more speculative and possibly related to tech companies, the sentiment might be neutral because it's not clear how it will affect AMZN directly. But maybe it's a factor that adds value.

So putting it together: one positive factor (master technical analysis) and a neutral factor (3D printing stocks). When combining these for overall sentiment, it seems like there are mixed signals—some positive actions by investors or companies involved in M&A, but the direct impact on AMZN is unclear. It might be considered as [Neutral] because without clear information about how this will affect Amazon's performance."
2015-04-04,Positive,"Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user provided two tweets and asked me to determine their impact on the stock price using [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, I need to extract the target stock from both tweets. Looking at tweet 1: ""$ thcz is one of the best penny stocks with over 700 % gains in 2 months ! huge news : URL $ orcl $ yhoo $ amzn"". The stock symbol here is ""orcl"" ( Oracle). In tweet 2, it's ""$ thcz is one of the best penny stocks with over 700 % gains in 2 months ! huge news : URL $ qcom $ csco"". Again, the same stock, so both tweets point to ""orcl"".

Next, I'll analyze each tweet individually. Both mentions Oracle gaining significant percentages over two months. That sounds like a positive trend. The user has made the stock perform well in just two months, which is pretty quick and suggests good developments.

For each tweet, it's clear that the focus is on Oracle's performance. They're highlighting gains and mentioning other companies but not interfering with the main sentiment. 

Now, considering the factors: Positive factors are high stock price growth (over 700%), a lack of negative news affecting investors. The user didn't mention any negative developments; instead, they focused solely on Oracle.

Assessing sentiment: The positive factors alone indicate an upward trend. Even without mentioning other companies or negatives, just seeing Oracle's gains in two months is enough to lean towards a positive outlook.

Combining all this information, the overall sentiment should be positive because of the high stock price gains and the lack of negative influences on investors."
2015-04-05,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this. So, I've got two tweets here and I need to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided some context about an example response they want me to follow, so maybe that will help.

First, looking at the target stock symbol in the Solving Process step. But wait, neither of the tweets explicitly mention a stock symbol. Hmm, this might be confusing. Maybe I need to infer based on the content? Let's see.

The first tweet is helpful for stock options beginners, mentioning several companies like AAPL (Amazon), AMZN (Amazon), FB (Apple), and others with similar names. It's promoting resources related to stock options. That makes me think it might be looking at stock options in general, but not a specific company. The second tweet talks about something called ""AT_USER_MAKT,"" then mentions AT_USER, which I know stands for Amazon User, followed by ""MKT."" That likely refers to Amazon's (AMZN) product or service.

So, without a specific target stock mentioned, perhaps the analysis should focus on how these tweets affect investors in general related to options and Amazon. But wait, the Solving Process step says ""Identify the Target Stock"" before analyzing each tweet. Maybe I'm missing something here. Perhaps the first tweet is about general financial advice or tech topics, while the second is more specific.

I think the key here is that the user provided an example response which concluded with ""[Positive]"" because it was helpful for someone looking at options. But without a specific target stock symbol in either tweet, maybe I should assume they're referring to AMZN since it's mentioned in both? Or perhaps the first tweet isn't directly targeting a specific company but rather a broader topic.

I need to think about what each tweet implies. The first is promoting learning resources for options and tech, which might attract investors looking for information on stock-related products or services. The second tweet is from Amazon (AMZN), so that's probably indicating something about the market or technology related to AMZN.

But without knowing the exact target stock, I'm not entirely sure how to proceed. Maybe the user just wants a summary based on these tweets. If neither tweet mentions a specific company, perhaps it's best to focus on broader trends indicated by these tweets.

The first tweet is positive for someone learning about options but negative if they're looking for real-time quotes or stock information. The second tweet seems like a sales pitch for Amazon's services, which could be positive as it might attract users looking for tech solutions.

In terms of overall sentiment, combining both tweets: the first is more informative and helpful, while the second is about products or services. So, maybe it leans towards neutral? Or maybe slightly positive because one tweet helps options learners and another supports Amazon's products. But without knowing the target stock, I'm not sure how to combine these into a single sentiment.

Wait, the user mentioned that in Solving Process step (a) separate factors for each relevant tweet. The second tweet is ""rt AT_USER_MAKT der Amazonfire tvstick das fernsehangebot der kabelbetreiber überflüssig ? was denkt ihr?"" So, it's a quote from someone, implying interest or approval in something related to AMZN. That could be seen as positive.

But without knowing the exact target stock, I'm not entirely sure how to assess this. Maybe the user wants me to focus on the overall sentiment based on these tweets regardless of the target stock? But that doesn't make much sense because the impact on a specific stock would depend on other factors like company fundamentals.

I think perhaps the best approach is to acknowledge both tweets as positive in their respective contexts but note that one mentions options and the other relates to AMZN. However, without a clear target, it's hard to determine if it's overall positive or not. Maybe I should consider both tweets together: they promote various areas related to tech and finance, which are generally seen as positive for investors.

But actually, since the user provided an example response that concluded ""[Positive]"" because the first tweet is helpful but could be negative in some contexts, maybe that's a hint. The second tweet is more about products, so that's definitely positive. So combining both, I think it leans towards positive overall sentiment."
2015-04-06,Neutral,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided 11 tweets and asked me to determine if each is positive, neutral, or negative in terms of affecting the stock's future price.

First, I need to look at each tweet individually. But wait, looking at them closely, all the tweets are repeats: ""rt AT_USER..."" with URLs like gddy $ unh $ amzn, fb $ nflx, aapl, amzn, regn, biib, celg URL stocks URL"". 

Hmm, these seem to be trying to link me to a specific stock's video or info. But wait, they all have the same URL format: [greek letters] $ [something] [$ symbol]. That makes me think these tweets might be pointing towards a particular company, possibly in tech or finance since those are the keywords like gddy, nflx, aplx, etc.

Since all 11 tweets are similar, maybe they're trying to tell users that I've checked out some information related to certain stocks. But if each tweet is about different stocks (like gddy, nflx, aplx, amzn, regn, biib, celg), it's hard to know the exact impact without more context.

The user mentioned the steps: identify the target stock symbol and analyze the tweets by separating factors into positive and negative. Then assess sentiment on each tweet. Finally, combine them for an overall summary.

But in this case, all the tweets are about checking links or related information rather than making statements or opinions. So maybe they're just trying to inform the user that I've checked certain URLs.

So, if it's trying to guide me through steps or check something, perhaps it's neutral because it's not expressing a positive or negative opinion but more like providing information.

Alternatively, if these tweets are suggesting that I should watch some videos on specific stocks, maybe it's a bit more towards positive if they're encouraging content consumption. But without clear statements about the stock performance, it's hard to say.

I think since all the tweets are in the same structure and repeating similar URLs, they might be trying to tell me not to worry or check something related, so perhaps that's neutral."
2015-04-07,Positive,"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine the impact of given tweets on the stock price of Amazon (AMZN) and decide whether it's positive, neutral, or negative.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet: ""closed $ amzn calls for - $ 11 / ea ."" The word ""calls"" suggests a call option related to Amazon, so the target stock is AMZN.

Next, I'll analyze each relevant tweet separately and then combine their effects.

The second tweet is ""$ amzn revenue is increasing . chart : URL URL"". Revenue growth is positive because companies growing more means investors are likely happy. The mention of a chart indicates they have some visual data on performance, which adds to the confidence in the trend.

Now, considering each factor:

1. **Positive Factors**: Calls for Amazon and increased revenue.
2. **Negative Factors**: None mentioned here. However, the second tweet has URLs, which might not directly affect the stock price but could indicate more detailed information about their performance.

Each positive factor (+) contributes to positive sentiment. Since both factors are strong, especially the increasing revenue which is a fundamental indicator of profitability and future potential, it should have a significant positive impact on AMZN's stock.

Combining these, all positive factors suggest that Amazon will likely perform well, leading to a positive overall sentiment."
2015-04-08,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, the target stock is AMZN. For each tweet, I'll extract relevant factors and assess sentiment.

1. ""rt AT_USER mt AT_USER $ amzn's gonna be around for a longggg time given the affinity that millenials have to it . URL"" – This seems neutral because it expresses optimism without any positive or negative cues.
2. ""$ amzn - netflix : the bear thesis is a house of cards URL"" – The bear thesis suggests a decline in stock prices, so this is negative.
3. ""$ amzn stock forum updated wednesday , april 8 , 2015 10:07 : 07 am $ flt $ rad $ f $ fxi URL"" – No clear sentiment here; just a regular tweet without positive or negative language.
4. ""$ am zn quote , 12:47 pm : 381.05 +6.64 ( +1.77 % ) . "" – Positive because it shows a rise in price with an increase of 1.77%.
5. ""AT_USER since AT_USER comments ' $ zu is no $ amzn "" on 3/10 , $ zu has moved up 10 % and breaking out , he's right , $ am zn is up 1 %"" – This seems positive, noting that another user is mentioning a concern about AMZN.
6. ""$ v , $ lnkd , $ am zn"" – This is an abbreviation for ""value login,"" which probably isn't related to AMZN stock.
7. ""< 1 % of prime members likely to consider other mass-market retail sites … how to counter that ? URL $ amzn"" – Negative because it's a complaint or concern about competitors.

Now, combining these thoughts: We have mixed signals—some tweets are positive, others negative. The overall sentiment seems positive with a slight dip due to the bear thesis and user comments."
2015-04-09,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of the given company. The user provided four tweets, but they don't specify which company or whether any are related. Let's see.

First tweet: ""alibaba makes strong push into mobile ecommerce and search by AT_USER $ baba $ bidu $ goog $ aapl $ amzn $ ebay URL."" This seems like a stock ticker, possibly for Alibaba (YHOO). It mentions AT_USER as a username or identifier. The mention of YHOO is significant because it could be indicating some form of investment push.

Second tweet: ""$ am zn : us investors buy large volume of URL call options ( amzn ) amazon.com inc URL sp500."" This talks about Amazon buying call options and being part of the S&P 500. This could indicate increased interest in Amazon stock, which might affect its valuation.

Third tweet: ""thursday morning market video URL covering : $ wynn , $ gpro , $ am zn , $ ssys , $ ddd , $ tsla , $ scty , $ tlt , $ yhoo , $ aapl , $ spy $ uso."" This includes several stocks like YHOO, SPY (which is YHOO), and others. It's a mix of known companies, so it could be about market participants covering these companies for their morning sessions.

Fourth tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ am zn vs $ baba . crazy chart URL URL."" Again, mentions AMZN and BABA. It looks like comparing prices or trends of these stocks. This could affect investor sentiment if they see higher or lower price points compared to competitors.

Now, considering all four tweets:

1. First tweet is about Alibaba, which could be a strong indicator for its stock.
2. Second and fourth tweets are related to Amazon and BABA, which might have significant impact based on their performance.
3. The third tweet includes several known stocks with a mix of participants, possibly indicating broader market attention.

Without specific company details, it's challenging to assess the exact impact. However, since the first tweet is about Alibaba, which could be a leading player, and others are related to Amazon or BABA, all in the tech sector, this might suggest overall positive sentiment for the stock."
2015-04-10,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to analyze the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet mentions AT_USER talking with a speaker for Amazon's first big movie URL. That sounds like positive news because it's an exciting development for Amazon and could boost investor confidence. So, I think this is a Positive factor.

2. The second tweet says Amazon is suing four sites claiming they sell positive product reviews in bulk. While the statement itself is about positive reviews, it seems like Amazon might be taking action against these sites to prevent negative reviews from spreading. That's probably not good for Amazon because it could hurt their sales and reputation. So, this is a Negative factor.

3. The third tweet mentions Netflix leading in video services but there's space for competitors. This ties into Amazon's own marketing efforts, which can build brand loyalty and customer trust. This supports Amazon, so it's Positive.

4. The fourth tweet talks about reverse showrooming where customers buy items online and resell them. This is something that increases supply, potentially benefiting Amazon, but not sure if it directly affects price unless demand increases. Still, this could be a positive factor by boosting inventory.

5. The fifth tweet provides the last price of Amazon on a specific date. While stock prices can fluctuate based on news, this doesn't indicate a change in sentiment or any company performance. It's just a data point; no info about whether it went up or down.

6. The sixth tweet lists Christine Short's picks for the next five stocks, saying they're poised to beat the street. This is speculative and doesn't provide any concrete information about Amazon's performance relative to others. So, it's probably not relevant here.

Now, combining these factors: Positive due to exciting news, Negative from potential competitors, Neutral regarding Netflix, and Neutral about the price data. Overall, some positive points but mixed with negatives. But I don't think all negative factors outweigh the positives. Maybe overall sentiment is leaning towards [Neutral] because while Amazon does have some positive developments, there are also concerns about competition and a lack of concrete info."
2015-04-11,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price for Amazon (AMZN). Let me start by breaking down each tweet.

The first tweet says, ""don't underestimate the value of twitch $ amzn is and always will be a long play pickwinners URL."" That sounds like it's talking about something related to tech or maybe a video. I know that picky people sometimes use abbreviations for stock picks, so maybe this tweet is making the reader think Amazon is a good pick.

The second tweet includes several financial indicators: djia, spx, compq, etc., all with dollar signs. These are indexes like the Dji 300 (dji), S&P 500 (sp500) or Comp qng (comp qng). I remember that AMZN is a big part of the DJI and also has a significant market cap. Plus, it's part of the S&P 500. So this tweet might be indicating some level of confidence based on these indices.

Both tweets are talking about financial indicators and AMZN being involved in them. They're both positive in nature. The first one seems more general, while the second is specific to the stock indicators. Investors often look at these metrics because they can gauge a company's performance relative to broader markets. If all the signs point to good growth potential, it might boost Amazon's stock.

Since both tweets are focusing on AMZN and its participation in various financial indices, this suggests that people believe AMZN is undervalued or has strong fundamentals. They might be making a long-term investment decision based on these metrics.

Putting it together, the sentiment seems positive because of the information provided, so I'll go with [Positive]."
2015-04-12,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company based on the given information.

First, I need to extract the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the tweets provided:

1. The first tweet mentions platinum members seeing gains in penny stocks over 1400%. It says ""go platinum"" and lists URLs for different stocks.
2. The second tweet seems to be a mix of random links like rt AT_USER $ amzn amzn, but it doesn't specify the stock symbol.
3. The third tweet mentions that $ amzn is denying a public cloud exit but wants to avoid competing with giants.

Now, let's analyze each tweet step by step for factors and sentiment.

Starting with the first tweet: ""platinum members saw penny stock picks gain over 1400 % in 4 months ! go platinum : URL $ orcl $ yhoo $ amzn"". This suggests that platinum members are seeing gains in penny stocks, which could be positive because it's a small-cap company. Penny stocks tend to have higher growth potential and might see significant price increases. The mention of ""go platinum"" implies they're looking to jump into the big caps or international stocks, which is a positive signal for investors looking to accelerate growth.

Moving on to the second tweet: It seems to be unrelated with a lot of random links about forex, commodities, gold, oil, and eurusd. Without a specific stock symbol, it's hard to determine the impact on any particular company's performance. This uncertainty might make it difficult to assess whether this tweet is positive, neutral, or negative towards any stock.

The third tweet says $ amzn is denying a public cloud exit but wants to avoid competing with giants. Public cloud companies are in the tech sector, and if they're exiting publicly, it could affect their market share and profitability. However, the user is concerned about avoiding competition from larger companies like giants. This suggests that there's a potential trade-off between taking a slice of the market or risking more losses if competitors emerge. Investors might be cautious here, but without knowing whether amzn is facing a tough new competitor in the cloud space, it's hard to pin down a clear positive or negative sentiment.

Now, considering each tweet:

1. The first tweet provides concrete information about penny stocks and the behavior of platinum members. This could lead some investors to take a position in the stock, indicating a possible positive impact.
2. The second tweet is too vague without a stock name. Since it's speculative and lacks specificity, it doesn't directly affect any stock.
3. The third tweet is more about a potential business strategy for amzn regarding cloud services. If they're avoiding competitors, it could mean either positive news (if they expect better market conditions) or neutral if the environment isn't favorable.

Putting this together, while the first tweet suggests potential gains in penny stocks, which are often seen as low-cost, the third tweet introduces a strategic consideration about cloud companies. This might indicate that amzn is looking to avoid direct competition but could also affect their own performance by gaining access to resources or clients. Without knowing the broader economic environment, it's challenging to decide if this is a positive or negative shift.

Considering all these factors, I think there are both possible positive and neutral impacts based on different interpretations of the tweets. The first tweet could lead some investors positively, while the third suggests caution but might not have a clear overall impact yet."
2015-04-13,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price using only [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

Starting with tweet 1: ""$ amzn - if you absolutely must own retail , look for debt-free dividend payers URL."" Hmm, this seems like a warning about the importance of selecting the right stocks. It mentions ""debt-free dividend payers,"" which could imply that the company is risk-averse. I should consider whether this affects investor sentiment positively or negatively.

Next, tweet 2 talks about ""iaas + $ amzn , but how long til $ hp concedes openstack defeat to $ rht ... URL."" The mention of OpenStack isn't directly related to Amazon. It seems like a hypothetical scenario where the company plans to win against another competitor. This could create uncertainty and might influence investor confidence.

Tweet 3 is ""$ amzn URL inc . acquires technology company shoefitr URL."" Acquisition activity often leads to positive sentiment because it can indicate growth potential or new market reach. However, acquiring a tech company that might not directly relate to Amazon's core business could be seen as a drag on the stock price if it affects diversification.

Tweet 4 is ""rt AT_USER amazon to begin testing new delivery drones in the us - gizmag URL."" This tweet seems like a motivational message for Amazon. Starting a new project or initiative can boost morale and expectations, which typically leads to positive sentiment. However, not everyone might agree, but the general trend here is positive.

Tweet 5 is ""rt AT_USER weekend review video : $ spy $ iwm $ qqq $ tlt $ ibb $ aapl $ amzn $ baba $ bidu $ fb $ twtr $ feye $ gild $ googl $ nflx $ pcln $ tsla h …"" This looks like a promotional video or article about a company's performance. It could be an update on Amazon's stock, which might affect sentiment positively if the info is accurate and positive.

Tweet 6 mentions ""$ amzn showing bullish technicals with support at $ 377.90."" Technical analysis by itself can influence sentiment, but it's often not enough to tip the balance without more context. It could be that technical indicators are favorable, but there might still be other factors at play.

Tweet 7 is ""$ amzn - amazon : le service ' x-ray ' va être généralisé . URL."" This seems like a statement about a company change in focus or strategic direction. If X-ray becomes a more integrated part of the company, it could improve their business model but might also lead to increased complexity, which might be seen as negative by investors if it unduly affects performance.

Now, I need to assess each tweet's impact:

1. Warning about selecting stocks with debt issues – seems like a warning, so slightly negative.
2. Hypothetical scenario for winning OpenStack – could create uncertainty but not directly affecting Amazon's business; maybe neutral or low negative.
3. Acquisition activity – strong positive but might be offset by other factors.
4. Motivational message – positive but context matters.
5. Promotional video – can affect sentiment, possibly positive.
6. Technical analysis – support at a certain price point, but without context it's uncertain; could be neutral or low negative.
7. Strategic change – depends on whether it leads to better performance; could be positive or slightly negative.

Overall, the strongest factors are tweet 3 and 4, which are very positive. However, some tweets like 2 and 6 might not have as strong of an impact. It's a mix of positive and mixed signals. But considering that most tweets have a slight positive angle, I think overall sentiment is leaning towards positive but with some minor negatives."
2015-04-14,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets about the stock price of AmZN and figure out if it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol in the first tweet: $ yhoo $ amzn $ fb $ v. So the main symbols here are YHOO, AMZN, FB, and V. Hmm, that seems like a mix of different companies. Maybe I should look for something else instead. Wait, maybe it's a typo or multiple stocks being referred to? Let me see.

Looking at the second tweet: $ amzn : URL launches free x-ray service on fire tv : URL. It mentions an app called ""x-ray service on fire tv."" That sounds like a product name, but how does that relate to stock price analysis? Maybe it's just a business news item unrelated to AmZN.

The third tweet is even longer: scrap your $ amzn ! ! ! earn 6 % a month with our ' top 10 hedge fund ' artificial intelligence > URL AT_USER $ spy $ usd. So, they're suggesting that they'll decrease their investment in Amazon by spending 6% a month using AI from the top 10 hedge funds. That seems like a financial statement or a suggestion to reduce portfolio exposure.

Now, I need to extract factors: positive and negative. The user is decreasing their investment, which could be seen as reducing position, but also potentially taking on more risk if they're spreading investments across multiple hedge funds. 

As for sentiment, the tweet suggests a plan to cut costs and manage risk through AI, implying they might make decisions based on data or strategy. That's generally considered positive because it shows proactive thinking in finance.

Combining these factors: there are both negative aspects like reducing investment, but also positive aspects of strategic planning. However, overall sentiment seems to lean towards positive as the user is actively considering financial strategies and making informed decisions."
2015-04-15,Neutral,"Alright, I'm going to try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price. Let me start by breaking down each tweet.

The first tweet says ""URL inc.'s $1 drone delivery won't happen: Bruce Turkel $ Amzn URL."" Hmm, it mentions that a drone delivery deal isn't happening. I know that Cloudflare is known for cloud services and they sometimes partner with companies like Amazon. The mention of $1 drones could be a red flag because I remember hearing about issues with cloud providers, especially when dealing with small items like drones. This might lead me to think it's negative.

The second tweet is ""Members saw our penny stock picks gain 1600% in 4 months! Subscribe here for new picks: URL $ Amzn $ MCox $ Goog."" It sounds exciting because someone is saying their picks went up a lot. I know that prices going up can be positive, but sometimes companies can manipulate stock prices artificially to attract investment. However, the mention of ""penny stocks"" might indicate that they're low in value or overpriced. Additionally, the link for new picks suggests it's part of a marketing strategy, which could make sentiment positive.

Now, combining these two tweets. The first one is negative because drone deliveries aren't happening, which is a problem. The second tweet has mixed feelings—high excitement and a link to ""new picks,"" which might imply that the stock is performing well in a market context, making it seem positive. But the initial negative factor could outweigh this positive aspect.

Considering all factors, I'm leaning towards a neutral overall sentiment because while there are some positive elements, the negative tweet about drone deliveries likely has a more significant impact on investor confidence and thus the stock price."
2015-04-16,Negative,"Okay, so I have to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by going through each tweet one by one.

The first tweet says there was an earnings model mixed for Amazon ahead of their release next week, which is tough to get a read on the earnings. That sounds like bad news because earnings can affect investor sentiment positively or negatively. So that might be a negative factor.

Next, the second tweet mentions that $HPQ and $AMZN are ramping up due to a blowout quarter on May 6th, 2015. That's interesting because it was a specific event in 2015, so maybe this is about a significant event. I should consider if there were any positive developments around that time.

The third tweet talks about Amazon being hacked last week but not notifying customers. I'm not sure how to evaluate the impact of that on stock price right now because it's about the current situation and not necessarily future expectations.

Fourth tweet is about a user who forgot $AMZN and made 6% a month using their top 10 hedge funds with AI. That seems like a positive story, especially if the hedge fund performance was good. It could boost investor confidence.

Fifth tweet mentions investing in the three best stocks for consumer services. This is definitely about potential investments, which can influence stock price by affecting investor decisions to buy or hold.

The sixth tweet has lots of new research posts and charts on a site related to $SYN, $OIH, etc., but nothing directly about Amazon or its earnings. Maybe this could be neutral if it's just background info without specific predictions.

Now, I need to assess each tweet for positive or negative factors. First tweet is definitely negative regarding future earnings, so that's negative. The second tweet seems like a significant event in 2015 which might have happened and has already occurred, but now I'm not sure if it's about the stock price direction. Third tweet is about current security issues, but again, no specific impact on future prices. Fourth tweet is definitely positive as it mentions successful investments. Fifth tweet relates to potential actions by investors affecting stock trends. Sixth tweet is more general.

Putting this together, negative tweets are 1 and 3. Positive are 4 and 5. Neutral is none since they all have some content that's not directly about the stock but related to investments or market movements."
2015-04-17,Positive,"Alright, let's try to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of AmZN. I'm not an expert, but I'll go through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions a URL imryano launching and talks about amzn float at $800 million, which seems like good news for investors. That's positive.
2. The second tweet lists big tech companies for earnings next week. Earnings are usually important indicators of future performance. So, positive sentiment here.
3. This tweet is critical. It says that if AmZN can't maintain a 1-day SMA at $381, it might affect options. That's interesting because traders care about volatility and how much their positions could swing. Positive for traders, but what does it mean for the stock price? Maybe a bit of a bearish note.
4. The third tweet talks about RT@user mentioning Amzn expecting a bullish trend on Tuesday. That seems like good news for Amzn's stock because higher expectations can drive prices up. Positive sentiment here.
5. Another tweet mentions that option millionaires are beating Trumans' 321 point target. This could affect Amzn's options trading, but I'm not sure how much it directly impacts the stock price unless they think high stock prices would attract buyers. That might be a bearish outlook because higher stock prices can be intimidating for investors.
6. The tweet takes a moment to breathe and mentions $amzn at 378. Just an update, not much on its own; still positive but maybe a bit of a dip since it's below the 50-day moving average? Not sure yet.
7. This one says Amzn may buy small lots, feeling cooler today but still hurting. That could mean Amzn is cautious about big moves due to fear of large purchases causing volatility. Maybe mixed sentiment here—partially positive but with some uncertainty.
8. This tweet includes several stock symbols for news. It's a bit vague and not giving much context, so it doesn't add much to the overall picture.

Putting all these together: The first tweet is very positive with good float numbers. Second and fourth tweets are about earnings, which can push prices up. Tweet 7 introduces some uncertainty but still holds Amzn in check. Tweet 5 suggests options may be impacted by high stock prices, which could be a bearish factor. Tweet 3 adds to the bullish expectation for Amzn's trend. Overall, while there are mixed factors, many point towards positive sentiment because earnings and future trends are major factors influencing stock prices."
2015-04-18,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at tweet 1, it mentions ""how dr . strangelove taught us to stop worrying and love amazon."" It seems like the target stock is Amazon (AMZN), as it's a well-known company mentioned in this context. The other tweets are about ETFs or individual stocks, so I might need to see how AMZN affects these.

Next, for each tweet, I have to separate positive and negative factors. Tweet 1 talks about dr. strangelove teaching us about Amazon, which could be a positive factor as it's a significant company. The other tweets are about ETFs like ESRX, PM, RCL, MSFT, APLF, AMZN, JNJ, GOOG, PG, and SNO.

Now, evaluating the sentiment for each tweet: Tweet 1 is very positive because of the mention of dr. strangelove and the teaching aspect. It's likely to boost investor confidence. Tweets 2 and 3 are about ETFs with specific stocks. For example, ESRX is Amazon's ESG ETF, so a positive tweet might attract funds into AMZN.

Considering all these factors—positive mentions from tweet 1, a mix of positive (AMZN) and some negative ones like MSFT (-10.4%) and intc (-10.53%), but overall the market has a slight upward trend as ETFs tend to go up when companies perform well. The fact that some ETFs are down suggests mixed sentiment about specific sectors, but the positive tweet might tip the balance slightly in Amazon's favor.

Putting it all together, while there are some negative factors, the positive tweet and overall market trends suggest a slight increase. So, I lean towards a [Positive] sentiment overall."
2015-04-19,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out how these tweets affect Amazon's stock price and give a positive, neutral, or negative conclusion. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually.

First tweet: ""rt AT_USER amazon expands in atlanta . will add up to 200 jobs in buckhead , as it grows its aws business . URL $ amzn"". This seems positive because Amazon is expanding in Georgia and adding jobs, which suggests growth. Also, AWS is a major tech company, so the expansion makes sense.

Second tweet: ""stocks to watch : $ amzn : URL via AT_USER"". Just mentions that they're watching Amazon stock, but it's not specific about any changes or news related to the stock. So maybe this doesn't add much information.

Third tweet: ""$ ppch percent change updated sunday , april 19 , 2015 5:06 : 54 pm $ ibb $ kmi $ iwm $ amzn URL"". It updates a percentage change for Amazon on April 19, 2015. Since it's from a specific date in the past, it might not be relevant to today's stock price unless we're talking about historical performance.

Fourth tweet: ""6 top tech earnings previews this week : ibm , google , qualcomm , microsoft ... … URL amazon • $ amzn URL"". This is all about future earnings for other companies, including Amazon. It suggests that Amazon may not perform as well in the near term because of these earnings projections. That could lead to negative sentiment.

Fifth tweet: ""rt AT_USER my video URL stock market analysis 4/18 / 15 $ spy $ nflx $ aapl $ baba $ iwm $ smh $ amzn $ xlf $ tlt $ ibb"". This looks like a regular stock market analysis post. It's about the market in general and maybe some tech stocks, but not specifically Amazon.

Now, combining all these thoughts: The first tweet is positive because of expansion plans and AWS. The fourth tweet suggests Amazon might struggle due to earnings projections from other companies. The fifth tweet mentions stock market analysis for a broader market. So overall, there are conflicting information—some good news, some bad news. It's hard to tell if the overall sentiment is positive or negative without more context."
2015-04-20,Positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price of Amazon. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the target stock is Amazon (AMZN). I'm looking at 10 tweets here. Each tweet might have positive or negative factors that could influence investor sentiment towards AMZN's future performance.

Let's go through each tweet one by one:

1. **New post**: It mentions stock market recap with multiple stocks and URLs. Not sure about the content, but it seems like a regular stock market update. It might be neutral since it's just updating.

2. **Our stock pick on $ thcz is up...**: This looks like a sales pitch or offer for AMZN. Positive because they're boosting their stock price with a good deal.

3. **AT_USER amzn reporting earnings Q1 2015**: Earnings results are always important. Positive factors could lead to higher stock prices, so this suggests positive sentiment.

4. **rt AT_USER foreign companies most at risk from chinese law**: This could be negative because if there's a law that harms foreign companies, it might affect their performance or lead to regulations that Amazon has to comply with. So, this is negative.

5. **Cover Aapl, buy Amzn ... more stock tips and details...**: Trading actions can sometimes indicate investor sentiment, but without knowing the context, it's hard to say if it's positive or negative. It might be neutral.

6. **Notable monday option activity**: Options trading often moves in a particular direction. But unless there's a clear trend in options prices, it's ambiguous. Maybe mixed, so perhaps neutral.

7. **A few more of interest...**: Multiple stock names here, but no clear positive or negative info. It could be neutral.

8. **Amzn oscar obamacare-fueled growth gets big boost**: The mention of obamacare being a blocker makes sense, and boosting AMZN's growth. Positive because solving this issue is beneficial.

9. **rt AT_USER earnings calendar: mlnx ... multiple companies...** This suggests that AMZN is reporting good earnings. Positive factors can boost stock prices.

10. **145 companies report earnings this week**: More positive news about AMZN and others, but it's a lot of data without context on how it affects them individually.

Now, compiling the analysis:

- Positive tweets: 2, 3, 8
- Negative tweets: 4, 7, 9
- Neutral tweets: 5, 6, 10

There are 5 positive and 3 negative. The number of positives is higher than negatives, so overall sentiment seems positive.

But wait, tweet 4 and 7 are contradictory. If they're conflicting about the same stock, it could make the overall analysis tricky, but since both mention AMZN's earnings, which is a significant point for investors, that's a mixed factor. However, the number of positives outweighs negatives significantly (5 vs 3). 

So, despite some negative tweets, the positive ones are in excess. I'll lean towards a [Positive] overall sentiment."
2015-04-21,Neutral,"Okay, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on Amazon's stock price. I'm not very familiar with all the terms used in financial news, but I'll do my best.

First, looking at tweet 1: ""$ amzn close URL"". This seems like a simple request to check the current price of Amazon. It doesn't mention anything about positive or negative factors, so probably neutral.

Tweet 2 talks about jobs everywhere but making a living is tough with some specific stock prices mentioned. This could be a minor update on their financial performance, so maybe neutral again.

Tweet 3 mentions red to green in their social media and says they dropped onto a ""sloppy tape."" Not sure what that means, but it's a minor comment, probably not impacting the stock strongly.

Tweet 4 is about Amazon updating some options contracts. The user is buying calls on June $450 calls, selling others, with no immediate mention of positive or negative info, so neutral.

Tweet 5 says they've launched a B2B business in India on Alibaba. This could be a strategic move to expand into another market, which might improve their reputation and future stock price. But it's just one tweet, not enough to decide overall sentiment.

Tweet 6 mentions that Amazon is disappointing today. Without specific reasons, this is vague and hard to assess for impact.

Tweet 7 discusses how Amazon's grocery stores affected books on different platforms. This seems like a side note or unrelated information, so probably doesn't affect the stock.

Tweet 8 says Amazon raised their price target ahead of earnings. Price targets are usually about future performance expectations, which can influence investor sentiment but might not be a direct sign that the stock is up or down yet.

Tweet 9 talks about Amazon's relative volume compared to Nasdaq and NDX indices. Volume can indicate trading activity, but unless there are trends in these indices, it's hard to link to Amazon's stock performance.

Putting all this together, the main points from tweets 4-7 seem like they could be minor news, and tweet 9 is about market volume. The positive tweet 8 gives expectations of better earnings, which can sometimes indicate future increases but isn't conclusive on a day-to-day basis. Therefore, I think there's a mix of neutral and slightly positive factors, leading me to conclude Neutral."
2015-04-22,Positive,"Okay, I need to figure out how to analyze the given tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided specific steps they followed: identify the target stock symbol from each tweet, separate positive and negative factors in each tweet, assess sentiment by evaluating how each factor might influence investor sentiment, and then combine these analyses into an overall sentiment summary.

Looking at the tweets given:

1. ""Vale 1Q iron-ore output a record $ amzn url url url""

So, the target stock here is "" Vale"". I remember that VTEA is the ticker symbol for Vale Group (a coal company), but let me check—yes, Vale Group is listed on the NASDAQ, which includes many large companies. So, the stock in question is Vale.

Now, I need to process each tweet one by one.

First tweet: ""Vale 1Q iron-ore output a record $ amzn url url url""

Breaking this down:

- The user mentions that Vale's Q4 iron-oxide production was a record-breaking achievement. This indicates positive news about their coal production.

- The next part is ""$ am zn url url url"". I think these might be links or URLs, perhaps related to Valence stock (VTR) because Valence Group is another major company on the same list. But it's unclear if this refers to Vale or VTR. 

Assuming the $ sign might denote a price movement or quote, so ""$ amzn"" could mean Vale's stock closed higher, possibly around $2900 as mentioned earlier.

Putting it together: The tweet is positive because it's talking about an achievement in iron-ore output and mentions Valence (VTR), which is another company. Therefore, this tweet suggests that Vale is doing well, which would likely positively impact its stock price.

So the factors here are Positive (iron-ore production) and presumably VTR performing well. The sentiment is positive.

Are there any negative factors in this tweet? There doesn't seem to be anything like earnings reports or bad news; it's more about production. So no negative factors.

Overall, the tweet is positive because it highlights good performance of both Vale and Valence, which could indicate positive momentum for Vale.

Wait, but I should consider if ""iron-ore output"" in Q4 is a big deal. Iron-oxide is a key component for coal production, so a record output would be a good sign. Also, VTR being a major player, especially given their market capitalization, might see increased trading volume and price impact.

So, the overall sentiment is positive because of both good news about production and mention of another company in the same sector."
2015-04-23,Negative,"Alright, I need to figure out how the given tweets affect the stock price of Amazon. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I look at the target stock symbol, which is AMZN. Now, looking at each tweet:

1. The first tweet says ""$ amzn twitter to sell atlanta hawks tickets via tweets - analyst blog URL."" Hmm, that sounds like a personal message trying to promote selling tickets on Twitter, but it's not clear if it's related to Amazon or the Atlanta Hawks. It seems disconnected.

2. The second tweet is ""$ amzn - mcdonald's corporation looks more like this failing retailer every day URL."" This tweet is about Amazon looking worse as McDonald's improves. I know that both companies are in tech, but I'm not sure how their performances would impact each other. Maybe they move together? Or perhaps it's a hypothetical scenario for analysis.

Both tweets don't provide clear information about the stock price of AMZN. The first one seems like promotional content, and the second is speculative about a trend. They both don't mention anything about Amazon's earnings, revenue growth, or any positive news related to the company. 

Since there's no direct information about the stock performance, I can't determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative. Therefore, the sentiment analysis is inconclusive."
2015-04-24,Negative,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet says ""this is what was moving premarket"" with several stocks listed. It doesn't specify if that means positive or negative news for Amazon, so I can't tell much from this one.

2. The second tweet talks about AT_USER flirting with 5,100 users on Google and mentioning URLs related to the stock. There's no explicit information here about what the user is doing or how it affects Amazon.

3. The third tweet mentions buying $AMZN at a specific price in 2015-04-24 18:03:37 UTC, which doesn't seem related to current market conditions but might be historical context.

4. The fourth tweet says that AMZN's stock is set to open above its intraday high. This could mean it's on the upswing or maybe a correction, but without more info, it's hard to say.

5. The fifth tweet mentions that $AMZN and others are good for the portfolio. It doesn't specify how they're doing or if it's positive or negative sentiment towards Amazon.

6. The sixth tweet talks about being riddled with ""asshineoles,"" which is a strong negative phrase, suggesting low attention or criticism from users.

7. The seventh tweet suggests that if AMZN didn't do stock splits, it would trade higher. It doesn't provide context on what happened, so I can't assess the sentiment.

8. The eighth tweet shows the stock's price change (+57.18% from 447.17). Positive price movement, but without knowing if that's good or bad for Amazon depends on their overall performance.

9. The ninth tweet says AMZN sales under 10% growth in Q1. That suggests improvement, which is positive news, but again, it's hard to connect to the stock price directly.

10. The tenth tweet lists $AMZN, NFLX, and $MSFT as big winners. These are likely other companies, not necessarily related to Amazon.

11. The eleventh tweet says AT_USER is flirting with 5,100 users on Google and the URLs. No info about AMZN here.

12. The twelfth tweet mentions foreign companies at risk of Chinese law. If there's any uncertainty or regulatory issue affecting them, that could impact Amazon negatively if the company is a vendor or competitor.

13. The thirteenth tweet talks about top stock stories at midday with several tech stocks and other cryptocurrencies. It seems like it might be about current events impacting the market but doesn't specify Amazon's position.

14. The fourteenth tweet is in Arabic and just says to $AMZN, $MSFT, etc., with no specific content related to Amazon.

Putting this all together, most tweets are talking about news that affects other companies or general tech trends without significant mention of AMZN itself. Some might suggest positive movements but without clear context on AMZN's performance, it's hard to determine a strong impact. The worst part is the sixth tweet which explicitly mentions ""asshineoles,"" which could indicate negative sentiment from users. However, without knowing how that affects Amazon's stock price, I can't say for sure if this is positive or negative.

So, considering all these factors, while there are some negative tweets that might hint at a reaction against AMZN, the majority of them don't directly relate to Amazon's performance. Therefore, the sentiment seems neutral because the information provided isn't enough to confidently predict the stock price impact."
2015-04-25,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether each tweet is positive, negative, or neutral in terms of its impact on the stock price of Amazon. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

1. **tweet 1**: It mentions comparing Microsoft and Amazon's cloud businesses. This could either boost or hurt Amazon if they're a competitor. Not sure yet.
2. **tweet 2**: Talks about Xerox surging, Amzn down, Bby heating up, SBUX going up. There's some mixed feelings here—maybe positive for Amzn because it's rising, but negative elsewhere.
3. **tweet 3**: Sees Amazon's valuation as a thesis pushing extremes. That might make people think Amzn is undervalued or overvalued, which could be positive or neutral.
4. **tweet 4**: Says it's official that Amazon has the strongest cloud business. That sounds like good news for Amzn, so this is likely positive.
5. **tweet 5**: Similar to tweet 4; emphasizing that Amazon has a strong cloud business—positive impact on Amzn.
6. **tweet 6**: Upgrades Amazon by RJDMR, which can boost the stock. Positive sentiment.
7. **tweet 7**: Jeff Bezos is making more sales, which supports Amzn. Positive for Amzn.
8. **tweet 8**: Stock rating up significantly—positive news.
9. **tweet 9**: Same as tweet 5 and 6; Amazon's strong cloud business boosts Amzn positively.
10. The stock pick goes up a lot from the initial price, which is positive.
11. Refers to implications of AWS being profitable for Amzn—but doesn't specify what they're doing with it. Could be neutral or even positive if it's expanding into more areas.
12. Points out that investors are losing sight of the big picture—could mean negative sentiment as people might start looking elsewhere.
13. Same as tweet 7 and 6; Bezos' sales boost Amzn positively.
14. A list of Nasdaq stocks, including Amzn—it's an update about the overall market but doesn't directly impact a specific stock.
15. Positive statement about Amzn—this is definitely positive.
16. Relative volume data for spy and ndx—volume can sometimes indicate market sentiment, but not sure if it's strong enough to be positive here.
17. Says that baba, amzn, ebay, grpn are the most popular platforms for buying stuff online—it doesn't mention Amzn's performance or stock price impact.

Now, considering all these, most tweets point towards Amzn being a positive entity—upgrades, upvotes from Bezos sales, higher stock ratings. But some talks about competitors or broader market issues can be neutral or slightly negative. For example, tweet 2 has mixed reactions because other companies are affected. But overall, the strongest points are positive, so I think the sentiment is positive."
2015-04-26,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out the overall impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. It seems like ""amazon"" is consistently mentioned across multiple tweets, so that's clear. 

Now, looking at each tweet individually:

1. The first tweet mentions that Google Maps and Apple Maps have gone up for sale, but it doesn't provide specific information about Amazon. It just says ""the only legitimate competitor."" Since there's no direct mention of Amazon, I'm not sure how this affects their stock price.

2. The second tweet talks about a user revealing how profitable cloud services can be. It mentions Amazon and others like Apple, Google, etc., with percentages. This seems to suggest that the company is competitive in terms of offering cloud computing services, which could influence investor sentiment. But without specific positive or negative news related to Amazon alone, it's hard to assess.

3. The third tweet provides a breakdown of financial figures over the last four weeks for various companies, including Amazon, Apple, Tesla, and others. This data is about market performance rather than specific information about Amazon, so maybe it doesn't directly impact Amazon's stock but could show general market trends.

4. Another tweet discusses delivering packages to cars, which might be relevant if this relates to how Amazon operates, like delivery services or inventory. But again, no direct mention of the company being affected by this statement.

5. The fifth tweet mentions several internet companies planning a webinar for April 2015. This could influence consumer behavior but doesn't specifically target Amazon's stock price directly.

Considering all these tweets, the main focus seems to be on cloud computing and financial performance. Since none of these points are about Amazon directly influencing their stock (like earnings, revenue growth, etc.), I can't confidently say there's a positive or negative impact based on these tweets alone."
2015-04-27,Positive,"Alright, so I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first two tweets mention an algorithmic analysis URL for AMZN. While they don't provide specific information about their content, mentioning AMZN suggests that their focus is on it. This could be a positive sign if they're updating the company's profile or improving services.

2. The next two tweets show $ AMZN rebasing for the China stock market and announcing moves in companies like Priceline, Orbitz, and Expedia. These are competitive moves by Amazon, which might indicate their strategic priorities or customer acquisition efforts. This could be seen as a positive sign if they're expanding into new markets.

3. The third tweet talks about AWS being profitable and discusses a report where they mentioned a hit in their 1Q QTR. This shows financial health, which is positive for investors looking to buy stocks.

4. The fourth tweet mentions a cable tv shakeup affecting several companies including CMCSA, AmZN, NFLX, APL, VZ, and DIS. It looks like Amazon is involved in the tech sector as well, which could be a good sign if they're taking on other companies for growth.

5. The fifth tweet says $ AMZN rebounded because of China's stock market URL. This suggests that there's confidence in the overall market performance, possibly positive sentiment.

6. The sixth tweet indicates AMZN is increasing its target price for P.SY, QQQ, and TQQQ stocks. This could mean higher valuations or more riskier investments, which might be seen as a negative if it affects their valuation metrics but could also influence investor sentiment towards the stock overall.

7. The seventh tweet discusses AWS profitability again from a report and mentions barron's. This reinforces the financial health of AMZN, likely improving investor confidence positively.

8. The eighth tweet talks about the cable tv shakeup affecting several companies, including CMCSA, AMZN, NFLX, APL, VZ, and DIS. Similar to tweet 4, this suggests Amazon is taking on other tech companies for growth, which could be a positive move in their global expansion strategy.

9. The ninth tweet reports that AWS was a hit in their Q1 report, with analysts still weighing the stock on the NASDAQ. Positive earnings results can boost investor sentiment positively.

10. The tenth tweet is about the Friday orb trades targeting several companies like SPY, QQQ, TQQQ, BABA, APLN, etc. This could be seen as a mix of good and bad signals for different sectors, which might neutralize any positive impacts.

11. The eleventh tweet mentions the cloud battle, with votes on AMZN, MSFT, IBM, GOGGL, orcl. This is more about competition in the cloud space, which can drive price pressures but isn't directly about Amazon's stock unless they are being bought out.

12. The twelfth tweet points to a surge in volatility for options markets as buybacks kick off. This could indicate that AMZN is seeing increased demand for derivatives, which might be a positive for their stock if there's a push towards more speculative trading or favorable news about future dividends.

Considering all these factors—positive updates on AWS profitability, strategic investments in other sectors, and higher volatility in options markets—the overall sentiment seems to be looking good. However, the twelfth tweet does suggest increased options volatility, which might pressure the stock price but is not a clear indicator of positive or negative sentiment."
2015-04-28,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to determine whether each tweet is positive, negative, or neutral in terms of impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. For example, the first tweet mentions ""amzn"" and ""url url,"" so that would be AMZN.

Next, for each relevant tweet, I need to identify positive and negative factors. 

Looking at the tweets:

1. The user mentions ""amazon goes after staples tapping into a trillion dollar market."" This sounds like positive because it's about leveraging staples as a strategy in the market.
2. Another tweet says ""$ ak $ mat $ ry $ amzn stockmarket tradeideas"" which is unclear, but maybe implying support or interest in Amazon.
3. The third tweet talks about PayPal conveying ebay's earnings, so again, a positive note on a key market player.
4. The fourth tweet mentions ""top 7 mistakes new traders make"" and lists companies like VTC,VGGL,AOM etc., which suggests critical advice for traders to avoid mistakes, indicating a negative sentiment as it may discourage trading.
5. The fifth tweet seems more general about the stock chart and trade ideas, no specific positive or negative info.
6. Another user says ""amazon goes after staples,"" similar to tweet 1, so positive again.
7. This one mentions "" allegedly sells real fur as 'fake'"" which could be misleading but might not have a clear impact on Amazon's performance unless there's some hidden effect.
8. The eighth tweet is about whether it's a blow-off top and suggests methods to tell, which is more of an analysis than sentiment. It doesn't provide positive or negative info.
9. Finally, ""apple will return $ 200 billion"" mentions a company (Apple) returning money, which could be seen as a positive investment for Amazon shareholders.

Now, summarizing each tweet:

1. Positive
2. Unclear but seems supportive
3. Positive
4. Negative (due to the trading advice)
5. General info
6. Positive
7. Hmmm, unsure about this one. The mention of real fur being sold as fake might be a red flag or humorous, not necessarily positive or negative in terms of stock price.
8. Neutral
9. Positive

Now, for each tweet's sentiment:

1. [Positive]
2. Probably [Neutral] since it's unclear but still supportive.
3. [Positive]
4. [Negative]
5. No clear sentiment; could be neutral.
6. [Positive]
7. Hmmm, I'm not sure about this one. The tweet might be controversial or humorous. Since it doesn't explicitly mention a positive or negative impact on Amazon's stock price, maybe it's [Neutral].
8. Neutral
9. [Positive]

So, combining these analyses, there are mostly neutral tweets except for some that are positive or slightly negative. I'm leaning towards the overall sentiment being [Neutral] because while there are mixed signals, the majority are neutral."
2015-04-29,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets and determine if they will affect the stock price of a company. Let's take it step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbols from the tweets: $APL, $TSLA, $TWTR, $YPF, $AMZN, $X, $PBR, $MRK, $JBLU, $ABX. Hmm, these look like multiple stocks, so maybe it's a company with several stock names listed here.

Now, for each tweet:

1. The first one says: ""rt AT_USER active options @ cboe : $ aapl $ tsla $ twtr $ ypf $ amzn $ x $ pbr $ mrk $ jblu $ abx"". This seems like a list of stock ticker symbols. Since the user is mentioning various stocks, I'm not sure what specific stock this tweet is targeting. It's probably referring to multiple companies here.

2. The second tweet: ""$ amzn - URL upgraded by vetr inc . to sell ( amzn ) URL"". So it mentions Amazon (AMZN) being upgraded and considering selling their shares via a URL. 

Considering the first tweet, if it's about several stocks, each of them is probably treated as separate entities unless there's a pattern or clue. Since the second tweet involves Amazon, which might be one of the companies mentioned in the first.

Now, evaluating sentiment: The user is suggesting that Amazon will upgrade their URL and consider selling shares via a URL. This action could affect Amazon's stock price negatively because upgrading services can sometimes increase costs, leading to potential stock price drops. 

Putting it all together, these tweets indicate the company (or companies) they're targeting are likely to see negative impacts on their stock prices."
2015-04-30,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets about the stock prices of Amzn (AMZN) and others. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First tweet: It's from April 30, 2015, but it says ""amzn news updated thursday , april 30 , 2015"". The URL is given as $ nbg $ gdx $ efa $ bidu. I'm not sure what this stands for, maybe something related to economic indicators or stock metrics.

Second tweet: It mentions thinking about the value in Google, Apple, Amazon, and others regarding their cloud values. Specifically, it says if ""crm"" is at $74. I don't recognize ""crm"", but it might be a typo for ""closure ratio"" or something similar related to cloud providers like AWS.

I'm not familiar with all the terms here, so maybe I should assume that these tweets are providing information about stock metrics or economic indicators. Since they're from April 2015, which was a significant year for tech companies but also had some economic challenges, including the financial crisis.

Without specific data points, it's hard to assess if these tweets are positive or negative. But given that April was tough, especially with the stock market doing badly and some major news about regulations, I might lean towards negative sentiment."
2015-05-01,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided two tweets and wants me to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. They also want an analysis broken down into steps, with specific instructions.

First, I need to extract the target stock from both tweets. Looking at tweet 1, it mentions ""googl,"" ""amzn,"" ""ibm,"" and others, so the target is probably Google (GOOGL). In tweet 2, AT_USER mentions selling cash in an international market and downgrading a company called ARGUS after earnings, with ""gsq"" as the stock symbol. So here, the stock might be Google again since AT_USER's actions relate to their stock.

Next, I'll analyze each tweet one by one. For tweet 1, it talks about great trades, bulls caution, and mentions several stocks like AMZN, FB, GPRO, etc., which are all in the tech sector. The phrase ""bull be careful"" suggests that bulls (investor optimism) is cautious. This could mean positive sentiment towards Google, but I'm not entirely sure yet.

Moving on to tweet 2, AT_USER sells cash and downgrades a company called ARGUS after earnings with ""gsq.""下调市价 (graded stock price) indicates negative news affecting investors. The mention of selling cash might indicate that the investor is pulling out money from their portfolio. These are both signs of negative sentiment, which could hurt Google's stock.

Now, combining these thoughts: tweet 1 is somewhat positive because it mentions multiple tech stocks, but tweet 2 adds negativity with the announcement and sale of cash. It's hard to weigh them since they're on different topics. But given that AT_USER actions are clearly negative (downgrading a company), I think overall sentiment is negative.

I should structure this in a way that shows each step clearly. First identifying the target stock, then analyzing each tweet separately, and finally combining them to get an overall conclusion. The user probably wants this for decision-making purposes, so accuracy is key here."
2015-05-02,Negative,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll look for the target stock symbol. All the tweets mention ""amzn,"" which is the ticker symbol for Amazon. That's a good start because it means each tweet is about Amazon. 

Now, I need to identify Positive and Negative factors in each tweet. Let's take them one by one.

The first tweet says: ""amzn URL inc . shares click here -> URL trending $ amzn $ fxs $ sbux $ fm amzn stockmarket …"" It mentions the stock URL, updates trends with dollar amounts, and talks about stock market. This seems positive because it's providing information and talking about trends, which can be seen as a favorable signal.

The second tweet is: ""$ crm stock forum updated friday , may 1 , 2015 11:11 : 02 pm $ hsy $ efa $ amzn $ mack URL"" It mentions the Crum Consulting (CRM) stock and talks about a forum update on May 1, 2015. Since it's talking about a forum update, that might indicate investor sentiment. However, without specific wording about positive or negative opinions, I can't be certain. It could be neutral.

The third tweet: ""AT_USER since your tweet was sent $ amzn has dropped -5.257 % . see your featured tweet on market parse URL"" This clearly states that Amazon's stock has dropped by 5.257%. This is a direct and specific negative statement, which suggests investor concern.

The fourth tweet: ""$ tmf investor opinions updated friday , may 1 , 2015 5:07 : 17 pm $ xiv $ gs $ xle $ amzn $ mack URL"" It mentions investor opinions on TMF and GM, but again, without specific words like ""positive"" or ""negative,"" it's hard to determine the sentiment. It could be neutral as well.

Now, summarizing each tweet's impact:

1. Positive: Providing a direct link to Amazon's stock.
2. Neutral: Discusses a forum update about Crum Consulting.
3. Negative: Directly states a percentage drop in Amazon's stock price.
4. Neutral: Discusses investor opinions on other companies.

The negative tweet is a clear indication of concern, so that would lean towards a Negative overall sentiment. The positive and neutral tweets are less definitive but don't outweigh the negative information provided by the third tweet.

So, putting it all together, I think the main issue comes from the third tweet, which clearly indicates Amazon's stock has dropped. That should be enough to conclude that there is a Negative impact."
2015-05-03,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query step by step. The user has provided four tweets and wants me to analyze their impact on a given company's stock price using [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at tweet 1, it says ""AT_USER the 4 traits of the perfect business . quote from jeff bezos . great share AT_USER -> URL $ amzn URL."" So, the target stock is Amazon (AMZN). The user wants me to analyze four tweets related to this.

Now, I'll go through each tweet one by one. 

 Tweet 1: ""rt AT_USER the 4 traits of the perfect business . quote from jeff bezos . great share AT_USER -> URL $ amzn URL"" – Hmm, this is more about a comment and directing to AMZN's stock price, which seems like positive information because it's giving a direct link. 

Tweet 2: ""apple will be the most dominant player by 2020 . presentation AT_USER fourhorsemen : $ amzn $ appl $ fb $ goog URL"" – This tweet is discussing an upcoming scenario where Apple (APL) could dominate, implying growth in their market share. While this is a positive statement about Apple's potential expansion or dominance, it doesn't directly mention AMZN, so I'm not sure how it affects AMZN's stock yet.

Tweet 3: ""sh proshares short s & p 500 fund filings click here -> URL trending $ sh $ swy.to $ aa $ amzn sh investing stock"" – This tweet is about S&P 500 funding and shares, but again, it doesn't mention AMZN specifically. It's more about broader market trends, so it might not directly impact AMZN's stock price.

Tweet 4: ""AT_USER since your tweet was sent $ amzn has dropped -3.710 % . see your featured tweet on market parse URL"" – This tweet is reporting a percentage drop in AMZN's share price compared to last week. It's a direct statement about the stock's performance, which would likely lead investors to expect negative sentiment from this event.

Now, considering all tweets, only the first and fourth provide specific information about AMZN. The fourth tweet directly mentions the stock drop of -3.710%, indicating investor concern. This should be considered in the overall analysis. 

Even though some tweets talk about other companies (APL, FB), they don't address AMZN's performance. Therefore, the primary impact is from the fourth tweet, which is negative. The first tweet seems to provide a link and positive commentary but doesn't directly cause the stock to drop.

So, even though there are positive statements elsewhere, the most direct and immediate information provided by the user regarding AMZN's stock is in the fourth tweet. This should tip towards a Negative overall sentiment because of the specific mention of the share price drop."
2015-05-04,Negative,"Alright, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet mentions that AMZN has dropped 1.523% after a user sent them money. That's a direct mention of a percentage drop, which probably indicates negative sentiment towards Amazon.
   
2. The second tweet talks about a blog post discussing recent developments like press releases and URLs related to specific companies. However, it doesn't explicitly state positive or negative news about AMZN.

3. The third tweet links some stock messages on the board, but again, no direct info on AMZN's performance.

4. The fourth tweet mentions 3D printing being obsolete with iPhones, which could imply that there are concerns about product adoption, potentially affecting revenue and thus stock price. This could be seen as a negative factor.

5. The fifth tweet provides investor opinions from Monday morning regarding the market, but it's unclear if this relates to AMZN specifically.

6. The sixth tweet talks about the Monday morning market minute with specific company names, but again, no direct mention of AMZN.

7. The seventh tweet discusses Jeff Bezos' earnings for the year-to-date being up $9.5 billion and mentions his other big companies. This could indicate strong earnings, which might be a positive factor for stock price.

Now, considering all these tweets, most are about investor opinions or recent events that may not provide a clear overall trend towards AMZN's performance. The first tweet is definitive with the percentage drop, while the seventh tweet speaks to future earnings, but the other tweets are more anecdotal or speculative. Combining these perspectives, I'm leaning toward a negative impact because of the direct mention in tweet one and potential concerns from the others.

So, I think the overall sentiment is Negative."
2015-05-05,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine how they'll impact Amazon's stock price and decide if it's positive, neutral, or negative.

Starting with tweet 1: ""amzn URL inc . bid size click here -> URL trending $ am zn $ vcm.to $ aem $ rsp amzn stocks stock."" This seems like an official announcement about Amazon's URL services. It looks like they're promoting their site and could be generating traffic, which might boost the stock.

Tweet 2 is about JetBlue selling shares. Selling shares would likely decrease investor confidence, possibly leading to a negative impact on the stock price.

Tweet 3 mentions the Chief financial Officer (CFO) selling shares, which might indicate reduced sentiment as they're moving away from Amazon, possibly impacting their overall performance and investor reactions.

Tweet 4 is about stock picks increasing by over 1400% in two months. This is a big positive sign because it suggests strong demand for Amazon's products or services, boosting investor interest.

Tweets 5-8 are about $AMZN's stock price trends. Positive ones might boost the stock, but some seem neutral or slightly negative.

Tweet 9 mentions a large retail inventory management system launch. This is technical and might not directly impact the stock market; it could lead to more data, which Amazon could benefit from.

Tweets 10-13 talk about delays in tax decisions on the US equities. Such delays can affect investor sentiment but may show concern rather than a clear positive or negative move.

Tweet 14 gives the close price for $AMZN. While this is important to note, it's more of an update than a tweet with sentiment analysis.

Tweets 15-20 mention various tech stocks and their charts being complete. Positive trends can boost Amazon, while negatives like a drop in TSLA might indicate concern about the overall tech sector.

Overall, there are both positive signs from stock pick increases and a couple of negative ones from stock prices dropping or other concerns. The momentum is mixed but with the largest positive coming from $AMZN. It's hard to say for sure without more context on how the stock reacts."
2015-05-06,Positive,"Alright, so I need to analyze these tweets about two companies, Cisco and Microsoft. The goal is to determine whether their stock prices are likely going up, staying the same, or down in the future.

First, I'll look at each tweet individually and break them down into factors and sentiment.

For the first tweet, ""cisco : analyzing upcoming earnings and future product strategy $ csco $ fb $ amzn $ lnkd URL"" – the main points here are that Cisco is being analyzed for their earnings and future product strategies. The link probably goes to a website, but not sure what those sites are about. So, they're focusing on the company's performance and future plans.

Next tweet: ""celg chesapeake energy corp . e . p . s . click here -> URL trending $ celg $ amzn $ dust $ gdxj celg stocks tradeideas"" – this is talking about Che槽 Energy, which seems unrelated. They're just mentioning their stock and it's being used for trading ideas. No positive or negative information here; probably a red flag.

Third tweet: ""$ msft $ crm $ orcl $ amzn : ' doubtful ' microsoft will buy salesforce : analysts : URL"" – Microsoft is mentioned, along with Salesforce. The mention of them buying something suggests they're interested in acquiring or expanding their current business. So this is definitely a positive sign because it looks like Microsoft's interests are improving.

Last tweet: ""btu peabody energy corp . news click here -> URL trending $ btu $ fxi $ amzn $ grcu btu pennystocks pennystocks"" – again, focusing on Peabody Energy. The word ""pennystocks"" is part of the stock ticker. So they're talking about a company whose shares are listed there, but not sure what that company does. No explicit positive or negative info.

Now, compiling these thoughts:

1. Cisco's tweet seems focused on their financials and future strategies – could be positive.
2. Che槽 Energy looks like a red flag since it's unrelated to the target companies being analyzed.
3. Microsoft is acquiring Salesforce, which is good for their product expansion – strong positive.
4. Peabody is being mentioned as a company whose shares are listed; no info on what they're doing.

So overall, Microsoft's interest in Salesforce is a clear positive sign. Other factors like Che槽 Energy being unrelated might not have a big impact. Therefore, the sentiment should be positive because of the acquisition."
2015-05-07,Positive,"Okay, I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the given company. Let's take each tweet one by one.

First tweet mentions YHOO hiring may draw interest from various companies like PCLN, YOHOO, AMZN, and RAKuten Inc., referring to RAKuten as ""gymnast."" This seems to indicate potential investors are interested in amassing more shares. That's a positive sign because it means there's buzz or interest leading to higher demand.

Second tweet talks about ERY being down 3x and mentions stock forum clicks on ERY, AMZN, AEM, HD, and RAKuten stocks. If ERY is underperforming by three times, that's a significant loss for the company. But since it's a forum click, maybe there are some buzz around it, but combined with the high drop, I'm not sure if it outweighs the other factors.

Third tweet suggests AT_USER, $AMZN might be the real CRM buyer, Beniofff being CEO of CRM or AWS division. This seems like a strong statement from a new user, implying that Amzn could be part of a larger company in that field. That could create excitement and attract more investors.

Fourth tweet highlights upgrades for QORVO, TESLA M OTors, etc., mentioning AMZN as well. Upgrades can sometimes signal good news, so this might boost confidence and investor sentiment.

Fifth tweet says RT AT_USER offers a free tutorial for traders. More users sharing content usually means positive engagement, which could be seen as a sign of trust or interest from the market.

Putting it all together: The first tweet is definitely positive, second has some negative news but mixed with possible buzz. Third and fourth tweets seem to imply good developments leading to potential gains. Fifth suggests user activity might boost sentiment positively. Overall, the trend seems towards increased activity and potential stock price movements upwards."
2015-05-08,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine their likely impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at each tweet:

1. ""rt AT_USER amazon rolls out an update to firefox ; aiso includes emoji , wallpaper customization - URL $ amzn URL""
This seems like Amazon is about to release something significant with Firefox and other features. I don't have much info on what that might be exactly, but it's a positive sign because new releases usually hint at improvements or new features which can boost the stock. So, this looks like a Positive factor.

2. ""rt AT_USER $ amzn files patent application for uav delivery systems URL rt AT_USER""
This tweet mentions a patent application related to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). patent applications are generally seen as positive because they show innovation and could lead to new products or market expansion, which Amazon might take advantage of. So, Positive.

3. ""$ amzn another major winner this week .""
Simple statement, but it's indicating that Amazon is doing well or has a good position relative to others. This suggests a positive outlook from the broader market. Positive again.

4. ""am zn URL inc . day high click here -> URL trending $ amzn $ biib $ ecig $ boil amzn trade ideas …""
This tweet talks about AMZN going up in price and mentions other companies' stock prices. It's talking about trends and trading ideas, which can be a mix of positive (if the tech sector is strong) and neutral (since it's speculative). The overall sentiment isn't clear yet; maybe neutral or positive based on broader market trends.

5. ""rt AT_USER post-earnings plays : $ baba , $ tsla , $ mcd . $ amzn . earnings next week : $ csco , $ gddy AT_USER w / AT_USER $ z & $ yelp URL""
This tweet talks about upcoming earnings and mentions companies like BABA, TSLA, MCD, CSU, GDDY. Earnings reports can be positive because they show confidence in the company's performance. It might lead to stock price increases but is also speculative, so maybe neutral or positive.

6. ""$ hubs stock company info click here : URL also see : $ sep $ xom $ amzn $ fce . a stockmarket trade ideas ~""
Another statement about a company's information and trading ideas. Similar to tweet 5, it's talking about trends and potential trades but not providing specific market data or news. This is a mix of positive (innovation) and speculative.

Now, combining all these factors:

- Positive tweets: 1, 2, 3, 5. These indicate that Amazon is moving forward with new products, has strong earnings, and possibly facing competition.
- Neutral tweet: 4, which touches on trends but might be too speculative without context.
- Negative tweet: 6, again speculative and about stock trading ideas.

Overall, the tweets are mixed in positive and neutral directions. However, most of them signal positive developments or improvements, especially with updates to Firefox, patent applications, earnings, etc. The lack of negative information outweighs the middle ground, so the overall sentiment seems positive."
2015-05-09,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. It seems like ""amzn"" is consistently mentioned across multiple tweets, so I can focus on Amazon.

Next, for each tweet, I should separate positive and negative factors. But since some are URLs with keywords like ""trend"", ""click here"", etc., it might be a bit tricky. However, looking at the content:

1. ""FB short sales updated saturday , may 9 , 2015 09:07 : 03 am"" – This looks like information about Facebook's short sales, which could indicate market sentiment. Maybe positive if there are fears of supply issues.

2. ""over keltner url $ sune ..."" – The URL mentions Keltner chart, a technical indicator. While it doesn't specify positive or negative, the trend can give some insight into investor behavior around stock prices.

3. ""xlp consumer staples select sector spdr day high click here -> URL trending..."" – Similar to tweet 2, mentioning technical indicators could affect sentiment, but it's hard to assess directly.

4. ""great free tutorial..."" – This is a link for a free tutorial, which doesn't seem to provide any information about the stock itself, so probably neutral.

5. ""AT_USER since your tweet was sent $ amzn has risen 3.244 % . see your featured tweet on market parse URL"" – This clearly states that Amazon's stock has increased by 3.24%, which is a direct positive indicator. This tweet seems to show an upward movement, so it adds to the positive sentiment.

6. ""mmiequ massmutual indexed equity fund class s eod data click here -> URL trending..."" – Again, mentioning a financial index suggests investor confidence, contributing positively to Amazon's outlook.

7. ""xlkt technology select sector spdr short sales click here -> URL trending..."" – Similar to tweet 3, again technical indicators which could influence market movement.

8. ""don \ ' t trade options without these key parameters"" – While not directly a positive or negative factor for Amazon stock, it might indicate that the company is more risk-averse or may have certain trading requirements, potentially affecting sentiment negatively if users are hesitant to engage in certain trades.

9. ""$ amzn why URL jumped 10 % in april"" – This tweet suggests an actual increase in Amazon's price by 10%, reinforcing a positive trend and likely adding to the stock's value.

10. ""gs golds group inc . ideas"" – The GSO group is a global financial services company, not specifically Amazon. Although it mentions trading ideas, which might imply that users are interested in similar products, this tweet doesn't directly affect Amazon's price.

Now, combining all these thoughts: Statements 5 and 9 show actual increases in stock prices. Statement 6 mentions an index, which is a positive sign but depends on the index's relevance. Statement 8 adds a risk factor. The other tweets either talk about technical indicators or are links to financial products, which can be seen as bearish if there's concern about those areas. However, since most of them are positive or indicate trends that suggest improvement, I lean towards a mostly positive sentiment.

So overall, the sentiment seems neutral because while there are some factors like technical indicators and specific index mentions, they don't outweigh the actual upward movements in Amazon's stock. The other tweets either have uncertainty about trading parameters or external financial products which could be viewed as bearish but aren't enough to significantly impact the stock price."
2015-05-10,Neutral,"Alright, let me figure out how to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. The user provided two tweets and asked for an analysis of their likely effect.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first one: ""amzn URL inc . current price click here"". It mentions Amazon, so that's clear. The second tweet is also about Amazon since it starts with ""halo"".

Now, for each tweet, I have to separate positive and negative factors. For the first tweet, the words ""current price"" and ""click here"" suggest investor interest in price movement or a call to action, which could be positive. The phrase ""URL inc."" might indicate some underlying concern about Amazon's future.

For the second tweet, it starts with ""halo"", which is a term I've heard before but isn't familiar. It says ""amzn invest..."", so that's a clear call from investors. There's no explicit mention of positive or negative factors here.

Next, assessing sentiment: the first tweet talks about price and a link, which could be neutral with a slight positive implication if they're trying to attract attention. The second tweet is more definitive, indicating strong investor interest.

Combining these, the overall sentiment seems mixed but leaning towards positive because there's a call from investors. However, it's not entirely clear if the other tweet has any negative factors that could negate the positive impact."

2015-05-12,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. So, first I need to understand what each tweet is about.

Starting with the first tweet: ""rt lawsuit filed with ny ag office against mm's for making hard to borrow $ tsla stock for short sale hft quant $ amzn $ goog $ aapl $ qqq"". Hmm, it looks like this tweet mentions a lawsuit filed against Amazon (AMZN) regarding their ability to borrow money for short selling. This could be seen as a significant event that might affect their financial health and hence their stock price.

Moving on to the second tweet: ""wmih wmi holdings corp . % change click here -> URL trending $ wmih $ gld $ amzn $ bita wmih pennystocks stockmarket"". This one seems more about financial trends and stock prices. It mentions a stock named pennystocks and talks about trends in various stocks, including Amazon. The mention of a % change might indicate that the sentiment is positive regarding the company's performance.

The third tweet: ""our stock picks have been seeing massive gains this year ! special update : URL $ amzn $ qcom $ csco"". This one is also talking about massive gains with specific stock picks, which could imply that Amazon's stock is performing well and investors might be expecting positive outcomes.

Putting it all together, the first tweet gives a direct statement against AMZN related to their financials. The second tweet discusses trends, which can influence market sentiment. The third tweet is a report on recent gains, suggesting that the overall market is favorable for Amazon. Each of these factors—financial issues, stock performance, and positive trends—are interconnected. They all contribute to building up an overall positive sentiment towards Amazon's stock price.

I should also consider external factors like company-specific news or macroeconomic events that might affect AMZN. But based solely on the given tweets, each point is contributing positively to a favorable outlook for the stock."
2015-05-13,Negative,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

The first tweet says $94,000 in one trade, but it also mentions ""url .. $ amzn $ mcox $ goog."" That doesn't give much context, just a number and some company names. I don't think this directly relates to Amazon or any other stock mentioned.

Moving on to the second tweet, it talks about cloud computing partnering with Meraas in Dubai. While partnerships can sometimes indicate potential business expansion, they also depend on market conditions. Since there's no additional info here, I'm not sure if this positively or negatively affects Amazon's price. It might be a sign that the company is developing new services but without specifics, it's hard to say.

The third tweet mentions a penny stock alert with gains over 310% in six months and suggests picking Orcl or YHOO as the new pick. Penny stocks are known for their short-term trends, and an increase could either boost Amazon or indicate potential upside. However, without specific information about Amazon's performance here, I can't assess the impact.

The fourth tweet talks about Act, Inc., which seems unrelated to Amazon. It mentions exchange clicks on a webpage, but since it doesn't provide any other info, this tweet is probably just filler and not directly related to Amazon or its stock price.

Finally, the fifth tweet says $500 billion in Walmart sales reaching that amount. Walmart's performance can affect retail companies, which might have some impact on Amazon through supply chain issues or competition. However, again, without specific information about how this relates to Amazon, it's hard to evaluate the stock's sentiment.

Putting it all together, none of these tweets provide enough details to directly influence Amazon's stock price positively or negatively. They either talk about partnerships, price increases, or unrelated topics. So my conclusion is that there's no clear impact on Amazon's future stock price."
2015-05-14,Neutral,"Alright, so I'm trying to analyze the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Each tweet starts with ""$ amzn"", which tells me that ""Amazon.com"" is the company in question. 

Next, for each tweet, I'll separate the positive and negative factors. The analysis should consider both the content of the tweet and any relevant blog posts or comments.

Looking at the tweets:

1. The first one mentions $ amzn what Verizon's aol buy means for video streaming and netflix, which seems like it might affect Amazon's revenue from video streaming services. This could impact Amazon's stock price.
2. The second tweet talks about investing in the online travel industry and asks if the portfolio needs a getaway. While this is more of a business decision rather than directly impacting Amazon, it might influence investor sentiment by suggesting diversification or financial planning.
3. The third tweet lists several retail developments with companies like $ wmt (Walmart), $ coh (Coca-Cola), etc. These are broader industries and don't directly relate to Amazon unless there's some underlying assumption about how these companies' performances affect Amazon. Maybe a correlation, but not necessarily a direct impact.
4. The fourth tweet asks if $ wmt's shipping program will drag Amazon down, referring to $ amzn. This is interesting because both are in the tech sector, so it could create a competitive environment or potential for price war. If the shipping program affects revenue, that might affect Amazon's stock.
5. The fifth and sixth tweets mention Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, which is a bit confusing. These are names of people who won the dot.com bubble. Maybe they're discussing the泡沫 in tech, but I'm not sure how that directly relates to Amazon's financials unless there's an underlying assumption about their performance.
6. The last tweet talks about $ thcz (I think it was the Chinese bank) being up 670%, which doesn't seem related to Amazon.

Now, assessing sentiment:

- The first tweet is vague but suggests a strategic decision affecting revenue, which could be positive if Amazon's streaming services are good.
- The second tweet is more about diversification and personal finance, which can be neutral or slightly negative for some investors.
- The third tweet doesn't provide enough info to assess directly.
- The fourth tweet introduces a potential competitive business move by Amazon against another tech company, which could either boost or reduce the stock depending on how it impacts the market.
- The fifth tweet's mention of Bill Gates and Warren Buffett is unclear without more context. It might be a red herring or relevant in a different way, but without clear information, it's hard to say.
- The last tweet is irrelevant.

Putting this together: The first tweet suggests Amazon could benefit from new investments, which is positive. The fourth tweet introduces a potential competitive business move, which is a risk. So overall, there seems to be mixed signals about Amazon's performance but with some uncertainty. This leads me to conclude it's a mix of positive and negative factors."
2015-05-15,Neutral,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of the company. The user provided a list of 12 tweets about Amazon's stock or related topics. I need to go through each tweet one by one, identify the positive and negative factors, assess the sentiment, and then combine everything to get an overall sentiment.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER all out on that last push up $ pcln calls up nearly 20 % since entry moments ago $ goog $ amzn $ gm $ ge $ fb $ spy $ tlt"". It's talking about the price increase and mentions multiple companies. The user seems supportive here, which might be positive for investors.

The second tweet is ""AT_USER $ am zn repricing amazon's secret sauce with netflix at $ 600 URL"". This suggests that Amazon is adjusting its prices to include Netflix's stock. That could mean it's trying to justify the price or manage costs, which might be a mix of positive and neutral.

Third tweet is similar to the second: ""rt AT_USER all out on that last push up $ pcln calls up nearly 20 % since entry moments ago $ goog $ am zn $ gm $ ge $ fb $ spy $ tlt"". It repeats the same point, emphasizing the price increase, so this seems positive.

Next tweet is another one where it says ""rt AT_USER all out on that last push up $ pcln calls up nearly 20 % since entry moments ago $ goog $ am zn $ gm $ ge $ fb $ spy $ tlt"". Again, reinforcing the same message about price increases. It's consistent with previous statements.

Then tweet number eight: ""googl amzn pulling back . nflx of course that $ 3 pb being btd again . mo going to split is props it out b4 its hard to mnpulate."" This seems like a negative tweet because it talks about pullbacks, which can hurt stock prices. It mentions Netflux and potential price drops due to other factors.

Tweets nine and ten are similar: ""rt AT_USER all out on that last push up $ pcln calls up nearly 20 % since entry moments ago $ goog $ am zn $ gm $ ge $ fb $ spy $ tlt"". They're repeating the positive point about price increases, so this reinforces the overall trend.

Lastly, tweet eleven is from TheStreet: ""thestreet : amazon echo is designed to get you to shop more , but do you like the technology ? $ amzn URL"". It's a comment on the product of Amazon Echo, which is a marketing strategy. This could be positive if it's trying to increase visibility or negative if it's seen as negative towards Amazon.

Now, putting this all together: most tweets are about price increases and customer feedback with Netflix. The pullbacks in tweet eight might offset some of that positive sentiment, but the repeated price push-ups from other tweets make the trend seem consistent. However, the mention of Netflux suggesting possible price drops adds uncertainty.

Overall, while there's a strong sentiment towards price increases, the negative tweet could create some volatility. Without more context, it's hard to say if the overall impact is positive or neutral. But considering the majority of tweets are positive and the only negative point is a pullback that might not be enough to outweigh the price gains.

So I think the overall sentiment would lean towards [Neutral] because there are both supportive and mixed signals, but it's too volatile to make a clear prediction."
2015-05-16,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

Starting with tweet 1: ""Amazon echo is designed to get you to shop more, but do you like the technology?"" This seems like a neutral opinion since it's questioning whether the company's product will satisfy its customers. It doesn't express a clear positive or negative sentiment towards Amazon.

Moving on to tweet 2: ""iwm russell 2000 ishares summary click here -> URL trending $ iwm $ amzn $ hjoe $ lnkd $ amzn iwm nasdaq tradeideas"". Here, there are multiple links and mentions of ""nasdaq."" It looks like Amazon's website is being accessed by others, which might imply interest in their services or products. This could indicate a positive trend as more people might be interested in them.

Tweet 3 says ""$ amzn - wal-mart stores , inc . wants its own amazon prime URL"". The company AMAZON is seeking to create its own Amazon Prime service. This is definitely a positive sign for Amazon, potentially boosting their stock price because it could lead to growth and increased demand for services like streaming and online shopping.

Tweet 4: ""gild gilead sciences , inc . 52wk high click here -> URL trending $ gild $ amzn $ drgv $ lbmh gild pennystocks nasdaq"". It mentions a company, GILD, which is a biologics stock. There's a link suggesting increased activity on NASDAQ and pennystocks. This could mean that there are more investors looking into this technology, which might be positive.

Tweet 5: ""Amazon wants to train young people to become cloud experts - the next web URL"". This tweet expresses a strategic goal for Amazon to invest in education or training programs for future employees. This is a clear positive action, indicating potential growth and increased innovation within the company.

Tweet 6: ""IBB biotech ishares company info click here -> URL trending $ ibb $ amzn $ myec $ abgb ibb stock invest"". Similar to tweet 2, it mentions NASDAQ. The mention of a biotechnology company could be positive if they are expanding into new sectors or products.

Tweet 7: ""DKL Dow chemical co . company info click here -> URL trending $ dkl $ luv $ amzn $ adt dkl trade ideas stockmarket"". It's talking about Dow Chemical, which is in the chemicals industry. If this company has increased investor interest or there are more projects coming out of it, that could be a positive sign.

Tweet 8: ""TCZ totally hemp crazy inc . summary click here -> URL trending $ thcz $ jci $ amzn $ aa thcz pennystocks invest"". This one mentions THC and JCI. THC is well-known for its medical uses, so if they're related to that, it could be a positive signal from the health sector.

Now, considering all these tweets, I notice several threads: Amex prime is looking for Amazon's services, increased interest in NASDAQ by multiple companies, strategic investments, and some tech-related companies. These all point towards potential growth in Amazon, both through innovation and expansion into new sectors. The positive mentions of various companies suggest broader market sentiment that supports the stock.

However, without specific data on how these tweets have affected previous prices or current news about Amazon, it's a bit challenging to be certain. But overall, the presence of positive strategies like cloud training, new products, and expanding into tech and health could indicate a positive trend. Therefore, putting this together, I would conclude that the stock is likely going to increase."
2015-05-17,Neutral,"Okay, so I'm looking at these tweets and trying to figure out how they might affect the stock price of the companies mentioned. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

First tweet is about amzn's URL inc, mentioning current price and a click link to a few stocks: amzn, cure, ewg, srne. The wording seems like it's giving information or suggesting that these are related, but I don't see any positive or negative indicators here. It's just general info on the company's URL.

Next tweet is about slb (Schlumberger) with a dividend click link. Again, this is providing general stock details without indicating sentiment towards the stock itself. So no positive or negative cues here either.

Third tweet talks about cabn (Carbon Sciences), mentioning their last price and listing stocks including nasdaq. This seems like they're just reporting current information, not expressing confidence or doubt about the stock performance.

Lastly, gdx is discussing market vectors with a focus on gold miners, stating that their changes could impact the stock. Here, it's talking about trends related to the company—gold mining—which could affect their financial performance. However, without specific news about the industry or any positive/neutral indicators in these tweets themselves, it's hard to say if this will have an impact.

Putting it all together, none of the tweets provide specific reasons for expecting positive, negative, or neutral sentiment towards each company. Each tweet is just giving information they don't necessarily express a clear opinion on stock performance. So overall, I think it's probably [Neutral]."
2015-05-18,Neutral,"Alright, I need to figure out how to determine the likely impact on Amazon's stock price based on these tweets. Let me start by going through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. The user mentioned 'amzn' multiple times, so that seems to be the target company.

Now, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. 

Looking at tweet 1: It's about making TV series for Amazon but mentioning an URL issue with Amazon. I'm not sure what this means in terms of sentiment. The user is frustrated about agreeing to work on a project together, which could be seen as criticism but maybe not strong enough to indicate a clear positive or negative opinion.

Tweet 2 talks about the company's performance in Q1 2016 and looking at earnings from 2015. This seems like they're evaluating past performance and future goals. Earnings history can influence investor sentiment, but unless there are any positive outcomes expected, this might not strongly impact stock price.

Tweet 3 mentions that Amazon is trending on their stock market with some specific stocks: amzn, cbi, abc, trq. This seems like a buzz about the company's performance and could indicate positive news. But without knowing more about what they're doing or the specifics of these trends, it's hard to assess sentiment.

Tweet 4 discusses the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) but again mentions specific stock symbols: ibb, gdx, snp. P/E ratios can affect valuations, so maybe this tweet is trying to set a benchmark for future investment or growth potential.

Putting it all together, the tweets are mostly focusing on current performance metrics and external factors related to Amazon's stock market position. They don't present significant positive information about products, earnings, or company strength. There's some buzz about trends but no clear indication of strong news that would tip the balance. Therefore, these tweets seem neutral in their impact."
2015-05-19,Missing,File not found
2015-05-20,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets and figure out how they impact the stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

Starting with the first tweet: ""amzn URL inc . news click here -> URL trending $ amzn $ oih $ gdx $ pcln amzn investing investing."" The user is providing information about Amazon's (AMZN) URL and related products. This seems like they're spreading a link or information to their audience, which usually indicates positive attention towards the stock.

Next tweet: ""hd home depot , inc . current price click here -> URL trending $ hd $ wfc $ cldn $ amzn hd finance pennystocks."" Here, HD Home Depot is mentioned along with their stock price. They are providing financial information and looking for user engagement, which can show positive sentiment.

Third tweet: ""rt AT_USER stock $ ngcg on AT_USER muchomacho hempmelon hemp infused drink infuser URL via $ amzn $ ko URL."" The user is adding more links related to a product (Hemisphere Infused Drink) as a way to promote Amazon. This is a common tactic in social media that signals support for the company.

Similarly, the fourth and fifth tweets follow the same pattern—linking products as part of their strategy to boost Amazon's stock price. They're showing user engagement with their content.

The sixth tweet repeats this link without adding new info, just repeating the same content. While it's not a full link, it reinforces the idea that they are looking at Amazon.

Tweets 7-10 are more informational about Gold (GLO) and Valves (VLE), which don't seem to be related to AMZN. They might indicate investment sentiment but could be neutral or slightly negative if there's uncertainty about the market.

Finally, tweet 11 mentions that Microsoft is reducing their cloud costs by 34% due to a lawsuit, targeting Gold. This could signal either positive (cost reductions) or negative (legal issues) towards Amazon's stock.

Overall, multiple tweets are promoting Amazon through links and financial information, which suggests strong positive engagement. However, some tweets, like the legal one, could be neutral or slightly negative if the company is in a bad position."
2015-05-21,Negative,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. The user wants me to evaluate each tweet individually first, separate positive (P) and negative (N) factors, assess sentiment, and then combine them to give a final overall sentiment.

Looking at the first tweet: ""cown cowen group , inc . 52wk low click here -> URL trending $ cown $ fv $ amzn $ pbmd cown invest tradeideas."" This seems like it's about trends in company performance or stock prices. It mentions things like 52wk low, clicks on a URL, and mentions ""trending"" for Amazon. It doesn't look positive or negative; more of an informational tweet with potential link to the stock.

Second tweet: ""preapertura en-state unidos 21/05 / 2015 $ bby $ ocr $ nke $ baba URL $ wsm $ crm $ ntap $ amzn."" This seems like a news event on a specific date. It mentions states, companies (bby, ocr, nke, etc.), and links to AMZN's URL. Not sure about the positive or negative factors here—could be speculative but maybe neutral.

Third tweet: ""bosocial : bosocial : jotaibi 61 : $ lrcx put $ spy $ qqq $ aapl $ googl $ goog $ twtr $ fb $ baba $ pcln $ tsla $ bidu $ amzn $ msf … URL."" This is more of an unrelated tweet with links and numbers. It doesn't seem to relate to Amazon, so probably neutral or negative since it's not providing any relevant information on the stock.

Fourth tweet: ""$ amzn - why URL inc isn't scared of google inc's ' buy' button URL."" This seems like a warning or opinion about competitors. The user is questioning whether Apple will be scared of Google's ""buy"" button and is suggesting they might jump into it. This could be a negative sentiment as it expresses concern about competition.

Fifth tweet: ""$ amzn $ ebay news : ' alibaba shares are relatively cheap $ amzn $ ebay $ baba ' URL analyze : URL."" This seems like a news report on Alibaba's stock price relative to other companies. It mentions that Alibaba shares are relatively cheap compared to other competitors. This could be seen as a positive point because it suggests a potential opportunity or lower pricing, which might benefit Amazon.

Sixth tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ baba , $ yhoo , $ amzn , $ goog risks for alibaba , yahoo and internet stocks ? bernstein just laid them … URL ~ …"" This seems like a social media post from Twitter where users are sharing concerns about risks for other companies. It mentions that Bernstein has laid off some risks, which could indicate negative sentiment because it's worried about future developments or risks.

Seventh tweet: ""most media is duplicable — look at $ amzn . the literal billion dollar q is , how do you entice good developers to make apps for your platform?"" This seems like a question from Twitter. It's discussing whether the company can duplicate something valuable and making it more attractive to developers. It doesn't directly relate to Amazon, but could be viewed negatively if suggesting that Amazon might struggle with developing products.

Now, summarizing each tweet:

1. Not positive or negative.
2. Possible mixed sentiment, but not sure yet.
3. Neutral, no relevant info.
4. Negative because of concern about competition.
5. Positive because it mentions a potential opportunity despite Alibaba's shares being cheap.
6. Negative due to social media concerns from users worried about risks.
7. Neutral, no direct relation.

Combining all these, the positives are tweet 2 and tweet 5, negatives are 4, 6, and 7. However, without clear sentiment strength on tweets 2 and 6, but mostly leaning positive because of potential future opportunities.

Wait, but some might consider social media (tweets 2 and 6) as a broader trend or news. So perhaps tweet 5 is the main positive with tweet 4 negative. Tweet 6 could be more than just social media; it's about risks and potential competition. Maybe not so strong sentiment there.

Overall, considering all tweets, the overall sentiment seems to be mixed, but leaning towards positive because of potential opportunities from tweets 2 and 5, while acknowledging some concerns in 4 and 7."
2015-05-22,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions the NASDAQ 100 and talks about AMZN shorting for a gain in seven days. Shorting can sometimes indicate confidence in the stock, which might lead investors to buy more. However, it doesn't explicitly state whether it's positive or negative without more context.

2. The second tweet is linked via Twitter handlebosocial, but I don't have enough information here. It talks about various stocks like Aapl, Baba, Amzn, etc., and mentions the CBOE future. This seems like a lot of technical terms that could affect stock prices based on market conditions. Without sentiment data from this tweet alone, it's hard to assess.

3. The third tweet also usesbosocial but lists more specific names: SDRL, Chk news, which might be related to financial news. It mentions BABA and AMZN again. Similar to the second tweet, this seems like speculative trading without explicit sentiment data from the tweet itself.

4. The fourth tweet is about RT AT_USER responding to Alibaba's comeback on May 21st, 2015. The address includes URLs related to BABA and GOOG (Google). The mention of a company turnover doesn't directly relate to stock performance but could affect investor sentiment based on the market dynamics around that time.

Putting it all together, none of these tweets provide explicit information about AMZN's earnings, news, or any other significant events. They mostly talk about shorting strategies and speculative trading, which typically indicate uncertainty rather than a clear positive or negative trend. Therefore, the impact seems neutral."
2015-05-23,Positive,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet mentions that Amazon is launching an Etsy killer for $59. That sounds like a new product launch, which usually increases investor interest and boosts sales. I think this is positive.

2. The second tweet talks about Amazon starting to pay taxes on British corporation retail sales in the UK. This could affect their taxable income, potentially impacting their profitability and stock price. Also, it's a news event; might be a bit of both positive and neutral.

3. Third tweet provides a summary of LCI's earnings. If LCI has good earnings, it could improve Amazon's financials, which is a good sign for the stock. So positive sentiment here too.

4. Fourth tweet discusses Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) shares. While JNJ is a big company, their performance isn't necessarily related to Amazon. Maybe some correlation but not sure. Maybe neutral because of unknown factors.

5. Fifth tweet mentions Pioneer Natural Resources last trade and their stock performance over 3300% in 7 months. That's a massive jump, suggesting good market sentiment, probably positive.

6. Sixth tweet talks about a penny stock alert from $TLFX gaining 70% in the past week and a half. It's an alert, so maybe just a warning or update on price movement, not a strong statement. Maybe neutral because it's speculative but could be considered as such.

7. Seventh tweet suggests that their shares have gained over 3300% for subscribers in 7 months. Again, a big number but without context on why the subscriber would earn that much, it might just be speculation or a lucky case. Positive or neutral? Maybe positive because of potential good news, but uncertain.

8. Eighth tweet talks about TFX (TLX) shares gaining 70% in the past week and a half. Similar to tweet 6, another stock alert with speculative aspects. Could be considered negative if investors are worried about something bad, but maybe neutral since it's just a share price update.

9. Ninth tweet discussespiring for imports from pir/pizzaHub in GA. This could affect Amazon's supply chain or pricing strategy, which might influence the stock. Possible positive impact because good suppliers can help with production costs and supply chain reliability.

10. Tenth tweet mentions RPCR shares on the penny stock exchange at a day low of $RPCR. Day lows are speculative; they don't necessarily indicate future performance. Could be considered negative if investors are worried about poor performance, but maybe neutral since it's just a price level change.

11. Eleventh tweet talks about Proshares Ultra VIX futures for Amazon stock over the next 3 months. The VIX index measures market volatility and investor fear. If there's positive news affecting the VIX (which affects stock prices), this could be negative because investors are scared of rising volatility. But if the VIX is expected to improve, it might be positive.

12. Twelfth tweet targets the "" handmade "" marketplace for Amazon. This seems unrelated unless they're emphasizing a new product line. It's speculative but no real impact on Amazon's main operations, so probably neutral.

Putting this all together: The tweets seem to have some strong positives like new products, big earnings reports, favorable news about supply chain, and potential future volatility from the VIX. However, there are also some negative tweets about other unrelated companies or speculative alerts that might not significantly impact Amazon's stock price. The overall sentiment seems mixed but leans towards positive due to the potential for market trends and product launches."
2015-05-24,Neutral,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user provided three tweets and wants me to determine their likely impact on the stock price using positive, neutral, or negative sentiments. Hmm.

First, I need to extract the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: $ ngcg new hemp infuse water @ amazon URL - URL via otc stock vets $ amzn. The stock symbol here is AMZN. Wait, that's Amazon. So all three tweets mention AMZN. That might be helpful.

Now, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. Let me go through them one by one.

1. "" $ ngcg new hemp infuse water @ amazon URL - URL via otc stock vets $ amzn"". The word ""vet"" is probably a typo or typo-stripped. So the main part here is mentioning the stock symbol, which doesn't directly impact the stock price much. It might be promoting something else, but I don't see any positive or negative factors here.

2. "" our penny stock pick on $ thcz is up 570.77 % for platinum members ! big update : URL $ amzn $ mcox $ goog"". This tweet mentions the company AMZN and talks about a penny stock pick. It's giving an update and mentions MCox and Goog. The use of ""up"" here could indicate that the stock is performing well. However, it doesn't explicitly state anything positive or negative regarding AMZN.

3. Similar to the second tweet, since both are promoting AMZN. They might be encouraging investors to buy the stock as a penny stock pick and provide an update on other companies. Again, this tweet isn't providing any explicit sentiment or information about AMZN's performance, price movements, or anything else.

Since all tweets mention AMZN but don't provide detailed analysis on its financial performance, trends, or sentiment towards its stock, it seems like there's no clear positive, negative, or neutral impact. The user is just highlighting the company and encouraging investment in it through promotions.

I think each tweet is more about promoting the stock rather than affecting its price. So the overall sentiment is neutral because they don't present any positive or negative information."
2015-05-25,Neutral,"Alright, so I have to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me see what each tweet says.

Starting with the first tweet: ""bmy bristol myers squibb co . ask size URL $ bmy $ am zn."" Hmm, this seems like a link or maybe part of a larger query. It mentions BMY, BRISTOL, MYERS, Squibb Co., and some stock symbols. I'm not sure what this tweet is about—it might be an inquiry rather than an impact statement.

Moving on to the second tweet: ""amzn URL inc . bid size URL $ am zn."" This looks like a stock name or possibly part of a search query. It mentions AMZN, URL, INC, and some stock symbols. Again, I'm confused about what this tweet is indicating—maybe it's just listing things without providing any meaningful information.

The third tweet: ""psec proshares ultra qqq fund market cap URL $ psec $ pdco $ baba $ am zn."" This one has ""PSEC,"" which might stand for a financial institution or another entity. It mentions ProShares, Ultra, QQQ, Fund, Market Cap, and stock symbols. This seems similar to the previous tweets in structure but not clear on what it's about. It could be an investment tip or something related to stock selection.

Since each tweet is providing information without directly influencing investor sentiment or predicting stock movements, I don't see any positive, negative, or neutral trends here. They might be informational pieces rather than statements suggesting buy, sell, or hold a stock."
2015-05-26,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets about a company's stock price impact. The user provided 10 tweets related to amzn.com, and my task is to determine if each one is positive, neutral, or negative on the overall outlook for the stock.

First, I should probably go through each tweet one by one. But wait, some of them don't have a stock symbol mentioned at the beginning. Hmm, let's look at each tweet:

1. ""opxa opexa therapeutics , inc . ex-div date URL $ opxa $ ewz $ amzn $ nrz opxa stocks nasdaq"" – This tweet just lists other companies related to Amazon (AMZN) as listed under stock symbols. No obvious positive or negative here.

2. ""cjt.to cargojet inc . shares URL $ cjt.to $ fxd $ lvs $ amzn cjt.to nasdaq stocks"" – Again, mentions AMZN without any sentiment indicators.

3. ""AT_USER $ amzn verizon and URL have this one thing in common URL"" – This seems to indicate a positive note, mentioning that VERizon is being mentioned with amzn, which might imply good news for Amazon, so I'll mark this as Positive.

4. ""ibm international business machines summary URL $ ibm $ amzn $ tna $ ibb ibm stock stocks"" – It mentions AMZN again without any positive or negative cues.

5. ""$ ngcg new hemp infuse water @ amazon URL - URL via otc stock vets $ amzn"" – The user is suggesting that this could be a negative news related to Amazon, but without clear sentiment like ""up"" or ""down,"" it's neutral.

6. ""rt AT_USER fdx federal national mortgage 52wk low URL $ fdx $ vod $ amzn $ gild fdx pennystocks stockmarket"" – This tweet is confusing due to the mention of FDX and GILD, which aren't relevant, so I can't tell much here. It might be neutral.

7. ""$ amzn still in a choppy channel . but back above the 8d . URL AT_USER"" – The user is saying Amazon isn't performing well (choppy channel) but is still on the up trend (above the 8th day), which could imply that while it's not great, there might be positive news coming up. This seems positive.

8. ""will $ amzn stock be affected byEurope tax practices change ? URL"" – The user is asking about potential impact from changes in European tax laws on Amazon. Without specific data or analysis, it's speculative and could go either way, so neutral.

9. ""$ amzn still in a choppy channel . but back above the 8d . URL AT_USER"" – Similar to tweet 7, this again suggests that Amazon is doing well, implying positive sentiment.

10. ""rt AT_USER the alibaba comeback w / AT_USER | may 21st , 2015 | URL | $ baba $ amzn $ googl $ goog $ wba URL"" – This tweet seems to be from a competitor named Alibaba and mentions GOOG which is Alphabet Inc., suggesting a positive note. It's unclear if it affects Amazon, but as per the context, it might indicate positive news for all companies involved.

Now, compiling these thoughts: Tweets 3,7,9,10 seem to mention AMZN positively in some way, like product mentions or industry comparisons. However, tweets 5 and 6 are confusing and don't provide solid sentiment cues. So overall, the stock looks a bit positive, with several tweets supporting that."
2015-05-27,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative regarding the stock price of some company. The user has provided six tweets and wants me to analyze them step by step.

First, let's recall the process: I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Then, for each tweet, separate it into positive and negative factors. After that, assess the sentiment of each factor. Finally, combine these sentiments to determine the overall impact on the stock price.

Looking at the tweets:

1. The first tweet doesn't mention a specific company symbol. Hmm, this is confusing. I might have to skip this one since there's no target stock.

2. The second tweet mentions ""polgarstocks"" and other stocks like Apple Inc., Google, Amazon. It talks about their performance in finance or reading about them. This could be positive because it's discussing the company and its performance metrics.

3. The third tweet is URLs but mentions AMZN, mentioning things like business infrastructure solutions. Positive because it's talking about the company's strategy and investment in technology.

4. Fourth tweet: BP and Amoco are companies, I believe. It talks about their messages on Twitter. Maybe positive if they're communicating positively, but could also be neutral or even negative depending on context.

5. Fifth tweet mentions VZ (Vanguard Total Share Price), Insy, kindfinance, stocks trading in money/Trading. Positive because it's talking about the stock and its activity in the market.

6. Sixth tweet lists ""early movers"" with various companies: TIF, KORSO, Tol, etc. It suggests that these are among the first to go public or expand their operations, which could be positive for investors as it implies good growth prospects.

Now, let's assign each tweet to a company. But some tweets don't specify the stock symbol, so I'll have to make educated guesses. For example, ""polgarstocks"" and ""tif , $ kors , $ tol , $ bws"" could be TIF, KORSO, or TOLO.

Assuming the companies are positive-looking, the sentiment would lean towards positive since they're talking about growth and potential expansion. However, without specific info on their financials, it's hard to be certain. But given that some tweets do mention stock performance or company strategies, this could be a mix of positive and neutral.

So combining all these thoughts, the first tweet is incomplete. Then the second is positive about companies, third also positive with investments in tech. The fourth is mixed but could be neutral. Fifth is definitely positive. Sixth suggests growth, which can be positive. So overall sentiment seems positive because most are supportive of growth or expansion.

But wait, I'm not sure if ""polgarstocks"" refers to a specific company. Maybe it's a typo for something else. Also, the sixth tweet doesn't specify the stock, so it's ambiguous but still leaning towards positive."
2015-05-28,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the target stock is Amazon (AMZN). Now, looking at each tweet:

1. The first tweet mentions efa and others, which don't directly relate to AMZN.
2. The second tweet talks about Facebook (FB), not AMZN either.
3. Third tweet discusses Amazon's free shipping for Prime members but also mentions Wal-Mart, which is unrelated.
4. Fourth tweet says AMZN offers free delivery to prime members without mentioning AMZN itself or the stock price impact.
5. Fifth tweet focuses on the S&P 500 (SPY) and VIX index, but again, not related to AMZN.
6. Sixth tweet mentions Nokta (NOK), which is unrelated to AMZN either.
7. Seventh tweet involves market vectors and gold miners asking about Amazon shares.
8. Eighth tweet details a deal between JBLU entering into an agreement with Inc., again unrelated.
9. Ninth tweet by Amazon aims for fast, free delivery but doesn't mention the stock price or impact on it.
10. Tenth tweet is similar to the ninth.

All tweets don't provide any direct information about AMZN's stock performance, profitability, or anything related. They talk about other companies and financial indices without influencing AMZN. There's no positive, negative, or neutral sentiment expressed here. So, overall, there seems to be no significant impact on Amazon's stock price."
2015-05-29,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's future stock price. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, looking at tweet 1: ""Our pick on $vgtl closed up 28.57% yesterday & saw it's highest volume in 10 years ! big news : URL $amzn $qcom $csco."" So Amazon is mentioned a lot here. The closing percentage being so high suggests some positive news. They're highlighting the stock's performance and mentioning other companies, which might indicate that investors are looking at Amazon's performance. This could boost Amazon's stock.

Next, tweet 2: ""ahs amn healthcare services , inc . shares URL $ahs $amzn $pbmd $ddd ahs stocks stockmarket."" Here, they're talking about a company called AHS, which is linked to Amzn. But I'm not sure how relevant this is unless it's related to Amazon. Maybe it's just another company in the tech space. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if this tweet has a positive or negative impact.

So, considering both tweets, tweet 1 seems more definitive and possibly positive since it mentions a significant drop in volume. It also highlights other companies, which might be indicating interest from investors. Tweet 2 is less clear but could be related or not. Given that, I think the overall sentiment is positive for Amazon's stock."
2015-05-30,Negative,"Alright, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of GCP. Let me break it down step by step.

First, identifying the target stock symbol from the tweets is tricky here because they don't specify which company. However, looking at the second tweet mentions ""cm.to"" and other companies like Centerpoint Energy and Short Sales Investments. Maybe these are related to the broader financial sector, so GCP could be a tech or renewable energy company.

Next, analyzing each tweet for Positive (P) or Negative (N) factors. The first tweet talks about building an ecosystem as strong as Apple's but with a URL link that seems like a placeholder. It might not have specific positive or negative info on the stock itself.

The second tweet is about investing in companies listed at $ cm.to, eca.to, rdsh, etc., and mentions short sales. This could relate to investment sentiment towards specific sectors or companies, but it's unclear how that affects GCP directly unless there are overlapping companies.

I'm not seeing any explicit information linking these tweets to GCP. Both tweets seem out of context for the stock I'm analyzing. There's no mention of positive news about GCP or any significant events related to them. So, without specific data on GCP's performance, market reactions, or other indicators like earnings or fundamentals, it's hard to assess sentiment.

Therefore, based solely on what's provided, neither tweet contributes meaningful information about the stock price. The overall sentiment remains neutral."
2015-05-31,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. I'll go through each tweet one by one and assess their potential effects.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the tweets provided:

1. amzn URL inc . change URL $ amzn $ gdx $ gme $ mdy amzn pennystocks pennystocks
2. amzn URL inc . current price URL $ amzn $ gdxj $ brwc $ ewa amzn stockmarket stocks
3. $ ngcg new hemp infuse water @ amazon URL - URL via otc stock vets $ amzn
4. amzn URL inc . ask URL $ amzn $ ges $ afop $ gyld amzn tradeideas nasdaq

10. $ ngcg new hemp infuse water @ amazon URL - URL via otc stock vets $ amzn
11. tlt ishares barclays 20 + year treasury bond fund volume URL $ tlt $ gbgm $ cjtf $ amzn tlt investing stock

From these, the target stock symbol seems to be ""amzn"". The rest of each line mentions other companies or similar terms but doesn't focus on Amazon. 

Now, I'll process each tweet for factors and sentiment.

1. ""am zn URL inc . change URL $ amzn $ gdx $ gme $ mdy amzn pennystocks pennystocks""
- This seems like a typo in the URL, possibly a typo or irrelevant text.
- No direct information about Amazon's stock performance; likely neutral.

2. ""am zn URL inc . current price URL $ amzn $ gdxj $ brwc $ ewa amzn stockmarket stocks""
- Again, mentions other companies and stock symbols but nothing specific to Amazon's performance. Neutral.

3. ""$ ngcg new hemp infuse water @ amazon URL - URL via otc stock vets amzn""
- This line is part of a tweet related to Amazon but doesn't provide any info on Amazon's price or trends. It just mentions the product and market, so neutral.

4. ""am zn url inc . ask url $ amzn $ ges $ afop $ gyld amzn trade ideas nasdaq""
- Again, discussing other companies and stock symbols, not about Amazon. Neutral.

5. ""ttwo take-two interactive software , inc . stock message board URL $ ttwo $ amzn $ xle $ bep / un.to ttwo share …""
- This is about a tweet related to Amazon but mentioning a company (ttw) and other unrelated info. No direct impact on Amazon's price. Neutral.

6. ""rt rt rt rt 3 tech inspired etfs to ride nasdaq bull $ oneq $ qqq $ qqew also $ aapl $ msft $ googl $ amzn $ altr $ nfl … url""
- This is talking about ETFs related to the NASDAQ, which might indicate investor sentiment. Maybe some positive or negative? It's more about general market movements rather than Amazon specifically. Neutral.

7. ""rt rt plug plug power , inc . exchange url $ plug $ amzn $ googl $ iyr plug nasdaq stock …""
- Again, discussing a company (plug) and other unrelated terms. No info on Amazon. Neutral.

8. ""rt at_user 10 things to never buy at target url via at_user tgt wmt amzn""
- Discusses buying advice but no mention of Amazon's performance or trends. Neutral.

9. ""gopro's strategic pivot will translate to continued strong sales growth url $ amzn goog googl gpro""
- This tweet mentions a company (GPRO) and its potential impact on Amazon's sales. It suggests that if GPRO improves, Amazon might do well. This is positive for Amazon's stock price. So this seems like a Positive factor.

10. ""ngcg new hemp infuse water @ amazon url - URL via otc stock vets amzn""
- Again, part of the tweet about products but not directly about Amazon. Neutral.

11. ""tlt ishares barclays 20 + year treasury bond fund volume url $ tlt gbgm cjtf amzn tlt investing stock""
- Discusses a financial product (TTL) and its investment focus on Amazon. Maybe indicating a positive outlook? It's about investing, so not directly affecting the stock price. Neutral.

Now, compiling the factors:

- Positive: 9th tweet suggests GPRO could boost sales for Amazon.
- The rest are either irrelevant or neutral.

So overall sentiment is Positive because of the potential boost from GPRO."
2015-06-01,Neutral,"Alright, let's break down how I would approach analyzing these tweets to determine their impact on Amazon's stock price.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking through the tweets, it seems like ""amzn"" is the most prominent stock, so I'll focus on those related to Amazon or parts of companies connected to Amazon.

Now, for each tweet, I should separate them into positive and negative factors. For example, in tweet 1, there's a mention of an URL (URL) that might relate to stock data or news about Amazon. I'm not sure how specific this is, so maybe I'll note it as neutral or positive if the URL gives good information.

Next, I need to assess the sentiment of each tweet. This means understanding what's being communicated and whether it's encouraging growth (positive), discouraging growth (negative), or neither. For instance, in tweet 2, it talks about the market getting ""nasty"" and expecting a crack stock. That sounds negative because it's predicting something bad.

I also have to consider other factors from each tweet that might influence investor sentiment. These could include company performance metrics like stock prices or company earnings, technical analysis indicators (like moving averages), or news events affecting the stock.

Looking at the tweets:
1. The URL suggests some data about Amazon.
2. Talks about market resistance and expects a crack stock—this seems negative.
3. A small increase in stock but mentions other companies; this is mixed, but not too strong.
4. Talks about Google's entry into toys, which could be positive or neutral depending on context.
5. Discusses Broadcom stocks but no immediate action or data.
6. Questions why Google would want to enter toys, which might not impact Amazon directly.
7. Again mentions URLs and stock market info; not enough info yet.
8. Talks about gold miners, not directly related.

I also need to consider other external factors like the current economic environment, global events affecting tech companies, or news sentiment. However, without specific context, it's challenging, so I'll focus on the provided data.

Now, combining these elements:
- Positive tweets: Teks 3 and 8 might indicate good news from URLs.
- Negative tweets: Teks 2, 6 are clearly negative because they mention predicting something bad or negative events.

The overall sentiment is mixed. Some positive factors and a couple of negative ones. But given the context of just these tweets, it's hard to say definitively whether the stock is going up or down. It might be a neutral stance if neither dominates.

I'll go with ""Neutral"" because while there are mixed signals, they're not overwhelmingly positive or negative without more context."
2015-06-02,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets and figure out their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First tweet is about an URL post mentioning amzn, uup, cos.to, and eem. That seems like a technical analysis message or maybe a news article. It doesn't specify positive or negative; it's just a general statement.

Second tweet talks about tlt (Treasury Note), vjet (Vestibular Jeopardy), amZN (Amazon), nflx (Next Generics). This is also a broad topic, possibly related to the stock but without sentiment indicators. It doesn't seem positive or negative on its own.

Third tweet mentions gild (Gild brand, I think that's Gold segment, maybe part of energy or real estate?), lead scientists, ideas about amzn, and nasdaq. That sounds like it could be speculative optimism or a call for investment. Again, not specific to positive or negative sentiment.

Putting all these together, the tweets are either general announcements (no emotion), broad topics without specifics, or speculative in nature but not strong enough to indicate positive or negative impact on Amazon's stock."
2015-06-03,Neutral,"Okay, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of a company. The target stock symbol isn't directly provided here, but I can work with what's given.

First, looking at the first tweet: ""fxe currency shares euro trust p / e ratio URL $ fxe $ dwti $ act $ amzn fxe nasdaq invest"". Hmm, this seems like a link to some financial data or analysis about FFXE. The presence of keywords like P/E ratio and investing might indicate that someone is suggesting it's undervalued or perhaps making a call on the stock price.

The second tweet is a bit confusing: ""AT_USER your tweet about $ amzn had a sentiment of 1 and was featured on market parse . URL"". This one seems to be an attempt at spamming, mentioning the AMZN stock. The mention of sentiment of 1 might imply positive sentiment from the user, but since it's not directly linked to any data or analysis related to the target stock, I'm not sure if this tweet has a significant impact.

Now, considering Twitter's API response, ""featured on market parse"" suggests that this tweet was identified as relevant and is being processed. The sentiment here could be positive because of the ""+1"", but again, without specific data or context, it's hard to tell if it affects the stock price.

Putting it all together, the first tweet seems like it's providing some financial information, possibly indicating a trend or analysis that might influence investor behavior towards the target stock. The second tweet is more about spam and user sentiment, which doesn't seem to have much direct impact on the stock price either.

So, considering both tweets, especially the first one mentioning FFXE, I think there's some positive information being provided, but without knowing exactly what it says, it's a bit hard to weigh the overall impact. Maybe it's neutral because while there are data points, they might not directly translate to a positive or negative effect on the stock price as of now."
2015-06-04,Positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of AmZN. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. The user provided three tweets and one example. Looking at them:

1. ""rt rt gmcr keurig green mountain , inc . yield URL $ gmcr $ aal $ googl $ amzn gmcr finance sha … URL""
   - Not immediately clear if it's GMCR or another stock. Maybe gmcr is GMCM or something, but that might be irrelevant.

2. ""drank noho , inc . news URL $ drnk $ v $ c $ amzn drnk pennystocks finance""
   - Drank seems familiar; I think Drank is a real company. So the symbol here is DRK.

3. ""$ amzn - is wal-mart inc . stock a buy ? URL""
   - Wal-Mart shares are typically low, but they can go up if consumer confidence increases. This tweet suggests a positive outlook, so it's likely GMCN.

4. ""jnug direxion daily junior gold miners index bull 3x shares filings URL $ jnug $ kite $ rsp $ amzn jnug invest nasdaq""
   - JNUG is associated with Directrix. The mention of junior gold miners and an upward trend suggests a positive direction for the company, so AMZN.

So the targets are GMCR, DRK, GMCN, and AMZN. I'll need to analyze each tweet's sentiment towards these stocks.

Looking at GMCR: The user doesn't provide specific info, but if it's related to GMCM or something else that could affect GMCR, like a product launch or earnings. However, the tweets don't mention anything significant about GMCR except maybe a ""gmcr"" keyword elsewhere in the first tweet, which might suggest it's GMCM.

GMCN is about Wal-Mart, but I know they've been profitable in recent years because of their strong demand for groceries and convenience goods. So positive for AMZN.

DRK: Drank is known to be a strong consumer stocks, so if there's talk of high consumer confidence, that would boost the stock positively.

AMZN specifically mentions JNUG as a company to invest in, with an upward trend. So this tweet suggests a positive outlook on AMZN, which is good for investors.

Now, combining all these: GMCR could have mixed signals, but given GMCM's history and maybe some tech-related info elsewhere, it might still be positive. DRK being strong consumer stocks would add to the positive. GMCN as an established company is generally stable or growth potential, so that adds support. JNUG's investment suggestion with upward trends also boosts sentiment.

Overall, all these factors point towards a positive impact on AMZN's stock price."
2015-06-05,Missing,File not found
2015-06-06,Neutral,"Alright, I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for the given company. Let me start by breaking down the problem step by step.

First, from each tweet, I should extract the target stock symbol. Looking at the first tweet: ""rt rt rt rt rt helpful video for stock options beginners ! ! URL $ goog $ aapl $ googl $ amzn $ fb $ … URL"". The numbers and exclamation marks seem to be part of URLs or identifiers. The relevant stock symbols here are 'goog' (Google), 'aapl' (Apple), 'amzn' (Amazon), and 'fb' ( Facebook). So, the target stocks are Google, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook.

Next, for each tweet, I need to identify Positive and Negative factors. But wait, all these tweets don't seem to have any explicit information about the company's performance or positive/negative news related to the stock. They're just URLs with 'helpful video' and exclamation marks. Hmm, that might be a problem because without context like financial updates or news articles, it's hard to assess the sentiment.

I should also consider whether these tweets are replies from other users or if they're part of a specific community. Without more context, I can't extract meaningful factors. Since all tweets are about helpful content and general internet discussions, they don't provide any quantitative data that would indicate positive or negative trends in stock prices.

Given this uncertainty, maybe the sentiment is considered neutral because there's no clear indication of how these tweets will affect the stock price. Investors often react neutrally when external information isn't available unless it provides positive or negative insights into specific factors like earnings, industry performance, etc., which are not present here.

So, considering all that, I'll conclude the overall sentiment as Neutral because there's insufficient information to determine a clear direction on how these tweets will impact the stock price."
2015-06-07,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their likely impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by breaking down each tweet one by one.

First tweet: "" $ amzn jeffbezos - next big thing ? ? ? URL"" – Hmm, this looks like a typo. It seems to mention Jeff Bezos but the rest is unclear. Maybe it's about his role or something related? Not sure yet, might be too vague.

Second tweet: ""altr altera corp . stock forum URL $ altr $ tna $ trv $ amzn altr invest finance"" – This mentions Altera Corporation and their stock on a forum. The mention of investing in finance could indicate interest or discussion about the company's financials, which might affect investor sentiment positively.

Third tweet: ""slb schlumberger ltd . quotes URL $ slb $ am zn $ swks $ csco slb stockmarket nasdaqslv ishares silver trust investor …"" – Here, there are multiple companies listed, including Schluber Solutions and Silver Trust. The silver ETF might be a financial tool or investment opportunity. This could impact the stock price positively by attracting investors.

Fourth tweet: ""slb schlumberger ltd . quotes URL $ slb $ am zn $ swks $ csco slb stockmarket nasdaqslv ishares silver trust investor …"" – Similar to the third tweet, mentions Schluber Solutions and Silver Trust. The same ETF as before might boost Amazon's stock price.

Fifth tweet: ""rt rt helpful video for stock options beginners ! ! URL $ goog $ aapl $ googl $ am zn $ fb $ feye $ fxc … URL"" – This is a call to action for someone who's new to stock options. It could be encouraging investors but might not directly relate to Amazon unless there's a correlation, which isn't clear.

Now, evaluating each tweet:
1. The first tweet seems out of place and unclear.
2. Positive factors: Alternatives and investing in finance.
3. Positive factors: Schluber Solutions and Silver Trust ETFs.
4. Similar positive factors as tweet 3.
5. A call to action without specific financial content.

Considering the overall sentiment, multiple tweets mention investing in financial companies and a helpful video for stock options. These could indicate that Amazon is being viewed positively by investors due to potential investment opportunities or by encouraging others to engage with their finance strategies. However, the lack of clear financial info makes it uncertain if this directly affects Amazon's price.

I think there's some positive sentiment but not enough specific data to make a definitive conclusion. It might be considered [Neutral] because while there are positive influences on investor interest and discussions about the ETFs, the direct impact on Amazon's stock isn't clear from these tweets alone."
2015-06-08,Negative,"Alright, let me figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a given company. The user provided specific steps to follow, so I need to make sure I cover each part carefully.

First, I need to identify the target stock by extracting its symbol from the tweets. But looking at the tweets, none seem to mention a specific stock. Hmm, maybe it's implied or there's something else I'm missing. Since the user hasn't provided a target stock in the tweets, perhaps this isn't necessary for the analysis unless one of them refers to a known company.

Next, each tweet needs to be broken down into positive and negative factors. I'll go through each tweet one by one.

1. ""rt AT_USER the 10 things in advertising you need to know today $ fb $ amzn $ ua URL"" – This seems like a call to action for investors. The keywords here are ""the 10 things in advertising,"" which suggests that amzn might be a competitor or target of a campaign.

2. ""bib proshares ultra nasdaq biotechnology investor opinions URL $ bib $ amzn $ hack $ qld bib nasdaq pennystocks"" – This looks like a tweet promoting Nasdaq and biotechnology companies, so it's positive for investors who care about those sectors.

3. ""wmt wal-mart stores , inc . 52wk low URL $ wmt $ amzn $ tr $ auy wmt nasdaq stock"" – This seems to be talking about Wall-Marts' financials over the next 52 weeks. Lower stock price might indicate concerns, so this could be negative for investors expecting positive growth.

4. ""rt rt rt rt rt $ msft 120 mints $ spy $ qqq $ aapl $ googl $ goog $ twtr $ fb $ baba $ pcln $ tsla $ bidu $ amzn $ msft $ ddd … … URL"" – This is multiple mentions of MSFT, which could indicate that the user is promoting or analyzing the stock. The repeated ""msft"" might suggest a focus on MSFT performance.

5. ""rt AT_USER this is alibaba's biggest push yet to take on amazon in the cloud : URL $ baba $ amzn URL"" – This tweet seems positive for AMZN, as it's highlighting a strategic move by Alibaba to compete with Amazon online services. Cloud technology might be an indicator of future growth.

6. ""$ c news : "" 5 stocks we hate too much $ amzn $ c $ gm $ tsla $ unh "" URL analyze : URL"" – This seems like negative analysis about AMZN, indicating investor sentiment is down. The mention of AMZN being hated by some could imply a downward trend.

7. ""is microsoft azure a threat to URL inc . web services ? $ amzn URL"" – Again, this tweet is promoting MSFT and Azure, which are tech companies. Lower stock price might mean investors are concerned about these technologies not serving the business's core needs.

8. ""$ amzn : URL inc . ( amzn ): fire tv is a success amongst americans : URL"" – This seems to be a statement about the success of Fire TV in America and mentions AMZN, which could indicate growth or positive outlook for AMZN.

Now, compiling these thoughts: Positive tweets focus on competitors like Biotech, Cloud tech companies, and Fire TV. Negative tweets mention concerns, lower stock prices, and predictions of decreased investor sentiment towards AMZN. There are also mentions of Microsoft's Azure product being a threat to some other company.

The overall sentiment would be a mix—some positive for future growth but others negative due to decreasing investor confidence. So the conclusion should reflect that while there are favorable investments, the overall market might remain neutral."
2015-06-09,Positive,"Alright, I'm looking at all these tweets and trying to figure out how they affect the stock price of Amazon. Let me break it down step by step.

First, each tweet is a candidate for positive or negative impact on Amazon's stock price. I need to analyze each one individually before deciding the overall sentiment.

Starting with the first tweet: ""Our stock alerts gained over 1300 % in less than 3 months ! see our new picks : URL $ orcl $ yhoo $ amzn $ amzn."" This seems positive because it mentions an increase and gives specific stocks. The user is offering investments, which could imply investor interest.

The second tweet: ""AT_USER $ amzn your tweet has been featured on market parse , for iphone . URL"" It just links Amazon to the user's tweet being featured elsewhere but doesn't clearly state a positive or negative sentiment. There's some mention of Apple and their stock, so maybe investors are aware of something.

Third tweet: ""ecig electronic cigarettes intl group , ltd . p / e ratio URL $ ecig $ amzn $ rxii $ dgaz ecig stocks tradeideas."" This seems neutral because it's talking about a company, mentioning their EPI ratio. It might not have strong positive or negative implications on Amazon directly.

Fourth tweet: ""amazon builds fourth fulfillment center in north texas | nbc 5 dallas-fort Worth URL via AT_USER $ amzn."" This is purely speculative and promotional without any positive or negative language. It's more about product development than stock performance.

Fifth tweet: ""nke nike inc . ideas URL $ nke $ ea $ amzn $ upro nke stockmarket pennystocks."" Again, this seems like a call to action or investment offer. The user is mentioning the company and products they're interested in, which could attract more investors.

Sixth tweet: ""$ us oil fund , lp chart URL $ uso $ amzn $ tvix $ uso usage investing."" This is about another financial ETF related to Amazon, but it's not indicating a positive or negative trend. It just links the stock with other investments.

Seventh tweet: ""$ ap aapl 127 @ 0.90 cents $ spy $ qqq $ aapl $ googl $ goog $ twtr $ fb $ baba $ pcln $ tsla $ bidu $ amzn $ msft $ ddd URL."" Positive because it gives specific stock info and mentions multiple tech companies, which could indicate investor interest.

Eighth tweet: ""$ amzn to 390 area unfilled gap , initial tgt 411 50ma from 421."" This is talking about the company's position in terms of future expansion or market potential. It might suggest growth but doesn't provide clear positive or negative information.

Ninth tweet: ""$ ap aapl 127 @ 0.90 cents $ inc . open URL $ amzn $ cnc $ ziop $ cat amzn investing tradeideas."" Positive because it offers investments and mentions several tech stocks, which could attract investors looking for opportunities.

Tenth tweet: ""$ baba nice closing . but not to break 88 $ $ spy $ qqq $ aapl $ googl $ goog $ twtr $ fb $ baba $ pcln $ tsla $ bidu $ amzn $ msft URL."" Positive because it's an update on BABA stock, which could be seen as positive news.

Eleventh tweet: ""$ eu's oettinger wants digital union to fend off us internet giants $ amzn URL URL"" This is speculative and might not have a clear impact. It's talking about a political move affecting Amazon but without specifics on the outcome, it's ambiguous.

Now, looking at all these tweets, most of them are promoting Amazon through investments, calls to action, or company announcements. They don't seem to be negative enough to outweigh positive ones. However, some mention EPI ratios (like third tweet) and areas unfilled gaps (eighth), but those are more about company performance than stock price.

I think overall sentiment is positive because many tweets are offering investments and promoting the company's growth. But there's a mix of speculative calls and specific mentions that could be seen as cautious, though not necessarily negative."
2015-06-10,Positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the future stock price of a company based on the given information. Let me start by understanding what's provided.

First, each tweet is about $NMXS, which I believe stands for Nexon stock or something similar. The user wants me to analyze each tweet and see how they might affect the stock. The possible outcomes are positive, neutral, or negative impact on the stock price.

Looking at the tweets one by one:

1. ""keep your eye on $ nmxs . something is up here . stocks $ amzn jimcramer currencytrader"" – This seems to be a general outlook for NEXON. The user mentions it's up and suggests they watch, which might indicate optimism or cautiousness.

2. ""the run is just beginning on $ nmxs . . 03 cents to . 10 should be no problem for this bull move ."" – This tweet seems to confirm the initial outlook from the first one. It's about the price moving up by 3 cents, which could mean that the stock is increasing in value.

3. ""$ ppch is one of the fastest moving penny stocks this month , so far ! special update : URL $ orcl $ yhoo $ amzn"" – This seems to be a sign that NEXON is among the faster-moving stocks. It might indicate that there's positive news related to it, which could boost investor confidence.

4. ""keep your eye on $ nmxs . something is up here . stocks $ amzn jimcramer currencytrader URL"" – Similar to the first tweet, it's an outlook and mentions AMZN (Amazon) for comparison. This could suggest that both companies are performing well, but since only NEXON is mentioned here, it might not be as conclusive.

5. ""$ amzn last week broke 438 . now this time breaks 438 and to the moon we get 452-458 long since yesterday ."" – This tweet is about the price of AMZN breaking a previous high at $438, which could be a bullish indicator for NEXON if there's a correlation. However, it seems a bit over-the-top with specific numbers and time frames.

6. ""rt AT_USER mpc marathon petroleum corp . shares URL $ mpc $ amzn $ drn $ rsx mpc pennystocks tradeideas"" – This tweet mentions MPCC (probably MPC) stock as related to AMZN. It's speculative, but if there's a connection between NEXON and MPCC, it might impact the price.

7. ""our stock pick on $ ppch has gained over 122 % in the past 2 weeks ! major news : URL $ amzn $ mcox $ goog"" – This tweet highlights that NEXON's stock performance is strong, which could be a positive factor for its future price.

8. ""cop conocophillips ideas URL $ cop $ kmx $ amzn $ dis cop investing pennystocks"" – Similar to the previous one, this seems to mention cop (probably Cop) and KMX (Kron) stocks related to AMZN. Again, it's speculative but might not directly impact NEXON.

Now, considering each tweet individually:

- The first two tweets are very general and confirm that AMZN is up by 3 cents.
- The third tweet brings in more info about NEXON being a fast-moving stock, which could be positive.
- The fourth tweet repeats the outlook for AMZN but doesn't mention NEXON specifically.
- The fifth tweet talks about AMZN breaking previous highs, which might not directly affect NEXON unless there's a correlation.
- The sixth and seventh tweets are speculative and don't seem to relate to NEXON.
- The eighth tweet is also speculative.

Combining these, the most positive tweet is number three where it mentions that NEXON has been moving quickly. This could indicate that there's significant news about NEXON, which might push its price up. However, without more context, it's hard to be certain, but it suggests that investors are watching NEXON closely.

The other tweets don't seem to provide strong enough information to outweigh the positive sign from tweet three. Therefore, I think the overall sentiment is positive."
2015-06-11,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. So, I have 10 tweets here, and each one seems to be talking about various aspects related to Amazon. 

First, I need to identify the target stock, which is AMZN. Now, looking at each tweet, some are URLs or mentioning specific companies that aren't relevant except for those related to AMZN. For example, Twitter accounts, financial terms like ""cln"" might refer to a company, but without more context, it's hard to tell. 

For each tweet, I should separate the positive and negative factors. Maybe each tweet can be categorized as either positive or negative based on the information provided. Then, assess the sentiment towards AMZN from these factors. Finally, combine all that to see if there's a net effect.

But wait, some tweets are just URLs with mentions of other companies, which might not directly affect AMZN. Others mention stock prices and trading ideas, which could indicate investor interest or expectations about Amazon. 

Looking at tweet 1: It seems like it's just an update without much info on AMZN. So probably neutral.

Tweet 2 is a bit confusing with ""mixed back"" but mentions $ amzn looks good. That makes me think positive because the stock is looking favorable.

Tweet 3 talks about patient home monitoring, financials, joy, and Amzn. It seems like mixed reviews, so maybe slightly negative.

Tweet 4 talks about probes and e-books, which might indicate some concerns about Amazon's revenue or business operations.

Tweet 5 mentions NFLX and APA, both of which are unrelated to AMZN unless there's a typo or misinterpretation. Maybe just a general mention.

Tweet 6 is about stock trades for $440 calls. It could be speculative but might suggest some interest in Amazon.

Tweet 7 talks about NMXS and something up, with money terms. Not sure what that relates to but maybe positive if the stock is doing well.

Tweet 8 discusses DWTI, WMIN, AMZN, SLTD, etc., which are all financials related to AMZN.

Tweet 9 mentions holdings in a company called WMHI, again unrelated unless it's a typo. They mention currency traders.

 Tweet 10 talks about AT_USER and something about middlefield's debate or other topics. Maybe just an opinion piece but not directly on AMZN.

Putting it all together: Some tweets suggest positive expectations for Amazon, especially tweet 2 and tweet 8. However, there are mixed and negative factors from other tweets like tweet 3 and tweet 5. The overall sentiment is leaning towards a balance because while there are some positive notes, the others show uncertainty or concerns.

I think it's neutral because although AMZN is looking good, the mixed and negative tweets add uncertainty, keeping the sentiment moderate."
2015-06-12,Positive,"Okay, I'm trying to analyze the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by going through each tweet and breaking them down.

Looking at the first few tweets, they all say ""rt AT_USER $ ngcg new hemp infuse water @ amazon URL - URL via otc stock vets $ amzn"" repeating multiple times. It sounds like a lot of people are following someone who's promoting the product and is updating their investment portfolio on Amazon. That's positive because more investors are following them, which might indicate they're interested in Amazon.

Then there are some tweets about penny stocks moving fast, but these ones are all about Amazon, so I don't think that's related. Next, a tweet from Amos Web Services announcing m4 instances for their EC2 URL. I'm not sure what that means, but it could be about hardware or infrastructure changes. It might affect how their stock is perceived.

Some tweets mention news updates like $ pcln and $ cmg for Amazon, which makes me think the company's stock is doing well. Others are about pharmaceuticals, with ""snss sunesis..."" So this tweet seems to have a mix of positive news from different companies.

Putting it all together: There are multiple mentions of following someone, positive investment activity from other companies, and some positive stock news. However, there are also a few unrelated tweets about moving penny stocks, which aren't directly related to Amazon.

I need to determine the overall sentiment. The fact that more people are following the user promoting Amazon and seeing stock updates suggests a positive trend. But some unrelated information might counterbalance it, but I don't think it's enough to make the overall impact negative or neutral. So I'm leaning towards a Positive sentiment."
2015-06-13,Missing,File not found
2015-06-14,Positive,"Alright, I'm looking at the user's query where they want me to analyze some tweets and determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative for a stock. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I need to figure out how to extract the stock symbol from each tweet. The tweets are in markdown format, so the first line seems like it's the stock ticker. Looking at the first tweet: ""rt stock_forums : amzn URL inc . ask size URL $ amzn $ lgcy $ xly $ ashr amz … URL"". Hmm, that doesn't look like a stock symbol. Maybe it's a list or something else. The second tweet is similar but uses ""mcox"" which I recognize as Meta Platforms Inc., also known as Facebook. So the target stock here is probably Meta (FBI? Or FB). 

Now, each tweet provides information about stock alerts or new picks. Let me go through them one by one.

First tweet: ""our stock alerts gained over 1300 % in less than 3 months ! see our new picks : URL $ amzn $ mcox $ google"". It mentions Meta increasing their stock performance and suggesting new picks, which implies positive information about the stock. This seems like a strong indicator of positive sentiment.

Second tweet: ""lexg lithium exploration group inc . open URL $ lexg $ amzn $ xnet $ ggal lexg stocks stockmarket"". Here, there's mention of a company called Lexg and their stock performance. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if this is positive or negative. It could be either, but given that the first tweet already suggests a positive outlook, maybe this tweet adds supporting info.

Third tweet: ""lexg lithium exploration group inc . open URL $ lexg $ amzn $ xnet $ ggal lexg stocks stockmarket"". Similar to the second one, it's just repeating information about another company. Again, not enough detail to determine sentiment.

Fourth tweet: ""rt AT_USER select growth stocks setting up or within buy range : $ cybr $ vdsi $ ilmn $ jd $ amzn $ cavm $ zbra $ calm $ gpro"". This seems like it's advising the user about selecting growth stocks that are within their buy range. This is generally positive because it provides a clear and actionable suggestion for investors.

Now, combining these thoughts: The first tweet gives a strong, immediate positive outlook on Meta's stock performance. The other tweets provide additional information but don't specify whether they're positive or negative. So overall, the strongest factor here is the first tweet about Meta increasing their stock performance by over 1300% in three months. This suggests good growth potential and therefore positive sentiment.

I should make sure that each tweet's factors are correctly evaluated. The first tweet has a clear, big move which usually signals positive news. The others might have mixed or neutral factors but don't outweigh the significant increase from Meta."
2015-06-15,Negative,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to determine the impact on the stock price of Amzn based on these tweets. 

First, I need to identify each tweet and extract the target stock symbol. From looking through them, it seems like Amzn is consistently mentioned. Let me go through each one step by step.

Looking at tweet 1, "" $ nmxs will be the talk of the town . Glad i found it before the herd . stocks $ amzn trader,"" I see a lot of uppercase letters and mentions of traders, but not sure if that affects Amzn directly. Then there are some URLs with other companies mentioned.

For each tweet, I need to split them into factors—positive and negative—and assess the sentiment on each. For example, in tweet 1, there's positive mentions like ""before the herd"" and ""glad,"" which might indicate good news for Amzn. But then there are also negative elements with quotes about traders, which could be misleading or just filler.

Moving on to tweet 2: It looks like a company info URL but includes some stock symbols, so maybe that's irrelevant unless it has positive/negative factors. It seems to link amzn to other companies and URLs, not directly related to Amzn.

Tweet 3 mentions ""low"" in several places, which might indicate a downward trend or lack of confidence, suggesting potential negative sentiment towards Amzn.

Tweet 4 talks about neurocrine biosciences and includes some stock symbols, but again, it's linked to amzn and other companies. It doesn't seem to have clear positive or negative factors on Amzn.

Tweet 5 is a repeat of tweet 4, so similar info as tweet 4.

Tweet 6 mentions ""egrwx"" which might be a typo for ""ebay,"" but again, not directly about Amzn. 

Tweet 7 talks about a video and includes amzn in the URL with some other companies. The mention of a stock forum link could indicate investor interest or thoughts on Amzn, possibly positive if they're active.

Tweet 8 mentions gains over eight months but doesn't provide specific info on Amzn's performance.

Tweet 9 links to hive aerohive networks and includes amzn in the URL. The mention of ""finance"" could imply a positive outlook, which might suggest good news for Amzn.

Tweet 10 talks about kmi stocks and mentions ""kinder morgan inc."" 

Tweet 11 discusses zfgn and mentions agnut.

Now, I need to assess each tweet's sentiment on Amzn. Tweets 1-3 are more about positive or neutral without clear factors. Tweet 7 has an open link but might indicate interest from investors. Tweet 9 suggests a positive stock forum, which could mean investor confidence. 

Tweets 4-6 and 8 don't have specific info on Amzn. Tweet 10 mentions kmi but doesn't specify their performance relative to Amzn. Tweet 11 is speculative but mentions investors.

Considering all these, the main positive tweets are tweet 7 suggesting interest in Amzn, and tweet 9 giving a forum about Amzn. However, there are also negative factors in some tweets, like ""low"" which might indicate uncertainty or down turns.

But overall, with several positive tweets pointing towards Amzn's stock positively, especially from tweet 7 and 9, it leans more positive than neutral."
2015-06-16,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out how the given tweets affect the stock price of a company, and then determine whether it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol. In the first tweet, they mention ""except for $ twtr $ baba $ amzn , most of stocks should be up or move sideways."" The words ""up"" and ""move sideways"" suggest that other stocks are expected to go up, which might mean the overall market is positive. But I'm not sure if that's specific enough.

Next, looking at tweet 2: ""am zn URL inc . summary url $ amzn $ pbr $ fnma $ dbc amzn nasdaq nasdaq."" The mention of AMZN and PBR suggests it's related to AMZN stock or its performance. Without more context, it's hard to tell if this is positive or negative.

Tweet 3: ""sh proshares short s & p 500 fund news URL $ sh $ amzn $ uup $ agen sh stockmarket pennystocks."" This mentions SH and AMZN again, along with the S&P 500. The term ""stockmarket"" could be positive or negative depending on what's trending.

Tweet 4: ""rt AT_USER amazon is working on app to pay normal people to deliver packages . URL $ amzn."" This seems more about AmZN specifically, mentioning a company named AT_USER who is developing an app. It doesn't mention any overall sentiment like up or down but talks about the app's functionality.

Lastly, tweet 5: ""$ amzn : amazon ponders crowdsourcing deliveries with "" on my way "" program : URL."" Again, focusing on AMZN and mentions a delivery program. There's no positive or negative word here either.

Putting it all together, the main keywords are AMZN, PBR (which I think is P/E ratio), S&P 500 index, and the idea that other stocks might be up. These seem to indicate a positive outlook for Amzn, suggesting the overall stock could go up. However, each tweet doesn't specify a strong or weak performance but more of an expectation or a trend they're following.

So, considering all these points, I think the sentiment is positive because there's an expectation that other stocks might go up and there are specific mentions about AMZN, which can sometimes signal positive news."
2015-06-17,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First tweet mentions ""power hour should be sweet,"" which seems unrelated. Maybe it's a typo or irrelevant.

Second tweet talks about hiring regular folks for delivering packages. This sounds like a practical job offer, but I'm not sure how that affects the company. It might help in the business or supply chain, but it doesn't directly talk about Amazon's performance yet.

Third tweet says $ amzn bac bidu ua it’s all greek to me - update from option millionaires... Oh wait, ""greek to me"" could mean I'm not familiar with the terms here. Maybe they're suggesting that this is a good time to invest because of the skill level? That's something investors might look at for stock buys.

Fourth tweet mentions ibb biotech and their dividend, but it doesn't specify where or what kind of dividend. It sounds like an announcement about future income for Amazon. If the dividends are good and growing, that could be positive for the stock price.

Fifth tweet says MSFT ORCL AMZN FB googl: millionaire factory is lagging on self-made lists. This might indicate that other investors have more money to fund their own platforms or operations. If a company doesn't follow trends like that, it might face issues in scaling or expansion.

Sixth tweet talks about cloud valuations being bloated. Cloud computing could be a big deal for Amazon, so if this is a concern about how valuable the cloud is, it might affect the stock price as investors look to capitalize on new tech.

Seventh tweet from multiple users about patience and showing revs lagging with margin shrinking. This sounds like a negative sign because if margins are shrinking, it could indicate issues in operations or product cost increases, which might reduce profit margins overall.

Eighth tweet mentions gains on penny stocks in 3 months. Penny stocks are cheaper than $1 per share, and large companies often trade for more. If Amazon is trading cheaply but has strong growth potential, maybe the stock will go up.

Ninth tweet says amzn inc dividend and is investing in stocks. More dividends can be a sign of confidence or expectation that earnings will improve, which might boost the stock price.

Tenth tweet mentions NMXS as talk of the town and Amazon's talks. If it's on a rise, investors are excited about the company's future, which can increase sentiment towards the stock.

Putting this together: The tweets indicate interest in dividend growth, potential for scaling through cloud tech, concerns with margins, penny stocks, and excitement around expansion. These all point to positive factors that could support Amazon's stock price."
2015-06-18,Positive,"Alright, let's try to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. I'm a bit new to analyzing social media trends, so I'll take it step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the tweets:

1. ""rt AT_USER hedge funds build big positions in alibaba URL $ amzn $ baba""
2. ""AT_USER a lot of talk about $ amzn on market guru , be happy to hear your thoughts URL""
3. ""AT_USER wow what a bus . i was busy in $ amzn and $ gild . you in ?""
4. ""rt marc faber : greece banks won't be open this monday and us live in neverland $ tsla $ goog $ amzn $ gpro $ nflx $ fb $ aapl $ goog $ ibm $ gld $ qqq""
5. ""$ amzn URL""
6. ""am zn inc . ideas URL $ amzn $ mbly $ nwbo $ nhc.to amzn stock finance""
7. ""how is $ nasv trading this low with $ 22,000 , 000 in revenues ? stocks $ amzn jimcramer currencytrader""
8. ""hznp horizon pharma plc ask URL $ hznp $ amzn $ kite $ smn hznp investing tradeideas""

Hmm, I can see that tweets 1 and 2 mention Amazon stock (amzn). Tweets 3 seems to be a joke or mockumentary about how busy someone was with Amazon. Tweets 4 is also a mockumentary about Greece's banks not being open on Monday. Tweets 5, 6, 7, and 8 are less clear but mention amzn in some cases.

So, the main focus seems to be on AMZN trading as it appears in multiple tweets: 1,2,4,5,6,7,8. The other tweets (3) might be irrelevant or not directly related to stock price impact.

Next, I need to break down each tweet into positive and negative factors.

From tweet 1:
- Positive: Hedge funds building positions.
- Negative: Not specified, so maybe neutral since it's just about actions without sentiment mentioned.

Wait, the user instructions say to analyze for Positive, Neutral, or Negative. Since there are no explicit negative cues except when Amazon is in the tweets, I'll focus on that.

From tweet 2:
- Positive: Being happy to hear thoughts.
- No clear negative factors here.

Tweet 3:
- It's a joke about being busy and maybe mocking something, so it doesn't add any information. So no impact.

Tweet 4:
- This seems like a mockumentary about Greece banks not being open. It could be seen as unrelated to Amazon but might suggest a positive outlook if the user is optimistic about the market.

Tweet 5:
- $ amzn URL: More information, maybe just confirming the stock name.

Tweet 6:
- Talks about AMZN's inc., which usually indicates growth potential. So that's a positive sign.

Tweet 7:
- Discusses low stock price and revenues. It says $22k in revenues but doesn't specify if it's good or bad. The context is about the company, not directly about Amazon.

Tweet 8:
- Hype about pharma, but again, not directly related to AMZN trading.

So, putting this together: tweets 1,2,4,5,6 mention AMZN in some way. Tweet 4 is speculative but could imply good market conditions. Tweets 5 and 6 indicate that AMZN is increasing, which might mean positive for Amazon's stock.

Therefore, the overall sentiment seems positive because multiple tweets are talking about AMZN doing well, including both confirmations (tweets 1,5) and general market expectations (tweets 4,6)."
2015-06-19,Negative,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative in terms of affecting Amazon's stock price. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at each tweet individually might be a good idea, but since the output requires just one line, I need to see if there's a trend across all the tweets that shows an overall effect on Amazon. 

Looking at the first tweet: jimmybob is talking about amzn being a 10x bigger guy and mentioning Friday again. That seems like a positive outlook, especially since ""bagger"" suggests higher performance. So this might be a positive factor.

The second tweet talks about market trends affecting multiple stocks: amzn, s&p, wbmh, abvv, etc. It mentions all these stocks moving, which could indicate overall market sentiment. But I'm not sure if that's enough on its own to tip the scale significantly. Plus, it doesn't specify how much impact each stock has, just that multiple are affected.

The third tweet mentions wal-mart stores, specifically asking about wmih and amzn. It seems like this is more of a minor update rather than an overall trend. I don't think this alone will strongly influence Amazon's stock.

The fourth tweet says there was huge variation in amzn's price, down by 439 points at 4:00 PM. That sounds very significant and negative because the stock dropped dramatically. This could have a major impact on investor confidence and can lead to a sharp decline, which would be negative overall sentiment.

The fifth tweet talks about inc. amzn using technical analysis, but it's for the 15-minute timeframe. Technical analysis doesn't necessarily mean positive or negative without context. It could show that stock prices are moving based on specific indicators, but unless there's an expected outcome, it might not have a strong impact.

The sixth tweet mentions bond pimco and another stock, amzn. This is talking about bonds rather than the company itself, so it doesn't affect Amazon directly. Not relevant for determining stock price changes.

The seventh tweet says that AT_USER, a user on amazon's unified approach to European e-commerce, has a positive effect. If users are more engaged or have better experiences, it can boost sales, which might positively impact Amazon's performance.

So compiling all this: the fourth tweet shows significant negative movement. The first and seventh tweets add some positive outlooks. However, since one of them is a massive drop in amzn stock, that alone is enough to tip the balance significantly towards negative sentiment. The other factors like user behavior might support expectations but don't outweigh the extreme price change.

I think the overall sentiment leans negatively because of the substantial decrease in amzn's price. Other positive tweets add supportive elements, but without a decisive event or significant movement, it doesn't dominate the impact."
2015-06-20,Neutral,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided several tweets and wants to determine their impact on the future stock price of a company. My task is to analyze these tweets and categorize them as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

First, I need to extract the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the tweets, some have specific stock symbols like ""mu micron technology , inc ."", which includes mu. Others mention ""amzn,"" ""xlp,"" ""ge,"" etc. So, it's possible that the company could be any of these, but without more context, I'll take the most common one for analysis, which is Amz.

Next, each tweet can be split into factors and sentiment analysis. For example, in the first tweet, ""mu micron technology , inc ."" has a URL with $ mu and mentions NASDAQ. The word ""ex-div date"" might indicate earnings or dividends. I'll need to parse these factors separately.

The user provided a list of tweets, each with various components like percentages, URLs, and sector names. My task is to separate positive (mu) from negative (nu) factors in each tweet and assess the overall sentiment on investor sentiment.

I should go through each tweet one by one. For each relevant tweet that includes the target stock, I'll identify any positive or negative keywords. Then, for each tweet, I'll determine if it's positively influencing, negatively influencing, or neutral towards the stock.

For instance, in tweet 2, ""rt mackeykyddandr 1 : xlp consumer staples select sector spdr financials URL $ xlp $ ge $ qcom $ amzn xlp pennystocks na..."" I can extract factors like ""consumer Staples"" and ""financials."" The word ""xlp"" might refer to a stock, so it's likely positive. The sentiment seems uncertain here.

I need to be cautious because not all tweets may contain relevant information about the target stock. Sometimes URLs are placeholders or unrelated mentions. Also, some tweets might not provide enough context on which factors they're evaluating, making it hard to assess their impact accurately.

Once I have all the relevant tweets for each stock, I'll combine them into a single list and analyze the sentiment of each tweet. If multiple positive tweets are present without any negative ones, it suggests an overall positive sentiment. Conversely, if there are both strong positive and neutral or even negative tweets, it's harder to determine a clear overall impact.

Since some tweets might be incomplete or ambiguous in terms of their context related to the stock price, I should consider that the impact could vary widely. Therefore, my analysis needs to be cautious and conclude with the most likely sentiment based on the available information.

In summary, I'll separate each tweet's factors, assess their sentiment, combine them for an overall view, but acknowledge that it might not be fully accurate due to the ambiguity of some tweets."
2015-06-21,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. That's usually at the beginning or end. 

Looking at tweet 1: ""amzn URL inc . day high URL $ am zn share stocks"". So the target stock is AMZN (Amazon).

Tweet 2: ""amzn URL inc . message board posts URL $ am zn cure mu egrx am zn stock stockmarket."" Hmm, not sure about this one. It mentions curing and egrx, which I don't recognize as stock symbols or companies. Maybe it's a typo or something else.

Tweet 3: ""top 5 father's day set ups : $ am zn elli epam logm payc"". Again, the target looks like AMZN again, but it mentions elli, epam, etc., which don't seem to be known stocks. Maybe this is a random tweet or an unrelated topic.

Now, for each tweet, I'll separate positive and negative factors. 

For tweet 1: ""amzn URL inc . day high URL $ am zn share stocks"". The positive aspect seems like the ""day high"" which could mean something good happened on that day regarding Amazon's stock price. So this is likely a positive factor.

Tweet 2: ""amzn URL inc . message board posts URL $ am zn cure mu egrx am zn stock stockmarket."" I don't see any specific information about AMZN in this tweet, so it might not have strong positive or negative factors. It's vague.

Tweet 3: ""top 5 father's day set ups : $ am zn elli epam logm payc"". Again, the target is AMZN, but the other words don't make sense to me. This seems like a random tweet without clear sentiment towards Amazon.

Putting it all together, only tweet 1 has a positive factor related to AMZN stock. The others are either vague or unrelated. So the overall sentiment should be Positive because of that one tweet."
2015-06-22,Neutral,"Alright, so I have to figure out how these tweets will impact the stock price of a company. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at the first tweet, I see mentions like ""spdr investor opinions"" and URLs that seem related to stock prices. Maybe the stock is SPDR or something similar? But without knowing which specific stock, this could be tricky. Similarly, in the second tweet, it's about mobile phones and shares on a few different companies. So, perhaps the target stock isn't clearly identified here.

Next, I need to perform a tweet-by-tweet analysis. Each tweet has positive (P) or negative (N) factors. For example, ""mbly mobileye nv shares URL $ mbly $ usos lnn amzn mbly pennystocks stocks."" This one has both positive and negative signs for the company names and stock symbols.

Then, I have to assess the sentiment of each tweet towards investor confidence. Positive tweets might push stock prices higher, while negative ones could drive them lower. But without knowing if these tweets are from investors or not, it's hard to gauge that.

Putting this together, the user provided a sample set of tweets but didn't specify which stock they're referring to. The output needs to conclude with one sentiment tag. Since I can't see the context about the stock and the analysis of each tweet, I'll have to make an educated guess based on common trends.

Positive tweets usually boost confidence, leading to gains. Negative ones may cause a dip. But without knowing if they're positive or negative, it's ambiguous. So, perhaps it's safer to say [Neutral], as without clear direction from the tweets themselves, it's hard to say for sure."
2015-06-23,Missing,File not found
2015-06-24,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets about AT_USER and some other stocks. Let me start by identifying each tweet's factors.

First tweet mentions AT_USER tips for day trading breaking news on several stocks. That sounds positive because it provides insider info or advice, which usually boosts confidence in the stock.

Second tweet says BKS is back to school for Barnes & Noble. That seems like a good thing because being back on their feet could improve performance, so this adds value and should be positive.

Third tweet talks about hacking purefunds shares using ise, specifically focused on cybersecurity ETFs. This could either be negative if the market is worried about security risks or positive if it's an opportunity. The mention of ""hack pennystocks investing"" might suggest some concern, but combined with other positives, maybe overall still positive.

Fourth tweet discusses EAASX being part of E.P.S., which could imply something about their performance or management. Not sure about the exact factors here; it might be ambiguous, so I'll keep that in mind.

Fifth tweet says Amazon is updating its customer reviews system. That's definitely good because it can improve user satisfaction and potentially boost stock price, so positive sentiment.

Sixth tweet introduces Amazon's instant video service with a dynamic range feature, available exclusively to prime members via their stock news app. This new feature might add value to customers, improving the company's image and could drive up prices, which is positive.

Now, compiling the factors: positive tweets 1, 2, 5, 6; negative tweet 3. Since there are more positive mentions, especially about back-to-school for Barnes & Noble and Amazon improvements, it leans towards a positive overall sentiment."
2015-06-25,Neutral,"Alright, I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company based on the given examples. The user provided several tweets about various companies, and I have to pick one to assess its impact.

First, looking at the example they gave: 
- Tweet 1 is about fagix and mentions financial terms.
- Tweet 2 talks about HPQ with investing keywords.
- Tweet 3 discusses Target Parts Ways mentioning E-commerce.
- Then there are multiple positive tweets from ABL (AMZN), others mention tech companies like TSLA, AMZN. One negative tweet says ""jobs: amazon to add 1000 more jobs"".

I think the user wants me to focus on one specific company and analyze its impact. But in the output, it's always about [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. So I have to pick a single tweet that represents a company.

Looking at the tweets provided, each has different companies mentioned: fagix is another company, HPQ is HPQ, Target Parts is TPL, ABL is Amazon, FB is Facebook, etc. It's unclear which one they're referring to since it's not specified in the problem. 

But wait, maybe I need to pick one from the given list that makes a clear sentiment. Let me see:

Looking through them, some are about stock prices with URLs and price changes. For example, ""fagix finance tradeideas"" which mentions trading ideas but doesn't specify if it's positive or negative. Similarly, ""hpq investing finance"" talks about investments.

Perhaps I should pick the one that clearly relates to a company's performance. If the user is analyzing stock trends, perhaps they want me to focus on a specific company listed in these tweets. 

Wait, maybe each tweet is about a different company? For example, fagix, HPQ, TPL, FB, etc. So without context, it's hard to pick one. Maybe I should choose the one that discusses a stock price change. Let's take ""amzn $ gtatq $ csco $ amzn fagix finance tradeideas"" as an example.

In this tweet, it mentions AMZN and talks about its financial terms like trading ideas. The URL is ""https://www.fagix.com/factory/36754829f2f516b8aeb3a08b8c26e0d4"", which looks like a company profile or another link.

Looking at the sentiment, it's just a price change. The user wants to assess impact on stock price based on tweets. So I need to analyze if the positive and negative factors support an increase or decrease in stock value.

The tweet is neutral because it's about trading ideas and prices, not specific earnings or news impacting the stock. It's speculative but mentions a company's financial terms without clear sentiment indicators. Therefore, perhaps this tweet would be considered [Neutral] as it doesn't provide evidence of positive or negative impact on stock price."
2015-06-26,Missing,File not found
2015-06-27,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a given company. The target stock symbol isn't specified here, but from the tweets it looks like Amazon (AMZN) is involved since some mention ""amzn"" or ""eem.""

Looking at tweet 1: It mentions the EEM ETF and other companies with high P/E ratios. I don't immediately recognize this as a positive or negative indicator for AMZN.

Tweet 2 talks about AT_USER, but I'm not sure what's being discussed here. The mention of a new York post article focusing on Amazon might indicate some positive attention or analysis, which could be positive sentiment.

Tweet 3 mentions the UK benefits from Amazon's increased focus on deliveries, referencing their stock symbol. If they're benefiting, that would be a positive indicator for AMZN's future price.

I don't see any negative or neutral sentiment mentioned here beyond the potential positive impact of tweet 3 and possibly some analysis in tweet 2 about Amazon. Combining these, it seems like there might be room for a Positive overall sentiment because the UK benefit is significant."
2015-06-28,Positive,"Alright, let's see what I need to do here. The user has provided four tweets and wants me to analyze their impact on the stock price of a company. They specified the output should be either [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet, it mentions ""ipgp ipg photonics corp."" Hmm, that seems like two stocks: ipgp and ipg photonics. But the overall sentiment is about a company's stock price, so perhaps only one of these should be considered? Maybe I'll take the first one, ipgp, since the others mention different companies. 

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. The second tweet mentions ""rt AT_USER nice to see $ amzn shaking off its downgrade this morning."" That sounds like a positive outlook because it's updating on amzn's stock after it was downgraded.

The third tweet talks about SBUX, which is Starbucks. It mentions charts and investing, so that's probably neutral or slightly positive since tech stocks are generally up these days. 

Fourth tweet discusses GREEK Ripples or Economic Fireworks affecting S&P 500 (SIX) etc. I'm not sure if this is positive or negative because Greek issues can be volatile. But looking at the subsequent line, it says $ amzn received a new alert on stocks daytrading trading mkt nyse nas… That might imply mixed sentiment since it's an event-driven tweet.

The fifth tweet mentions AMZN getting a new alert about stocks. This seems similar to the fourth one but more specific. It could be affecting investor sentiment as well, possibly pushing the stock higher or lower depending on the alert message.

Now, combining all this information: The first tweet just lists several stocks, which is neutral since it's not directly impacting a single stock's price. The second tweet is positive about amzn's outlook. The third tweet is moderate and positive with tech stocks generally being strong. The fourth tweet introduces some uncertainty between Greek issues and economic events, so could be neutral or slightly negative. The fifth tweet is another event-driven message that might have mixed sentiment.

So overall, considering all these factors—positive tweets influencing amzn's outlook and the context of news affecting investor behavior—it seems like there's a mix but leaning towards positive. Therefore, I'd classify it as [Positive]."
2015-06-29,Neutral,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify each tweet and extract the relevant information. The main target stock is Amazon, so any tweet mentioning ""amzn"" will be important. I'll go through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions $ amzn with a negative number at the end. That seems like an indicator of strong bullish sentiment because negative numbers in stock prices usually mean they're underperforming.
2. The second tweet talks about Naspers's profit gains and misses analyst estimates, which is positive news for the company. But since it's just one tweet, I can't be sure how much this affects Amazon.
3. Third tweet is about ptct ptc, but it mentions amzn and vfc, so relevant to Amazon.
4. The fourth tweet also includes amzn in a lot of other words, which probably means there are opinions from investors.
5. Fifth tweet discusses wd walker's news regarding amzn.
6. Sixth tweet talks about ppch stock movement, again related to amzn.
7. Seventh tweet mentions spxs and cyb, focusing on s & p 500 performance.
8. Eighth tweet is about marketmovers affecting ebay and ge, which relates more to other companies, not directly Amazon.

So, the main points are that multiple tweets mention Amazon in some way, either as part of a price or discussing things related to it. The first tweet shows strong bullish indicators, while others don't give a complete picture but indicate potential positive news for Amazon.

Given that there's a significant amount of positive and negative mentions surrounding amzn, I'm leaning towards a neutral opinion because the sentiment isn't clear-cut. However, the overall impact from the positive tweets might tip the scales slightly in favor of a positive outcome."
2015-06-30,Negative,"Alright, let's see what I need to do here. The user has given me some tweets about two stocks and wants me to determine their impact on their future stock price. They provided specific steps: first, extract the target stock symbol from each tweet, then analyze each tweet by separating positive and negative factors and assessing sentiment. Finally, combine these analyses into an overall sentiment.

Looking at the tweets:

1. The first tweet mentions ""pfe pfizer , inc . financials URL $ pfe $ amzn $ ellc $ intc pfe pennystocks investing."" I notice the word ""pfe"" is repeated. Since pfe is the ticker symbol for PFE, which stands for Pfizer, that's clear. The other symbols like amzn are Amazon, ellc doesn't seem relevant to either, but perhaps it's a typo or extra info. The URL part might be irrelevant here. So I'll focus on ""pfe"" as the target stock.

2. The second tweet is ""cur neuralstem , inc . ask size URL $ cur $ ugaz $ amzn $ cybr cur stocks invest."" Again, ""cur"" could refer to Cura, and ""ugaz"" doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a typo for ""ugan"" or another company. ""Neuralstem"" sounds like a company in the biotech field, which is related to tech, maybe healthcare. Amzn is Amazon. Cybr might be a typo too. The main point is again focusing on ""cur,"" but since Cura isn't a known stock, I'll ignore it for now.

Now, analyzing each tweet:

For ""pfe pfizer , inc . financials URL ..."": The mention of Pfizer suggests positive news about the company's financial performance or market position. It could be good news if they're doing well, which would boost PFE's stock. However, since I don't have external data, it's just speculative.

For ""cur neuralstem , inc . ask size URL $ cur $ ugaz $ amzn $ cybr cur stocks invest"": Cura being a small biotech company or tech-focused entity might be in a good position if they're expanding into new markets. But without more context, it's hard to assess. If the tweet is about ""neuralstem,"" which I'm not familiar with, maybe it suggests growth potential.

Considering each tweet separately isn't enough because they both refer to PFE and Cura. Their performance depends on each other or broader market conditions. Since I don't have specific data, my conclusion should be neutral because the information is speculative and based on assumptions."
2015-07-01,Positive,"Alright, so I've got to analyze these tweets about Amazon's stock and determine whether it's positive, neutral, or negative for their future price. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at each tweet individually might not be enough because they all seem related. For example, the first tweet says Amazon is selling a lot of e-books, which could mean they're investing in more digital products, affecting their revenue and stock value. The second tweet mentions something about a message board posts related to Amazon stock, maybe indicating investor sentiment.

But since all these tweets are connected to Amazon's performance, I think it's better to analyze them collectively rather than one by one. Let me go through each one:

1. The first tweet talks about e-books and investing in more digital products. That suggests growth potential.
2. The second tweet mentions a message board with stock-related content. Maybe investors are active on their platform, which could mean positive sentiment.
3. The third tweet says the user can rent the stock URL, implying access to some product or service. This might be seen as a sign of increased activity, possibly positive for Amazon.
4. The fourth tweet is a repeat of point 3, reinforcing that they're active in their space.
5. The fifth tweet mentions Amazons anthem filing and stock info. Filing could indicate regulatory activity or company decisions, which might affect investor confidence.
6. The sixth tweet posts about stock prices on pennystocks, maybe indicating interest from other investors or a competitive market.
7. The seventh tweet talks about cloud tech accelerating through recessions but still in early days for Amazon's growth. This shows some optimism about the market expansion but with caution because of current economic uncertainties.

Putting it all together: Amazon is investing in more e-books and digital products, active on social media platforms like message boards, planning to rent their stock URL, and has ongoing announcements related to cloud services. However, there are also mentions of filing-related news which might be seen as less favorable for the company. But overall, these factors point towards potential growth.

Hmm, I'm not sure if the filing announcement is a good sign or just another negative note. Maybe it's more about compliance rather than market sentiment. So, considering all the positive aspects like increasing e-books and active social media engagement versus some caution from regulatory filings, it seems there's a mix of possible impacts. But perhaps the overall sentiment leans slightly positive because Amazon is expanding into new areas without significant negatives overshadowing the positives.

Wait, but I should consider that if there are conflicting or mixed signals, it might not be clear-cut. However, since all tweets are about Amazon and its e-books, message boards, stock-related topics, I'll go with the trend of expansion and potential growth despite the regulatory aspect.

So, overall sentiment is probably positive."
2015-07-02,Positive,"Alright, so I've got this task where I need to analyze a set of tweets and determine their impact on a company's stock price using a scoring system of [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. The final output should be just one line with the tag.

First, let me break down what's required. There are five tweets provided. Each tweet is about a different stock: $amzn, $tlt, and others like $mcox and $sne. I'll need to go through each one step by step.

Starting with the first tweet: ""$ suti has now seen 400 % gains in the past 2 weeks ! special update : URL $ orcl $ yhoo $ amzn"". Hmm, ""gains"" here might be a typo and should probably be ""profitable."" That's positive. It mentions specific stocks like ORCL, YOO, AMZN, which are all publicly traded companies. Positive trends could indicate confidence in their performance.

Next tweet: ""$ tlt $ amzn $ aapl $ fb july 2nd , 2015 watch list - update from option millionaires - stock options chatroom markets ... URL"". This is looking like a news article with an event date July 2, 2015. It mentions the S&P 500 index and stock options. The context seems to be market updates or earnings reports. Without specific details on what happened, it's hard to assess sentiment. Maybe neutral since we don't know if it was positive or negative.

Third tweet: ""$ amzn stock message board updated thursday , july 2 , 2015 10:11 : 21 am $ xoom $ trq $ ddd $ iyt URL"". This is another news feed update. The date is in July, and the company's message boards are being updated. Positive because companies often announce earnings or product updates to attract more traffic.

Fourth tweet: ""$ our penny stock newsletter alerts gained 200 % in 2 weeks ! get our next pick early : URL $ amzn $ mcox $ goog"". This is a newsletter promoting a penny stock, AMZN. The message says their newsletter gained big returns in two weeks and invites readers to pick the next stock. If this is related to AMZN performance, it's positive because it reflects better news about the stock.

Fifth tweet: ""$ all we have to do is enter a ticker and we get this for any company . $ amzn -> URL URL"". This seems like a generic message from a service where you just type in a stock code and they send the information. It's more of an introduction or a feature update rather than providing news about earnings or trends, so it might be considered neutral since there's no specific positive or negative info.

Now, summarizing each tweet:

1. Positive because of 400% gains.
2. Neutral due to unknown event date and context.
3. Positive as message boards are updated.
4. Positive due to big newsletter returns.
5. Neutral because it's a feature update without news content.

Each positive tweet adds confidence, so overall sentiment is likely positive."
2015-07-03,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on a company's stock price. The user provided some tweets, but they don't include specific stocks or details about the company. Instead, they seem to be talking about various topics related to investments and stocks in general.

First, looking at tweet 1: ""ung united states natural gas fund ask URL $ ung $ avgo $ amzn $ uvxy..."" Hmm, this seems like a link request or an announcement of an investment from an UNG fund. The mention of AGOZAL (avgo) and AMZN suggests it's related to tech stocks or energy companies. 

Wait, maybe it's about AGOZAL, which is a company that provides natural gas? But without knowing the stock symbol, I can't tell much.

Moving on to tweet 2: ""rdus radius health , inc . stock forum URL $ rdus $ paas $ pmcb $ amzn..."" Again, this seems like an investment from RDUS or RDU (possibly RDSB) and PAAS. They're also talking about AMZN and nasdaq, which is a major stock exchange.

Tweet 3: ""sine wave island play the oscillations . $ amzn URL ~ via URL."" This is more technical. It's mentioning sine waves in market fluctuations and an Amazon stock URL. So, this tweet is likely signaling news about Amazon's performance or any related news.

Tweet 4: ""xle energy select sector spdr short sales URL $ xle $ xiu.to $ ewj $ amzn..."" Here, XLE (Xbox) is mentioned in a short sales context. They're linked to SPDR (S&P 500) and AMZN. This could indicate investor sentiment on the energy sector or Amazon's stock.

Tweet 5: ""amzn sphere 3d corp . current price URL $ amzn $ smn $ googl $ vwo amzn invest nasdaq"" Again, looking at AMZN, Sphere 3D,googl (Google), VWO. It seems like a company announcement or market update regarding AMZN.

Tweet 6: ""amzn db x-trackers harvest csi 300 china a-shares fund stock forum URL $ amzn $ crs . v $ gdx $ tlt amzn invest invest"" This one mentions AMZN, DB (double beta), X-Trackererharv, CSI 300, China A-Shares Fund. It's also about investment forums and other stocks.

So, summarizing the tweets: They all involve investing in different sectors—natural gas for tweet1, energy, natural gas fund; tech or energy companies for tweets 4 and 6; AMZN for multiple tweets including 2,3,5,6. Additionally, these tweets are discussing market fluctuations (like oscillations on tweet3), price trends (current price announcements on 4 and 6) and investor sentiment about short sales or short-covering in the energy sector (tweets 4).

I think each tweet is signaling something about the company's stock—either a potential investment opportunity, an announcement of a short position, or market conditions affecting AMZN. However, without knowing which specific stocks are being targeted and how exactly these tweets will affect investor sentiment, it's hard to assign a positive, neutral, or negative overall impact.

But considering the multiple mentions of AMZN across different tweets, which is a major tech stock, it's likely that this tweet is about a significant event impacting AMZN. If there's news related to AMZN's performance, its stock could rise or fall accordingly. The other topics like natural gas and energy might be tangential but still relevant because they are different sectors.

So, maybe the overall sentiment isn't clear-cut because it depends on how these tweets affect a specific stock. However, if we assume that each tweet is about a positive investment opportunity, the impact would likely be positive for AMZN."
2015-07-04,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for a given company. The user provided six tweets about different stocks and asked for an assessment of their likely impact on the stock price using ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"" tags.

First, I need to identify each tweet's target stock. Looking at the first tweet: ""alr alere inc . ask URL $ alr $ rdus $ amzn $ uso alr finance share."" The target stock here seems to be Amazon (AMZN) because it's mentioned multiple times with a dollar sign and keywords like finance share.

Now, analyzing each tweet one by one. 

1. ""alr alere inc . ask URL $ alr $ rdus $ amzn $ uso alr finance share"" - This tweet mentions AMZN but doesn't provide a clear sentiment or any positive or negative factors directly related to the stock's performance. It seems neutral because there's no indication of buying, selling, or any expected changes in the stock price.

2. The second tweet is part of a longer list. Without context, it's hard to tell what's being discussed here. Maybe it's about another stock? However, without more information, I can't assess its impact on AMZN.

3. ""rt AT_USER five minute trades - $ aapl $ fb $ googl $ goog $ gpro $ ibb $ lnkd $ qqq $ spy $ twtr $ v $ tsla $ nflx $ baba $ amzn - URL"" – This tweet mentions several stock symbols, but none are related to AMZN. It's about various stocks and trading information without any specific positive or negative factors for a particular stock.

4. "" msm msc industrial direct co . 52wk high URL $ msm $ tmmi $ gdx $ amzn msm share pennystocksmxim maxim integrated …"" – Similar to the third tweet, this seems to be about another stock that doesn't relate directly to AMZN. No clear sentiment or factors affecting AMZN's price.

5. "" usable united states oil fund , lp ask URL $ usable $ jnug $ hgu.to $ amzn usable stockmarket pennystocksuup powershares db us …"" – Again, this tweet mentions AMZN and other stocks. It doesn't provide any positive or negative indicators for AMZN's performance.

6. "" AT_USER vtr ventas , inc . % change URL $ vtr $ cemp $ amzn $ bbd vtr share invest"" – This tweet is also about another stock, not related to AMZN. It discusses a company's percentage change but doesn't indicate a positive or negative impact on AMZN.

Considering all the tweets, none of them directly mention AMZN except for one tweet that mentions it. That tweet seems neutral because there are no clear buy-sell signals or expected changes in price. The other tweets focus on different stocks without any context on AMZN's performance.

Therefore, I'll conclude with ""[Neutral]"" since there's no clear positive or negative impact from the provided tweets."
2015-07-05,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this analysis for the given tweets about a company's stock price impact.

First, I need to understand what each tweet is saying and identifying any positive or negative factors it might have. The first tweet says, ""Our penny stock newsletter alerts gained 200% in 2 weeks! Get our next pick early: URL $ amzn $ mcox $ goog."" So, the user is announcing a newsletter that boosted their stock by 200%, which sounds very positive.

Next, looking at the second tweet: ""$ btu peabody energy corp URL $ uco $ ief $ panw $ ziop uc nasdaq invest $ lnkd $ slv $ amzn $ ddc … URL."" It seems to be a link or announcement about another company. I'm not immediately sure what that's offering, so maybe it's neutral.

The third tweet is: ""rt valuewalk : wally weitz letter to investors : value matters URL $ vrx $ lbtyk $ googl $ amzn $ br … URL."" This one mentions a newsletter about ValueWalk by Wally Weitz. I don't have specific information on ValueWalk's impact, but perhaps it could be positive or neutral.

Now, combining these thoughts: The first tweet is definitely positive because of the large percentage gain. The second and third tweets are less clear, but maybe each could contribute a mixed effect. However, since there's at least one strong positive (the 200% boost), I think the overall sentiment is leaning towards Positive."
2015-07-06,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. 

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at tweet 1, it mentions ""AMZN"" as part of the URL, so I'm guessing that's Amazon, Inc.

Next, I have to break down each tweet into positive and negative factors. For each tweet, I should look for any statements that are supportive or contradictory about Amazon.

Looking at tweet 1: It says ""trying to invent its own 'black friday' retail event."" That sounds like a negative thought because black Friday is usually a big shopping day for holiday shoppers, so making someone think of it as something different might be a negative message. So this tweet contributes negatively.

Then there's a call volume note on $ spy july 211 calls. I know that ""spy"" here is probably referring to SPY, which is the S&P 500 ETF. The number and frequency of calls can affect stock sentiment. High call volumes can sometimes indicate investor fear or uncertainty, but without more context, it's hard to tell if this is positive or negative for Amazon.

 Tweet 3 talks about buying almost everything on Amazon but not investing in the stock. This seems contradictory because a tweet like that usually indicates concern or worry. It suggests someone isn't seeing the investment aspect clearly, which can be seen as negative because it might lead people to avoid the stock based on other factors they think are more important.

Now, putting this together: There's one tweet with strong negatives and one with mixed signals. The overall sentiment seems to lean towards negative because of those conflicting or contradictory statements. So the impact is probably a negative effect on Amazon's stock price."
2015-07-07,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether these tweets are positive, negative, or neutral in terms of their impact on stock prices for a company. Let's go through each tweet step by step.

Starting with the first tweet: ""xgd.to ishares cdn s & p / tsx global gold index fund volume URL $ xgd.to $ amzn $ cybr $ dis xgd.to pennystocks stocks."" Hmm, it looks like this one mentions a company called Pennystocks. They're sharing some information about their stock and the companies they're investing in. The user is using Twitter, so I guess they might be tracking a specific stock's performance or something related to the industry. But without knowing what exactly they're investing in, it's hard to tell if this will directly impact their stock price. It could be either positive or negative depending on the company.

Moving on to the second tweet: ""our platinum subscribers saw their penny stock alerts gain over 200 % in 2 weeks ! big update : URL $ orcl $ yhoo $ amzn."" Again, the user is likely referring to a specific stock, possibly Apple (AAPL) since they mention ORCL and others. The tweet mentions a significant increase in alerts for their platinum subscribers, which could imply that their stock is doing well. That sounds positive.

Third tweet: ""$ amzn "" says ""rt AT_USER "" step aside black friday : meet primeday , "" says $ am zn , scheduled for the dog days of summer on july 15 . URL."" This one seems to be announcing something about Amazon (AMZN), specifically that Black Friday is over and they're going back to their prime time. This could be a positive sign, showing that companies like Amazon are making waves during major holidays. So this would likely boost the stock.

Fourth tweet: ""$ aapl $ amat $ amgn $ amtd $ amzn $ atvi trade long or long + short positions from the nasdaq , up to 1500 % since 2010 . URL $ qqq."" This one is focusing on Apple's stock. The user mentions that Apple has made significant trades, specifically holding shares (long or short), and this percentage increase since 2010 is quite high, which suggests strong positions in the company. That would be a positive indicator.

Putting it all together: The first tweet could have mixed signals, the second is definitely positive for Apple, the third is about Amazon making big waves during Black Friday, and the fourth is confirming significant trades with an impressive percentage increase. So overall, there's evidence of strong performance from both companies mentioned, which is a good sign for the stock price."
2015-07-08,Missing,File not found
2015-07-09,Neutral,"Alright, so I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the future stock price of a company. The user has given me some specific tweets and asked me to analyze them into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments. Let's break this down step by step.

First, let me understand what each tweet says. 

Looking at the first tweet: ""$ appf appfolio inc URL $ fb $ googl $ lnkd $ twtr $ aapl $ sne $ msft $ ko $ sina $ amzn $ baba ko p … URL"". Hmm, that looks like some company names and URLs, but it's a bit confusing. Maybe it's listing stock ticker symbols? If so, each symbol might represent a different company. So, for example, FB is Facebook, GOOGL is Google, LNK is likely an abbreviation I'm not familiar with—maybe ""Long"", but I know that doesn't make sense in this context. TAAK is something else, and SINE is sine trading? sina is a company name, AMZN is Amazon, BABA is Beta Asymmetric Artificial. 

But without knowing the specific companies, it's tricky to analyze each one individually. Maybe the idea was to list multiple companies whose stock prices could be affected. The user probably wants me to assess the overall impact on these stocks collectively.

The second tweet: ""$ rt AT_USER wall street breakfast : china rebounds but worries persist URL $ spy $ qqq $ aa $ amzn $ ba $ bamxy $ chtr $ dd …"". This one seems like it's from a user, possibly an employee or another stakeholder. The phrase ""ch rip"" might be a typo for ""chris,"" and the hashtags include ""China rebounds but worries persist."" 

So, in this tweet, there are multiple stock symbols: SPY is S&P 500 index ETF, QQQ is S&P 500 ETF, AA could be Alphabet Inc., AMZN is Amazon, BA isbeta Asymmetric Artificial, BAMXY is something else, and CHTR might not make sense. The quotes suggest a mix of bullish and cautious views about China's economic outlook.

Putting this together, the user is providing information on multiple stocks and their economic viewpoints. It seems like they're trying to gauge investor sentiment around these companies. If investors are more optimistic about China, which is often correlated with other global markets, it could impact stock prices.

I need to consider the collective sentiment rather than individual tweets. The tweet mentions concerns that China's economy might rebound but worries persist. This mix of optimism and uncertainty might lead some investors to expect mixed results for the companies listed, possibly affecting their stock price trends over time."
2015-07-10,Positive,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the future stock price of a given company. Let me start by understanding the steps outlined in the previous thinking process.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet, it includes words like $ f $ twx $ amzn $ gild $ rdn and mentions ""spns"" and ""vrtu"". Hmm, that doesn't seem to spell anything meaningful. Maybe it's a typo or an abbreviation I'm not familiar with. Let me check more tweets.

The second tweet talks about SPXU and mentions ""ultra"" short s & p 500 dividend. That's familiar; S&P 500 is a major stock index, often referred to as the ""S&P"". So maybe the target stock here is SPXU? Although that seems a bit odd because SPXU isn't a commonly traded index.

Third tweet has ""aryc arrayit corp . exchange"" which suggests it's about a company named Aryc Arrayit. The rest of the words include finance, trade ideas, and URLs like ""url.com"". Maybe this is indicating that the stock price for Aryc Arrayit is changing?

Fourth tweet mentions $ appf appfolio inc, so another possible target could be AppFolio. This one's a bit vague since it doesn't specify the company directly.

Fifth tweet talks about Amazon (AMZN) and includes words like ""nasdaq"" and ""finance"". So likely related to AMZN stock.

Sixth tweet is about Plug ( plugs ) power, an inc., and mentions investing and stocks. Maybe referring to Plugs Power Inc., which is a tech company involved in power solutions.

Putting it together, the tweets mention several companies: AMZN, SpXU, Aryc Arrayit, AppFolio, Plugs Power, and maybe others like Gildas (GILD), Rdn (which might be RND), and Tesla (TSLA).

Now, for each tweet, I need to identify positive or negative factors. 

1. The first tweet talks about $f$ etc., which I'm not sure about but possibly something minor.
2. Second: mentions dividend, so a positive factor like strong dividends could be good news.
3. Third: mentions GILD, which might mean the stock is undervalued or has some weakness.
4. Fourth: AppFolio is a company that makes integrated power solutions, which is promising for tech investors.
5. Fifth: AMZN is a well-known stock with strong earnings and growth potential.
6. Sixth: Plugs Power's involvement in energy solutions could be positive for renewable markets.

Next step: assess sentiment based on these factors. Positive factors like strong dividends or GILD might boost the overall sentiment. But if there are negative points, it could pull it down.

I think Amzn is up, so that's a good sign. SpXU being odd but maybe not related to AMZN, so less likely. Aryc Arrayit and AppFolio seem promising. Plugs Power's focus on energy tech might benefit solar or wind stocks. Gildas could be undervalued.

Overall, since many positive factors are mentioned (AMZN, GILD, Plugs Power, AppFolio), the sentiment is probably Positive. But I should check if any negative points are missed. The first tweet was unclear, but others seem solid. So final assessment: Positive."
2015-07-11,Negative,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, each tweet is analyzed for its factors—positive and negative. Then, the sentiment of each tweet influences investor mood. Finally, combining all this info gives a clear overall sentiment.

Looking at tweet 1: It seems like Amazon is rebranding their URL, which could be seen as a positive move since companies with good growth potential might change their names to attract more traffic. But I'm not sure if that's enough to conclude definitively.

Tweet 2 mentions the Vanguard bond index fund, and it says it'll ask for money. That sounds like selling stock holdings, which would definitely lower sentiment.

Tweet 3 is a bit unclear but includes ""pretty sure the echo will improve."" If Amazon's performance in their echo platform improves, that could be positive.

Tweet 4 talks about trading with stocks to start on the stock market and mentions several indices: spy, nflx, yum, aapl. This seems like a call to action for investors without necessarily adding anything positive or negative yet.

Tweet 5 is quite detailed with various news points from CSCO, CISCOS, etc., but nothing specific about Amazon. It includes ""ondemand"" and others, which could be a mix of positive and neutral information.

Lastly, tweet 6 mentions ""finance"" and ""trader,"" suggesting they're in the financial sector but not adding much to Amazon's performance yet.

Putting it all together: positive actions like rebranding and stock trading (tweet 4) might be good, but the negative tweet (2) is a clear sell. The other tweets don't add much. So overall, the sentiment seems mixed but leaning towards neutral because one tweet clearly lowers expectations."
2015-07-12,Positive,"Okay, so I have to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by going through each tweet one by one.

First tweet: ""amzn URL inc . % change URL $ amzn $ dal $ xlv $ data amzn share stock."" The word ""share stock"" seems relevant because it mentions Amazon selling shares, which is usually a positive signal for investors. So that's a positive factor.

Second tweet: ""spxs direxion daily s & p 500 bear 3x shares company info URL $ spxs $ amzn $ vltc $ pvsp spxs invest pennystocks."" Here, they mention the S&P 500 is in a bear market with 3X growth potential. A bear market can be positive if it's seen as a temporary dip that might recover, so maybe the tweet is indicating an upward trend due to expected growth. This could boost Amazon's stock.

Third tweet: ""our stock pick on $ ppch is up over 300 % since our original release at . 02 ! huge news : URL $ orcl $ yhoo $ amzn"" Here, the user mentions a significant increase in their chosen stock and highlights that it's been around for almost two years. A longer-term upgrade could be seen as good news, especially if other factors are favorable.

Fourth tweet: ""dd dupont co . prev close URL $ dd $ grcu $ amzn $ kite dd invest stockdepo depomed , inc . volume …"" This seems like an update on a company's performance or financials. If stockdepo depomed is doing well, that could be positive. But without more info, it's hard to tell for sure.

Fifth tweet: ""orc orchid island capital , inc . financials URL $ orc $ supn $ xlb $ amzn orc share invest"" The user mentions another company (orchid) and the word ""financials."" Financial health can be good news if they're improving. But again, not enough info to determine definitively.

Now, for each tweet, I need to identify positive or negative factors. For example, in the third tweet, ""300% increase"" is a strong positive number. In the fourth, mentions of stock performance is mixed but could be positive. 

Sentiment-wise, some tweets are more speculative (like the third) and others are about known company news (first two). The sentiment tends to be positive for many of them because they're showing growth potential or significant achievements.

Considering all these factors together, the overall impact seems positive. There's a mix of short-term gains and longer-term upgrades, which could balance out but give a favorable signal to investors. So I'll conclude with [Positive]."
2015-07-13,Negative,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet one by one and see what they're saying.

First, the target stock is $AMZN. 

1. The first tweet mentions several URLs but doesn't provide any information about AMZN. It just talks about web services and announcements. So, I don't think this affects anything.
   
2. The second tweet says Amazon announced a renewable energy project. That's good news for investors because renewable energy is generally seen as a positive investment, especially in clean energy. This could boost the stock price.

3. Third tweet is about consumer discretionary spending increasing by 2.85%, which might be a positive sign. However, it also mentions some economic indicators like EIS +22 and NQ +75.50. That's pretty volatile, so I'm not sure if that adds to the overall positive sentiment.

4. Fourth tweet talks about an Amazon video being added to a user's playlist on Wal-Mart. This is more of a promotional move rather than any earnings or news related to AMZN stock. So, maybe it doesn't have much impact.

5. Fifth tweet asks if Amazon can break highs. That sounds like a question prompting investor confidence. If people are asking whether the stock could spike, that's positive because it might encourage others to buy and think more about AMZN's future.

6. Sixth tweet mentions privacy concerns over Amazon's Echo device. This is a serious issue in tech and could lead to decreased consumer trust, which is negative for Amazon. They're probably scared of competitors, so this could hurt the stock price.

7. Seventh tweet notes that AT_USER found interesting leaders on the SL50 list this morning, mentioning Blue, NFLX, AMZN, and UA. This seems like a marketing strategy, maybe to attract more shares or investors. It's positive for AMZN because it might help with user growth.

8. Eighth tweet talks about Microsoft's rackspace agreement in ""fanatical"" cloud and mentions GOG and AMZN. Cloud services can be expensive, so this could cost Amazon money, which would likely lower their stock price. Also, they're using the term ""fanatical,"" which is a bit unclear, but maybe implying big expectations.

9. Ninth tweet has some text that looks like an update on a stock option chat room. The number of shares read seems low (7-13-15), and it's from Monday morning with updates about AMZN. It might be new information or news, which could affect the price. If they're reading something important, it could boost the sentiment positively.

10. Tenth tweet talks about AT_USER taking over a sales extravaganza event on July 15th. This seems like a promotional event with no mention of AMZN stock. But maybe it's about a new product or partnership, which is usually good for the company. It could indirectly boost the price.

Now, putting this all together: Some tweets are positive (renewable energy project, user recommendations), some negative (privacy concerns, cloud agreements). The main ones are 2 and 7 which are positive, but 6 and 9 have serious issues that could be negatives. 5 is a question which can impact investor sentiment. So the overall sentiment seems mixed with some positives, one significant event, and several negatives."
2015-07-14,Negative,"Alright, I'm trying to analyze these tweets about Amazon's stock price impact. First, I need to extract the stock symbol. Looking through each tweet, most mention AMZN, so I'll use that as my target.

Now, for each tweet, I have to separate positive and negative factors. Let me go through them one by one:

1. ""i think i might stick to my same trades from yesterday : $ fb $ amzn $ ba watching : airlines : $ save $ aal $ dal travel : $ pcln $ expe $ oww"" — This is mostly positive, focusing on flights and travel as investments.

2. ""rt AT_USER ' amazon studios ' - - $ amzn is said to have set aside $ 200 million to finance films URL."" Here, it mentions Amazon investing money for films, which might be a negative factor because it's not related to the company itself.

3. ""esports : the future of entertainment URL $ amzn $ atvi $ fb $ goog URL"" — Positive about entertainment trends and AMZN being involved in that.

4. ""early movers : $ jpm , $ ko , $ urbn , $ intc , $ oww & more $ mu $ amzn $ gpro $ jblu $ vlo $ dal $ sbux $ save $ goog $ nok URL"" — Positive mentions of other companies but also includes negative terms like ""nok.""

5. ""$ amzn real tempted to chase should've pulled the trigger at least i caught $ nflx prior to run up earningsseason lifeofatrader."" Here, it's talking about AMZN chasing a follow-up stock and mentioning previous earnings, which might be positive.

6. ""nasdaq 100 stocks trend $ grmn $ alxn $ googl $ amzn $ fb $ trip $ sbux $ atvi $ regn $ ebay $ fisv $ cmcsa $ nflx $ orly @ … …"" — Mostly negative mentions of tech stocks, which could be a factor.

7. ""is free shipping killing amazon ’ s profit ? URL $ amzn has bigger issues if offering free-shipping is problematic."" This is clearly negative about Amazon's profitability due to free shipping policy.

8. ""$ amzn real tempted to chase should've pulled the trigger at least i caught $ nflx prior to run up earningsseason lifeofatrader"" — Repeating some positive points but again, focusing on a follow-up stock.

9. ""jimmybob : $ amzn 469 : jimmybob URL"" — Not much here; it's just a link and symbol without any negative or positive statements.

10. ""$ twtr twitter inc URL $ baba $ aapl $ fb $ twtr $ nflx $ googl $ tsla $ amzn $ pcln $ prmtx $ fold $ scmp $ fv prmtx tradeideas ..."" — Positive mentions of other tech stocks and AMZN, but overall it's neutral because there are both positive and negative elements.

Now, I'll assess the sentiment for each tweet. It seems most tweets are positive except for a couple that hint at potential issues or negatives. The overall market trend might be mixed due to the mix of positive and negative comments. However, since AMZN is mentioned in many tweets and they're investing a lot into technology and entertainment, it's leaning towards a positive outlook but with some room for doubt."
2015-07-15,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. I'm not an expert, but I'll go through each tweet step by step.

First, I need to identify which tweets affect Amazon's stock and then assess their sentiment towards it.

Looking at tweet 1: It talks about prime day being good for Amazon. That sounds positive because it affects investor sentiment. So that's a + sign.

Tweet 2 is similar, just another mention of prime day. Again, reinforcing the positive aspect. So now I'm seeing two positive tweets so far.

Tweet 3 mentions peak order rates surpassing Black Friday. If this relates to sales or demand, that would be good for Amazon. So positive again.

Twitter 4 seems like a promotional link for their future picks, which could attract more subscribers. That's generally positive because it increases visibility. So + votes.

Tweet 5 talks about alerts gaining 4000% over 10 months, which is very strong news. High growth numbers are definitely positive.

Tweet 6 mentions a spin on Sony spinning off its music business for investors. While this could be a good thing if the business is profitable and increases Amazon's revenue, I'm not sure about the immediate impact on stock price. Maybe neutral or slight.

Twitter 7 talks about a june 14 release of $ amzn. If it's an event that affects demand, like earnings, it might boost the stock. So positive.

Tweet 8 is more of a commentary than an actual tweet—trying to express a opinion but doesn't directly say if Amazon is up or down. That's neutral because I don't have direct info from them.

Tweet 9 mentions $27.95 spending for a building named after people, which might not be related to stock performance.

Twitter 10 talks about the NASDAQ connection with Amazon and how prime day is shaping up. Positive sentiment here.

Tweet 11 discusses primeday tweets being hard to read, but without any direct information about Amazon's stock or performance, it's probably neutral.

Tweet 12 refers to a study on Lee's streaming services, which might not directly impact Amazon. Neutral again.

Tweet 13 lists several companies related to Amazon, including Tesla and others. This is more about the company as a whole rather than individual tweets affecting the stock. So maybe a mix of positive elements but overall neutral.

Twitter 14 talks about $ amzn being featured on an iPhone parse site, which could attract more subscribers—positive.

Tweet 15 mentions that the tweet was featured and has a -1 sentiment. The user is using Twitter's sentiment indicators. A negative sentiment might indicate a lack of confidence or expectation, but it depends on context.

Twitter 16 discusses a prediction about $ msft and other NASDAQ indices. If Amazon is expected to perform well, especially given prime day could be a big event, this could be positive.

Tweet 17 talks about bond performance from a speaker at Deliverable Alpha. While good news for investors, it might not directly affect Amazon's stock unless there's a correlation, which isn't clear here.

Twitter 18 compares bond returns with inflation, but without seeing actual data, it's hard to assess the impact on Amazon's performance.

Tweet 19 is similar to tweet 17—another comparison of bond returns and inflation. No direct link, so neutral.

Tweet 20 is a direct question about whether prime day was a dud. Negative sentiment because it's an opinion without data support.

Twitter 21 mentions consumer discretionary ETFs celebrating Amazon's anniversary. Positive as it highlights the company's growth. So + votes here.

Twitter 22 talks about Janet Yellen's inflation talk and how Amazon's ""prime day"" relates to her comments. If this is a commentary on market sentiment influenced by Yellen, it could be neutral because I don't have data from there.

Twitter 23 repeats the same comment as tweet 22 but in different language.

Now, tallying up: several tweets are positive about Amazon's stock or related events, some negative like tweet 20 and 22. There's a mix of strong positive tweets and one neutral tweet (14) that gives $ amzn a spot on an iPhone site without direct link to performance.

Considering the overall sentiment, there are more positive tweets than negative ones. The mixedNeutral tweet might slightly lower the score but isn't enough to make it negative."
2015-07-16,Positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a given company. The user provided a list of tweets and a process to follow: first, identify the target stock symbol from each tweet, then analyze each one as positive or negative factors, assess sentiment towards investor mood, and finally determine if the overall impact is positive, neutral, or negative.

Hmm, okay. Let me go through each tweet step by step. 

1. The first tweet starts with ""$ twtr twitter inc URL $ kmi..."" Hmm, I'm not sure what the stock symbol here is because of the structure. It looks like it's part of a larger URL. Maybe it's ""Twtr"" or something else? But without knowing the exact stock name, it's hard to assess.

2. The second tweet mentions myec and other stocks like yhoo, nvda, lrcx, csco, etc. Again, not sure about the stock symbol here. This could be a distraction if I can't find the target.

3. The third tweet is more straightforward: ""amzn URL inc . summary URL $ amzn $ mdy $ bmo.to $ hou.to amzn nasdaq share."" So it seems like the target stock is AMZN, specifically the $ amzn share price.

4. The fourth tweet lists other stocks but doesn't specify a target symbol.

5. The fifth tweet has a subscription link for penny stocks. Not helpful for determining a stock name.

6. Similar to 2 and 3, mentions myec and others, not sure about the stock symbol.

7. "" $ amzn AT_USER at_user at_user at_user..."" Maybe it's a generic message about AMZN.

8. Lists MSFT, AMZN, HPQ, RAX, etc., but no target symbol here either.

9. Talks about Microsoft dealing with their own company, which might affect their stock price, so that could be positive or negative? Not sure yet.

10. Talks about mu and micron technology inc., which sounds tech-related. Maybe the stock is in the tech sector.

11. ""it's fuck'en never too late to buy nflx and amzn"" Seems like a disclaimer about buying shares, so maybe not impacting the price positively.

12. ""seal twitter en"" link to AMZN - maybe an unrelated message.

13. Talks about Amazon vs. Walmart, no target stock here.

14. A list of multiple tech stocks: TwTR, IntC, APM, GOGL, etc., but no specific company name is given. Could be a mix or perhaps it's the entire list.

15. ""netflix in 'middle inning' growth,"" mentions Apple hitting $150 by 2016 – that seems like positive news about growth and future price targets.

16. Talks about ETFs: ES, SPX, TSLA, etc., no stock name given.

Alright, so from this list, the target stock is either AMZN or another company without a symbol? Or maybe it's not clear. But the most clear one seems to be AMZN in several tweets.

Now, looking at each tweet:

1. I can't identify the target stock.
2. No target given.
3. Target is AMZN.
4. No target.
5. Subscopy link – no info on stock.
6. No target.
7. Not specific about a stock.
8. Multiple stocks listed without a target.
9. Tech company, possibly related to MSFT or others, but not specific.
10. Positive tech and future growth announcement.
11. Maybe unrelated.
12. Not specific.
13. Comparing companies – no target.
14. Multiple tech stocks without a company name.
15. Positive news about growth and future targets.
16. ETFs without a stock.

So, the only clear target seems to be AMZN in tweet 3, but that's just one tweet with multiple mentions. Without knowing which exact stock it refers to, it's hard to assess. However, considering that some tweets mention other tech stocks, maybe the overall sentiment is positive because of positive news about growth and potential future price targets.

Wait, tweet 15 talks about netflix and Apple reaching $150, which could be a positive signal for their stock prices. That seems like a good sign. Also, tweet 16 mentions ETFs but no specific company.

So, putting it all together, the tweets suggest some positive market outlook with potential future price targets. Therefore, the overall sentiment is likely Positive."
2015-07-17,Negative,"Okay, I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, let's identify the target stock. Looking at the tweets, some mention Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), and others like Microsoft (MSFT) or Alphabet Inc. (BA). Since not all are explicitly stated, I'll assume it could be one of these companies as their symbols are present.

Now, each tweet is a ""rt AT_USER"" followed by a URL hinting at the stock price. My goal is to analyze each tweet for factors and sentiment towards the target stock.

Looking at the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER why you need to own these 4 horsemen of tech : URL by AT_USER $ aapl $ fb $ googl $ amzn URL."" The user seems concerned about investing in these companies, which could be positive if they believe these stocks are undervalued or if the user is expressing interest.

Second tweet: ""if after hours is any indicator the big name tech stocks are going to kill it tomorrow ! ! $ nflx $ googl $ fb $ amzn $ a … URL."" This seems like a prediction or warning that tech stocks might not do well, so negative sentiment about potential downturns.

Third tweet: ""walmart sales surge countering amazon prime day sale URL $ amzn $ wmt."" While sales are up, Amazon's prime day is over, which is a bit of a blow for them. But overall, positive since some tech stocks are recovering, so mixed but leaning positive.

Fourth tweet: ""rt AT_USER orb trades - $ iwm $ spy $ qqq $ dia $ baba $ aapl $ fb $ twtr $ nflx $ googl $ tsla $ amzn $ bidu $ pcln $ lnkd - URL."" Multiple tech stocks are mentioned, including Apple and Amazon. The user is speculating about stock movements, which can be positive if they think the market is overbought.

Fifth tweet: ""omt puts when $ amzn was trading at $ 480 and $ 485 barely lost value . those put prices remained virtually the same with that $ 5 spike ."" This seems like a technical analysis, suggesting no significant price movement. Positive because it's about potential price levels, not actual trends.

Sixth tweet: ""rt AT_USER some of today's biggest tech movers : » $ googl » $ amzn » $ fb » $ lnkd » $ yhoo URL."" Again, multiple companies mentioned, indicating interest in tech stocks. If these are undervalued, positive sentiment; if overvalued, negative.

Seventh tweet: ""rt AT_USER few setups for friday URL other stocks to watch $ ge $ goog $ amzn $ splk $ rkus $ fcs $ alv $ tsla $ te $ isr …"" Similar pattern as the previous ones, multiple tech companies mentioned. Positive if market is optimistic about these.

Eighth tweet: ""rt AT_USER in ode to worldemojiday , some market highlights $ googl earnings were str 8 💰 $ amzn went to the 🌚 $ nflx looked like 💸 $ gld …"" Here, Apple and Amazon's earnings are mentioned with positive outcomes. Positive sentiment if their earnings are strong.

Ninth tweet: ""why you need to own the four horsemen of tech URL via AT_USER $ aapl $ googl $ fb $ amzn URL."" Similar to the first one, discussing stock ownership concerns but expressing interest in these companies. Could be neutral or slightly positive depending on the context.

Putting it all together, multiple tweets mention tech stocks and either predict their performance or indicate interest. However, some talk about potential issues like Amazon's prime day or Apple's earnings. Given that these are major tech companies with significant market impact, mixed sentiment seems likely, leaning towards a neutral response."
2015-07-18,Neutral,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided four tweets and wants to analyze their impact on a stock's future price. They want us to determine if it's Positive, Neutral, or Negative based on those tweets.

First, I need to figure out which tweet each one refers to as the target stock. Looking at the first tweet, the URL seems like a company identifier—$ intc is Intel. The second tweet has multiple companies listed: $ spy, $ qqq, etc., but that's more of a stock list, not a single stock.

Now, for the tweets, I'll separate each relevant one into positive and negative factors. For example, in tweet 1, all are positive mentions of the company—like ""mu micron technology inc URL intc"", which seems positive about Intel. Similarly, tweet 2 has several names: $ iwm (which is IBM), $ twtr (Twilio), etc., but again, it's more of a list.

Wait, but I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. The first tweet mentions ""mu micron technology inc"" and the other tweets also have URLs that might refer to other companies. This makes me confused because without identifying the correct stock, it's hard to assess its impact. Maybe there's an assumption here that all these tweets are about a specific stock, but it seems mixed up.

I think I need to make some assumptions. Since the first tweet is about ""mu micron technology inc"", which might be Intel, and the second tweet lists several companies like IBM, Twilio, etc., perhaps they're trying to collect information on multiple stocks? Or maybe each tweet is about a specific stock. But without clear context, it's challenging.

Assuming that ""mu micron technology inc"" refers to Intel (intc), I'll look at their tweets. The third tweet mentions ""amazon could soon be worth more than walmart"", which is positive for Amazon, the largest US tech company, so that would boost Intel's sentiment positively. The fourth tweet has a list but again, without context, it's hard to tell.

So, with this in mind, I'll consider each tweet as influencing Intel, maybe not all. The third tweet directly supports Intel, and the first two are possibly about other companies or unrelated. Therefore, overall, it seems there's some positive sentiment from one tweet."
2015-07-19,Neutral,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided four tweet symbols and each tweet seems to be about technology stocks or companies. I need to determine if each tweet is positive, negative, or neutral.

First, looking at tweet 1: It lists several stocks like mu micron tech inc, twtr, twtr again, etc. This could imply that the company is focusing on multiple products or services, which might suggest growth potential but not necessarily a direct positive or negative impact yet.

Next, tweet 2 has a lot of positive words like ""stling,"" ""amzn"" (Amazon), ""bsbr"" ( boola.com), and mentions of Google. Positive language usually indicates strong sentiment towards the company or its products, so this could be a sign of potential positive news.

Tweet 3 lists several tech companies like intc, aapl (Apple), googl (Google), ibm, fb, msft (Microsoft), amzn, etc. Similar to tweet 1, this might show the company's presence across various sectors but doesn't immediately indicate overall performance.

Finally, tweet 4 mentions ""espys"" and refers to the stock price of mu micron tech inc. The word ""espys"" is a brand name, which could be misleading. But the inclusion of ""twtr"" again suggests they're related to twtr, so perhaps there's some context or analysis around that company.

Now, considering each tweet in isolation: none of them alone speak directly about the stock price trend. They just provide information about different companies or mention their products. Therefore, without knowing more than one tweet at a time and its specific content, it's hard to determine the overall impact on the stock price. The user probably expects a summary after analyzing all four tweets together.

So, combining these, it seems like mu micron technology inc is involved in multiple tech stocks, but the main focus is on potential growth based on positive language. The brand espys might be misleading, but since they are related to twtr, which could imply some investment context. However, without a single tweet indicating an overall trend or analysis of the stock price itself, I can't assign it as positive, negative, or neutral.

I'm not entirely sure, maybe leaning towards neutral because while there's positive language suggesting growth, without specific data on performance, it's hard to say for certain."
2015-07-20,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price based on the given information.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking through the tweets, the main companies mentioned are Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA), and others like Google, IBM, and Microsoft Technology Inc (MTCN). 

Next, for each tweet, I have to separate positive and negative factors. For example, ""wall street analysts bullish on amzn's earnings growth"" is clearly a positive factor. However, another tweet mentions ""gdx market vectors gold miners prev close,"" which seems more like a negative factor because it relates to the stock of Goldx, but wait, actually Goldx isn't mentioned in any of the other tweets. Hmm.

I also need to assess the sentiment towards each factor. For instance, Analysts' bullish statements indicate positive emotions, while mentioning Goldx might be neutral or even slightly negative if there's uncertainty about its performance.

Looking at tweet 3: ""spxl direxion daily s & p 500 bull 3x shares summary URL $ spxl $ tmmi $ akba $ amzn spxl stocks invest."" This seems positive because it's promoting Amazon as a top U.S. clothing retailer and mentions investing in shares.

Similarly, tweet 7 talks about Amazon being eclipsed by Macy's but then says ""eclipsing macy's as top u . s . clothing retailer,"" which reinforces the positive view of Amazon's position.

Twitter trends like ""AT_USER upcoming earnings"" and ""today's top 5 technically ranked large cap stocks"" indicate investor interest, suggesting a positive trend.

Looking at other tweets, there are some that might be negative. For example, ""rt AT_USER $ gdx ... prev close URL."" It mentions Goldx but doesn't provide context on its performance, so it's neutral or slightly negative as investors don't have concrete info about it.

Considering all these factors—positive statements, investments in shares, mentions of competitors being top retailers—I think the overall sentiment is positive for Amazon. The company faces some minor issues like a recall and stock buybacks but has strong fundamentals, so overall, I'd say [Positive]."
2015-07-21,Positive,"Okay, I need to figure out the likely impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock symbol. From the tweets, it seems like ""amzn"" is consistently mentioned, so that's the stock in question: Amazon Inc. [AMZN]

Next, I'll analyze each tweet individually to break them down into factors and assess sentiment.

1. The first tweet talks about LinkedIn's URL and mentions AMZN as a potential replacement for Macy's by 2017. This is a positive sign because it's about expanding the company, which can boost sales. So, this is a Positive factor.

2. The second tweet suggests that Amazon will replace Macy's apparel in the US by 2017. That’s a strong positive note since it's an expansion and could attract more customers, leading to higher revenue. Positive again.

3. The third tweet talks about upcoming earnings on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. It mentions updates for IBM, MSFT, CMG, KO, GILD, SBUX, AMZN, etc. While the focus is on Amazon's earnings, it doesn't mention anything negative or positive related to Amazon itself yet. So, this might be a Neutral factor.

4. The fourth tweet provides a specific date for AMZN's Q2 2015 earnings report. This directly mentions the company and is a clear positive because it shows the company's performance in that quarter. Positive sentiment here.

5. The fifth tweet says the same as the fourth, just repeating the Q2 2015 details about Amazon's earnings. So, another Positive factor from the same source.

6. This tweet mentions millionaires and their stock prices. It doesn't touch on AMZN or any related information that would affect its performance. So, this is Neutral because it's not directly relevant to the stock in question.

7. The eighth tweet talks about swks skyworks solutions and their market cap. Again, no mention of AMZN or its performance, so this is a Neutral factor.

8. The ninth tweet focuses on $GEQ nearly quadrupling in less than two weeks with major news. This indicates strong potential for growth, which can boost the stock. Positive sentiment here.

9. The tenth tweet mentions that AMZN's stock has nearly quadrupled and highlights major news about it. This is a clear positive note due to the significant increase in value. Positive again.

10. The eleventh tweet talks about Amazon upgrading its mobile network for Android devices to get over the wall, similar to another company (Nflx). While this might affect Amazon's revenue or market share negatively if competitors gain market share, the overall impact is still positive because of the strategic move. So, Positive factor.

11. The twelfth tweet mentions that I’m targeting $GMW on AMZN and others in home services. No specific mention of AMZN performance, so this is Neutral.

13. The thirteenth tweet says that on July 20th, AMZN closed at $488.10 and the target is $600. This seems like a positive bet because it's a significant increase in price, which can influence investor sentiment positively. Positive.

14. The fourteenth tweet suggests that while the excitement around the chaos of the market might apply to AMZN, NFLX, and Facebook stocks. While this is speculative, it implies that these stocks are likely to perform well, adding to Amazon's confidence. Positive sentiment here.

15. The fifteenth tweet states that Amazon will replace Macy’s apparel in 2017. This is a positive sign because it can boost sales and attract new customers, which affects AMZN's revenue and future stock price. Positive factor.

Now, I'll summarize the factors:

- Positive: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15
- Neutral: 3, 6, 7, 12

I have a mix of positive and neutral factors. However, the majority are positive, which suggests that overall, these tweets are likely to positively influence Amazon's stock price."
2015-07-22,Positive,"Alright, so I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

Starting with the first tweet: ""rt AT_USER forget ' amazon $ 400 ' - the company is on the cusp of a huge milestone URL via AT_USER $ amzn $ wmt URL."" This seems pretty negative because it's discouraging Amazon from investing at $400 and mentions a big milestone. That sounds like a warning, so I'll mark this as negative.

Second tweet: ""am zn URL inc . 52wk high url $ am zn $ rdus $ dgaz $ td.to am zn invest finance."" The word ""inc"" here means increasing in value, which is positive news. It's talking about an increase and mentions investing, so the sentiment seems positive for Amazon.

Third tweet: ""dgld velocityshares 3x inverse gold etn 52wk low url $ dgld $ am zn $ clne $ elgx dgld investing stock."" The mention of a 3x inverse gold ETF seems like a long-term investment strategy. This is speculative and not directly related to Amazon, so it might be considered neutral because the information doesn't provide an immediate signal.

Fourth tweet: ""xly consumer discretionary select sector spdr summary url $ xly $ rsp $ retl $ am zn xly finance invest."" The word ""consumer discretionary"" could be positive if it's about choosing companies that can grow, but the focus here is on Amazon. It's part of a ETF and mentions investing in finance, so this seems positive.

Fifth tweet: ""sbux starbucks corp . bid size url $ sbux $ wfm $ inuv $ am zn sbux share tradeideas."" ""Starbucks"" is a competitor to Amazon, which could be both good and bad. If they are doing well, it's beneficial; if not, negative. But the tweet mentions their bid size and shares, which might indicate interest or stock price expectations. It doesn't say much about Amazon specifically.

Sixth tweet: ""am zn url inc . company info url $ am zn $ rdus $ dgaz $ td.to am zn invest finance."" Similar to the second tweet, ""inc"" means increasing in value. This is positive news for Amazon, which supports their stock performance.

Now, summarizing:
- Negative tweets: 1 and 3.
- Positive tweets: 2, 4, 6.
Neutral tweet: 5 (since it's speculative and not directly related to Amazon).

Since there are more positive tweets than negative ones, the overall sentiment seems positive. The supportive tweets outweigh the warnings, so the stock is likely going up."
2015-07-23,Positive,"Alright, let's break down how I approached solving this problem step by step.

First, I read through all 54 tweets and tried to identify the target stock symbol, which is Amazon (AMZN). The task was to analyze each tweet for factors that might affect Amazon's stock price and determine if it's going up, flat, or down.

Starting with tweet 1, it mentioned AT_USER $ amzn daily and paused due to earnings. I considered whether earnings could be a positive signal for AMZN. 

Looking at the subsequent tweets, many of them are talking about AMZN rising, especially in the next few days (tweets 2, 3, 54 onwards). These indicate that positive earnings reports can boost a stock price.

However, some tweets like tweet 7 and 18 mention Jeff Zaslow being richer or Amazon's financial performance. While these are interesting points, they don't necessarily provide strong evidence of AMZN's future performance. The main trend seems to be upwards movement in AMZN shares from the initial reports.

Considering all the positive developments and the fact that many subsequent tweets support AMZN's growth, I concluded that the overall sentiment is positive for Amazon."
2015-07-24,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze the given text and determine its overall sentiment. Let me start by reading through each paragraph carefully.

The first few paragraphs discuss Amazon's strong earnings for the past quarter, focusing on revenue growth in multiple areas like home delivery, e-commerce, cloud services, etc. It also highlights their presence in critical sectors like cloud storage, AR/VR, IoT, and artificial intelligence.

Looking ahead, the text mentions that Amazon is aiming to take its biggest gap in market share up by 21%, which suggests they're trying to compete more effectively in their competitive landscape. This positive aspect might indicate optimism about future growth.

However, not all sections are positive. There's a mention of potential risks due to data breaches and compliance challenges, which does add some negative points. But overall, the positive narrative is stronger with Amazon positioning itself better for expansion into new markets and leveraging technology to attract customers.

I should consider whether these positive trends outweigh the negative ones. While Amazon's strategic moves are beneficial, there are challenges they face in maintaining growth. So, it's a balanced view rather than just focusing on positives.

Therefore, I'll conclude with a neutral sentiment because while Amazon is doing well and has strategic advantages, there are also significant risks that could impact their performance."
2015-07-25,Negative,"Okay, so I have to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price and decide whether it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the tweets, they all mention ""amzn"" or some variation of it, so that's straightforward.

Now, for each tweet, I have to identify Positive and Negative factors. That means I'll break down what's being said as good (Positive) and bad (Negative). Then, assess the sentiment by evaluating how these factors influence investor confidence.

Let me go through them one by one:

1. $ amzn : URL price target increased to $650.00 by analysts at ... 
   - This seems like a positive action because they're raising the price target. So Positive.

2. rt AT_USER amazon web services is now a $6 billion-a-year monster , growing 80 % 
   - The mention of increasing revenue and the growth rate is definitely good. Also, it's about their value proposition. Positive.

3. nugt direxion daily gold miners bull 3x shares change URL $ nugt $ amzn $ upro $ agn nugt tradeideas stocks
   - This looks like a positive news because of the bull trend and increased shares. Positive.

4. rt AT_USER amazon rockets up more than 18 % on earnings beat $ amzn URL
   - High earnings growth is good; Amazon's stock went up. Positive.

5. amazon is now the highest valued company in retail on the face of the earth . $ amzn URL
   - High valuation and being top in a niche market. Good for investors. Positive.

6. rt AT_USER this is why i'm amazed at aws revenue for 2q15 . details 
   - The user seems to praise AWS but it's not directly about Amazon. Maybe neutral, because it's more of a side note without affecting Amazon's valuation.

7. slv ishares silver trust prev close URL $ slv $ abx $ amzn $ ajg slv invest finance
   - This looks like an analyst call that might affect Amazon. But the sentiment seems positive about their share recommendations. Positive.

8. long term portfolio sold all my $ amzn 100 shares from 362 $ out 579 $ my price target was 500 $ enjoyed the gap yesterday haha
   - Selling shares in a way that shows dissatisfaction. That's negative.

9. most popular tweets : $ amzn $ aapl $ fb $ biib $ twtr $ sbux $ nflx $ goog $ cat $ regn nasdaq nyse stocks trading tren … URL
   - This is about the stock market trends, but it's not directly about Amazon. It might be neutral.

10. fit fitbit , inc . summary URL $ fit $ amzn $ jpm $ akam fit invest stocks
    - Fitting into the tech space with FitBit and JPM. Positive because it's tech-related. Positive.

11. rt AT_USER starve a fever , feed a passion AT_USER u still standing ? props great week $ amzn $ lock AT_USER on fire $ itek URL
    - This seems like a joke or meme about the user feeling stressed but continuing to trade. Not sure if this directly affects Amazon's stock, so maybe neutral.

12. [ signaled twitter en ] $ amzn - URL URL
    - No clear sentiment here; just URLs and no action words. Neutral.

13. commodity clobbering continues as amazon lifts futures $ amzn URL
    - Positive because of increased futures prices. Positive.

14. $ amzn : bullish analyst action by b . riley on URL URL URL
    - The analyst is optimistic, which can be positive for Amazon. Positive.

15. ilmn illumina , inc . company info URL $ ilmn $ vti $ amzn $ mtdr ilmn share investing
    - This mentions a company (ILM) but doesn't directly talk about Amazon. Neutral because it's unrelated.

16. gdx market vectors gold miners last trade URL $ gdx $ gld $ amcx $ amzn gdx pennystocks finance
    - This is a side note about gold mining and GDX, not directly about Amazon. Neutral.

17. rt AT_USER wow ! : amazon is now bigger than walmart : URL $ amzn $ wmt URL
    - Comparing with Walmart can sometimes affect stock performance, but it's more of a lateral movement without strong reasoning. Positive.

Now, compiling all the sentiment:
- Positive tweets: 1,2,3,4,5,7,13,14,17.
- Negative tweet: 8.
- Neutral: 6,9,10,9, etc., but mostly neutral.

So, most positive, one negative, and the rest neutral. The overall sentiment seems to be mixed with some good moves and a couple of bad ones. It's not clear if it's overall positive or negative because there are both selling actions and buying actions."
2015-07-26,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for Amazon (AMZN). 

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the tweets, it seems like AMZN is the main focus here because multiple tweets mention it. So, I'll take that as my target stock.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one and analyze their factors and sentiment towards AMZN.

1. The first tweet mentions ""5 highest P/E ratios in the SPX are all up big in ' 15 lead by $ AMZN."" It sounds positive because it's talking about high P/E ratios and a strong position of Amazon, which usually boosts investor confidence. So this is a Positive factor.

2. The second tweet says, ""AMZN Top news - Jul 26th, 2015 ' AMZN URL."" This seems to be an event report around July 26th, 2015. Since it's specific and talking about the company's top story that happened in that year, I think this is a Neutral factor because while there was significant news, it might not directly impact Amazon's current stock price much.

3. The third tweet lists several stocks: $GBX, $LGH, $APla, $AMZN, $NTSLX, and $TSLA. This seems like a list of all the major companies related to AMZN that are being analyzed for their impact on Amazon. So these are multiple factors.

4. The fourth tweet says, ""after its first profitable quarter .. ' AMZN now has a P/E eps / share price = 984 VA."" A P/E ratio of 984 is exceptionally high and indicates good performance because lower P/E means higher valuation relative to earnings. So this is a Positive factor.

5. The fifth tweet mentions ""URL inc. ( Nasdaq: AMZN) rally in detail - live trading news | live ... ' AMZN URL."" Similar to the second tweet, it's discussing market news about AMZN and its stock performance. This would be considered Neutral because while there was some movement, it might not directly influence current sentiment.

Now, I'll assess each factor:

- Positive factors: 1, 4.
- Neutral factors: 2, 3, 5.
- Negative factors: There are no negative points identified here.

For overall sentiment, since we have a mix of positive and neutral factors, it's hard to determine a clear overall trend. But considering the high P/E ratio in AMZN (984), which is quite low compared to historical averages, this might indicate strong valuation and a potential positive impact on stock price.

However, with other positive factors like the SPX up 15% and some growth stocks, it's possible that while there are mixed signals, the overall sentiment leans slightly towards a Positive outcome because of the significant performance metrics."
2015-07-27,Positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price and determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions that Amazon is ""last one out"" with something they're doing. That seems like a common tactic in stocks where companies wait for others to dip below their target prices before making a move. So, this looks like a positive signal because it's about the company's timing strategy.

2. The second tweet talks about sentiment analysis for Sentiquant and mentions things related to fintech, which is a broad area but could be related to Amazon or other companies in tech. While it's not directly from Amazon, it might indicate some market reaction that could affect stock prices, so it adds some positivity.

3. Third tweet discusses American Depositary Receipts for Amazon, Google, Apple, Facebook, Netflix, and Gildong. These are all big tech companies, which are often correlated with Amazon. If these stocks perform well, it could boost Amazon's value. This seems like a positive factor.

4. Fourth tweet talks about the open interest before the 7/31 expiration of Amazon's stock. Open interest is a measure of how active a stock is in the market, so higher numbers might indicate more interest or activity, which sometimes affects stock prices. So this adds to the positive sentiment because it suggests ongoing trading volume.

5. Fifth tweet mentions that Amazon's Q2 results showed an ""at astounding slide."" If there was a big drop in their profits, that could be seen as bad news for Amazon, but since it's from AT_USER, it might not directly relate unless they're related to the stock. It's unclear without more context.

6. Sixth tweet talks about Google and Amazon losing 60 points in earnings. If this is true, it would indicate a strong performance that could drive prices up, so positive sentiment here.

7. Seventh tweet discusses kernelsan for their focus groups. This could affect Amazon's stock price if the company conducts research that might positively impact their products or services, which isn't directly tied to Amazon but could indirectly influence them.

8. Eighth tweet mentions ISHARES and Silver as a topic. Silver is a precious metal, so it could be related to other industries, not necessarily stock prices unless Silver ETFs are involved. This seems too vague for direct impact.

9. Ninth tweet talks about the ""sex toys"" analyst call. Not directly related to Amazon, so this might just be another unrelated tweet with no clear effect on Amazon's stock price.

10. Tenth tweet says China news affects the market, but since the tweet doesn't specify how or when, it's hard to assess.

11. Eleventh tweet is about an analyst asking a question on sex toys in an Amazon earnings call. Again, not related to Amazon's stock.

12. Twelfth tweet mentions TSLA and other companies like BABA, which isn't directly tied to Amazon.

So, breaking it down:

- Positive tweets: 1, 3, 4, 6
- Neutral or Indeterminate: 5,7,8,9,10,11,12

Most of them are positive. The big drop in Q2 for Amazon (tweet 5) is a bit uncertain because it's not directly from the stock, but if there was an actual decline, that would be negative. However, without knowing the outcome, I can't say for sure. The other tweets have more direct mentions or implications.

Given the majority of positive points and one with uncertainty (tweet 5), I think the overall sentiment is Positive. It's not a huge negative but there are some signs pointing to potential negative news."
2015-07-28,Negative,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of Netflix. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol. The tweets include names like $ nflx, which is a common symbol for Netflix. So, the target stock is Netflix.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one. Each tweet has an arrow pointing towards a stock or something related. For example, "" NFLx netflix URL baba"" suggests that the user is looking at other stocks but hasn't found any on the left side of the screen. 

Looking at the first tweet: ""$ nflx netflix URL $ baba"". The main thing here is $ nflx, which is Netflix. There are mentions of baba and twtr too, but those might be irrelevant since they aren't related to Netflix.

Moving on to the second tweet: ""$aapl $ fb $ twtr $ nflx $ googl $ tsla $ amzn $ pcln wheat $ vrx.to $ vltc $ rgbp ylena $ goog $ nflx"". This one looks more like it's pulling in other stocks, but again, I'm not sure how that relates to Netflix. It has a lot of stock ticker symbols, which might indicate investor interest in those companies.

Third tweet: ""$apl"" isn't a stock symbol for Netflix, so maybe this is a typo or irrelevant. Then ""$pcln wheat"", which might be referring to a different company. The rest are just other stocks that the user is looking at. I can't see how this ties into Netflix.

Fourth tweet: ""$vrx.to $ vltc $ rgbp ylena $ goog $ nflx"". Similar to the second one, this seems like it's pulling in other stocks but not directly related to Netflix.

Fifth tweet: ""$goog"" again is a stock symbol for Google. The rest are other companies that the user might be interested in, perhaps via their Twitter feed. But no mention of Netflix here either.

Sixth tweet: ""$nflx"" which is Netflix. This seems straightforward; it's just pulling out Netflix from the tweets. It doesn't mention any other stocks. 

Seventh tweet: ""$amzn $ pcln wheat $ rgbp ylena $ goog $ nflx"". Again, this is focusing on other companies, not Netflix.

Eighth tweet: ""$cls"" which might be a typo or irrelevant. Then it lists some other stocks that the user might have noticed. No mention of Netflix here either.

Looking at all these tweets, most of them are pulling out other stock symbols but none specifically mention or relate to Netflix. The main tweet is just ""nflx"", which is Netflix itself. 

So, considering that only one tweet mentions Netflix and others pull in other stocks, it seems like there's no direct information affecting Netflix's price. It's possible the user might be doing a stock market analysis on their own or checking out other companies.

Since none of these tweets provide any positive, negative, or neutral sentiment related to Netflix, I should consider that the overall impact is neutral because there isn't enough information to determine if the stock is going up, down, or staying the same."
2015-07-29,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price based on the given guidelines. Let me start by understanding what each step entails.

First, for each tweet, I have to identify if it has positive or negative factors. Then, assess the sentiment towards the overall company and combine that to decide [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

Looking at the first tweet: ""rt bosocial : toptickertweets $ twtr $ fb $ aapl $ spy $ gild $ yelp $ tsla $ goog $ uwti $ amzn sentiquant fintech 201507 … URL"". It mentions several companies, including Amazon, with some terms like 'fintech.' That sounds tech-related, but I'm not sure if that's positive or negative. Maybe neutral since it could go either way.

The second tweet is ""rt AT_USER 1997 $ amzn shareholder letter - it's all about the long term URL intelligentfanatic URL"". It seems to express optimism about the future of Amazon and mentions being a long-term investor. That suggests positive sentiment because it talks about the company in the long run.

Third tweet: ""$ amzn news : "" amazon to partner with startups $ am zn start up $ mo $ lng $ amt $ mnst investors read URL"". Here, they're talking about partnerships with startups and employees reading letters. This seems positive as it's about growth opportunities for Amazon's future.

Fourth tweet: ""$ ocls break out up 10 % today . price target of $ 5 $ amzn $ twx $ mo $ lng $ amt $ mnst investors read URL"". This mentions a price target increase and employees reading letters. It sounds like a call to action, possibly signaling optimism about the stock.

Fifth tweet: ""$ amzn $ goog $ aapl $ fb $ ntfx $ gild accounts for more than half of $ 664billion in value added this year to the $ nasdaq"". This is talking about their contribution to the NASDAQ. More than half could imply that they're contributing positively, which might be seen as positive.

Lastly, the sixth tweet: ""AT_USER $ amzn ground rules ? amazon lays out sky rules URL"". It's a question, but it seems to be setting expectations or outlining guidelines for Amazon. That's neutral since it's not about the stock's performance but more about something else.

Now, evaluating each tweet:

1. Neutral - tech-related term
2. Positive - long-term outlook and investor sentiment
3. Positive - partnership opportunities and employee engagement
4. Positive - price target increase and employee action
5. Positive - contributing to NASDAQ positively
6. Neutral - outlining guidelines

Adding up the positive influences: tweets 2, 3, 4, and 5 contribute positively. But tweet 1 is neutral on tech terms. So overall sentiment is positive."
2015-07-30,Positive,"Alright, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine their likely impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at each tweet individually might be overwhelming because there are 15 of them. But since the output only requires a single line deciding overall sentiment, maybe I can summarize each tweet and then aggregate.

Starting with tweet 1: It mentions ""amzn URL inc . stock message board URL $ amzn $ mcd $ hznp $ dyax amzn investing invest."" Hmm, not much here. Maybe just noting that Amazon is involved in investments but nothing conclusive about their financials or trends.

Tweet 2 and 3 seem to be related to AMZN's performance: ""dxj wisdom tree japan hedged equity ex-div date URL $ dxj $ tvix $ voo $ amzn ..."". Not much here, just about hedge strategies. Maybe not directly affecting stock price.

Tweet 4 talks about trade pros and investing in NFLX and AMZ with a focus on the NASDAQ. This seems positive because it's about diversification and potential gains, which could be a good sign for investor confidence.

Tweets 5 and 6 repeat the same thing as tweet 4, just emphasizing that Amazon is paying $250M to bring in the top gear trio for a new show. That's significant; this might indicate some strategic decision affecting future earnings.

Tweet 7 mentions launch of a car series on Amazon Prime via former topgear hosts. This could signal a new product line or expansion, which might boost Amazon's revenue and thus stock price.

Tweet 8 talks about voltage and other stocks, but no direct mention of AMZN performance. Could be unrelated or speculative.

Tweets 9 to 14 talk about various hedge positions on NFLX, TSLA, AMZN, FB. The mention of a $250M payment for top gear trio is significant, which might indicate a strategic acquisition or dividend payout that Amazon could benefit from.

Tweet 11 mentions HZNP stock performance but no action taken. Not much here.

Tweets 12 to 14 discuss other companies, including NTE and TBT, so not relevant to AMZN's stock directly.

Overall, the tweets seem to focus on strategic moves or potential earnings announcements related to Amazon (AMZN), which could indicate a positive signal for investors. The emphasis on diversification strategies (tweets 4 and 5) suggests AMZN is looking ahead for growth opportunities, which might be seen as a positive indicator for future stock price.

But there are some speculative tweets about other companies (tweets 8, 10-13), but I don't have direct information about how those would affect AMZN. The main positives seem to stem from the strategic moves related to Amazon's own performance, which could drive investor confidence."
2015-07-31,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze the given tweets to determine their likely impact on the future stock price of a company. The user has provided 10 tweets and an output requirement where the conclusion must be either [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, I should identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking through the tweets, the most common stock mentioned is ""amzn"" throughout multiple tweets. So, I'll focus on this company.

Next, I need to parse each tweet for factors that influence investor sentiment—Positive and Negative factors. Each tweet provides information about potential investments, news related to amzn, or other companies. 

Let's go through each tweet one by one:

1. ""Our penny stock picks have gained 3,600% in 10 months! Get early access to our next pick: URL $amzn$qcom$csco""

- Positive factors: Mention of stock gains and upcoming access.
- Negative factors: No obvious negatives mentioned here.

2. ""Hyg ishares iboxx high yield corporate bond fund eod data URL hyg amzn xon ffiv""

- Positive factors: High-yield bonds, stock performance (hyg), but no negative info here.

3. ""$ googl google URL greferendum dyax hban gt dhiisco bk b aapl nflx woof pzza swks fb ctas oslh amzn""

- Positive factors: Investment opportunities with Google and various tech companies.
- Negative factors: No negatives mentioned here.

4. ""% change url nem abc amzn ewg nem stock stockmarketnflx netflix inc summary.""

- Positive factor: News about newmont mining, but also mentions a stock market analysis, which might indicate general market conditions, not directly about amzn.

5. Same as tweet 4 with the same URL and content.

6. Same as tweets 3,4,5,6 with similar URLs.

7. ""Nem newmont mining corp. % change url $nem abc amzn ewg nem stock stockmarket nflx netflix inc summary.""

- Positive factors: News about newmont's performance but again, general market analysis.

8. ""Interactive chart -> URL amzn research and development is rising. URL""

- Positive factor: Information suggesting ongoing developments in amzn's R&D.
- Negative factor: No clear negative mentioned here.

9. ""$ c citigroup, inc. news url $c am zn g o biib c investing investing.""

- Positive factors: News about citigroup, which could affect the stock market indirectly, but no direct mention of amzn.
- Negative factors: No negatives here.

10. ""Amzn URL inc. p/e ratio url $amzn dd smn qcom amzn finance invest""

- Positive factor: P/E ratio mentioned, but it's unclear how this affects amzn's stock directly.

Now, compiling the sentiment:

- Positive factors for amzn include gains in other stocks (like qcom, csco, googl), news about newmont's R&D, and general market analysis.
- Negative factors are minimal; most tweets mention positive aspects without clear negatives.

Considering all this, there isn't a strong indication of a downward trend. The company is receiving positive updates from other sectors but the overall message seems positive overall.

Thus, I'll conclude that the stock has a [Positive] sentiment based on the presence of positive factors and minimal negative indicators."
2015-08-01,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to determine the impact on the stock price based on the given tweets. So, I have two tweets here, and I need to analyze each one step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbols in the tweets: The first tweet mentions NKE, which is NVIDIA, and the second one is AMZN, which stands for Amazon. That's helpful because these are well-known companies with significant stock prices. 

Now, let me go through each tweet. The first one says ""rt AT_USER amazon revealed plans for how it anticipates its drones would operate in airspace : URL $ amzn url"". It looks like the user is mentioning Amazon (AMZN) and talking about their drone plans being discussed or planned. The mention of drones is interesting because I know NVIDIA has done some work with drones, especially in areas like autonomous vehicles and delivery. But how does that affect a stock price? If companies are collaborating on new technologies like drones, it can lead to potential advancements which might boost the stock price. So, considering all this, there seems to be a positive implication here.

The second tweet is ""nke nike inc . last price URL $ nke $ amzn $ aapl $ regn nke investing finance"". It's just repeating the target symbols and their stock codes. While this doesn't contain any explicit or implied information about the company, it's likely meant to inform the reader that I'm analyzing these tweets. From what I gather, there’s no positive or negative sentiment here—just a repeat of the target symbols. So, in terms of impact, this tweet seems neutral because it's not providing any meaningful content.

Now, combining both tweets. The first one is positive regarding Amazon's drone plans, which could potentially drive up their stock price. The second tweet is just reiterating the target symbols without adding any new information. Therefore, while the first tweet has a positive impact on the overall company's value, the second tweet doesn't add anything significant.

So, putting it all together, I should assess that the main positive factor is from the first tweet, but the other tweet isn't contributing enough to outweigh that. The stock price is likely going to rise because of the drone plans from Amazon, making the overall sentiment positive."
2015-08-02,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First tweet is about $vxx short sales. It mentions updating short sales on August 2nd, so that could affect investor sentiment positively since it might signal more buying or shorting activities.

Second tweet talks about Amazon Inc. and mentions some stocks like GG, ISIS, etc., but there are no clear positive or negative words here; it's more of a news feed update.

Third tweet lists several symbols: SHAK, SHACKLE, etc., including HPQ, ORCL, PCLN, JPM, BABA, AALP, FB, TWTR, NFLX, GOOG, TSLA, AMZN, PRTX, Fold, Scmp, Fv. I can see names like APPL and FB which are significant to Amazon. The mention of GOOGL might suggest some positive info, but not sure about the impact yet.

Fourth tweet mentions IBB stock message board, updates on Saturate, and talks about investing. No obvious positives or negatives here except the potential for investor interest from new information.

Fifth tweet is about the U.S. Post Office delivering to Amazon, just a minor point with no positive indicators related to stock price.

Sixth tweet mentions company info, GSPC, googl, phm, etc., but again, nothing specific that would affect stock performance.

So overall, the tweets mention significant symbols like GOOGL and APPL, which are major in the tech sector. The most notable is APPL, which could indicate positive news about Amazon's growth or strategic initiatives. However, without specific positive keywords from these tweets, it's hard to tell if it's a strong positive or just minor information.

Putting it all together, I think there's some potential for Amazon to improve their stock based on the signs of big tech companies but it's still uncertain."
2015-08-03,Negative,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to figure out if they're positive, negative, or neutral towards the stock price. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

Starting with tweet 1: It mentions several stocks and an URL for a chart. Not much context here, just general information. So probably not strongly affecting investor sentiment.

Tweet 2 talks about Alibaba taking on AWS for $1 billion. That's a large sum, but it says they're working against Amazon. I'm not sure how that affects investors yet; it might be more of a long-term strategic move rather than immediate news.

Tweet 3 is about SPXU (S&P 500 ultra) changing with other stocks. It's about an index change due to a new stock, but without specifics on what happened, it's hard to tell the sentiment.

Tweet 4 discusses Shak shake and shack inc., their yield, dividend, and other factors. The mention of financial stuff might indicate some concern, especially regarding dividends and yield, which could be negative for investors expecting stable returns.

Tweet 5 is about XLU utilities in an S&P 500 context. Not much specific info here; just a stock within that index.

Tweet 6 lists a bunch of stocks from multiple companies. It says the market trendin and goes into details. The inclusion of ""now"" might suggest a possible shift, but without specifics, it's unclear if there's positive or negative news yet.

Tweet 7 talks about top stocks to buy in August, mentioning several tech companies. This is speculative but could hint at potential growth, which would lean towards positive.

Tweet 8 mentions Amazon going up despite the broader market down. That seems like a direct and significant effect—positive news for Amazon's performance.

Tweet 9 is about Shak shake inc., yielding and having finance stock market info. The focus here is on their financials rather than stocks, which might indicate some positive news related to their business.

Tweet 10 discusses the weekend review video for the spy (Alphabet) index. If the video has positive or negative content, it could influence sentiment. Not sure about the specifics without watching it.

Tweet 11 talks about an S&P 500 index futures changing after equities rally. The fact that futures are little changed might indicate uncertainty but not immediate info on how that affects stocks.

Putting this all together: There's a mix of speculative information (tweets 7 and 9) suggesting positive trends, some news about stock performance (tweets 8 and 10), and speculative market updates. However, none of the tweets provide concrete, significant data or expert opinions. So it's hard to determine an overall trend yet."
2015-08-04,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to determine the impact on the stock price based on these tweets. The user provided four tweets and asked for an analysis to decide if it's Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

First, I'll go through each tweet one by one. 

1. ""platinum subscribers saw our picks gain 4,000 % in 10 months ! subscribe today : URL $ amzn $ qcom $ csco"". Hmm, this seems to be a sale offer for certain stocks. The user is offering subscriptions and promises gains over 4000%. It's promotional but doesn't mention anything negative or positive about the stocks. So, I'm leaning towards this tweet being neutral because it's not providing any information that would sway investor sentiment in either direction.

2. ""most popular tweets : $ aapl $ twtr $ fb $ dis $ goog $ nflx $ amzn $ lxrx $ tsla $ gs nasdaq nyse stocks trading trendi … URL"". This tweet is pretty generic, mentioning popular stocks and trends. It's not giving any specific information about the stock performance. Since it's just general, I think this tweet could be seen as neutral because there's no indication of positive or negative factors influencing its price.

3. ""$ k $ dis $ aet $ aapl $ amzn $ googl $ car $ aa : u . s . index futures little changed before kellogg , disney results : URL"". This one talks about future trends and specific companies. It mentions stock futures and results but doesn't provide any updates or positive/negative indicators. It's more of an informational tweet without actionable data. So, similar to the first two tweets, I think this is also neutral because it doesn't give direct information about price movements.

4. ""our penny stock picks have gained 3,600 % in 10 months ! check out today's new pick : URL $ amzn $ mcox $ goog"". This seems similar to the first tweet but with different stocks. It's a promotional offer for specific companies. Again, it doesn't mention any positive or negative information about their performance. The fact that it offers a subscription service might be seen as a way to attract investors, which could make it seem neutral since it's more about attracting rather than predicting price changes.

Putting it all together, each tweet is either promotional without info, generic, or informational with no data. Since none of them provide positive or negative information about the stock performance, I'm leaning towards a neutral overall sentiment. They're not making a direct claim that would tip the scale in one direction."
2015-08-05,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. I'll go through each tweet step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. It seems like all the tweets mention AMZN or similar companies. So my main focus is on those tweets that specifically mention AMZN.

Looking at the first tweet: ""AT_USER inc . ( $ amzn ) rising quickly ! currently priced at 537.96 . URL"". This one mentions AMZN but doesn't provide much detail about why it's rising or not, so I'll note this as neutral because there's no clear sentiment.

Next tweet: ""rt AT_USER world's fastes growing companies $ fb $ amzn $ dis $ tm $ ebay $ sbux $ sne URL URL"". Again, mentions AMZN but doesn't specify if the company is performing well. It also lists several other stocks, so again, neutral since there's no specific info on AMZN.

Third tweet: ""rt AT_USER internet giants , 2015 winners & losers URL $ nflx $ fb $ googl $ amzn $ ebay $ yhoo $ twtr $ lnkd stocks URL"". This one is talking about multiple companies, including AMZN. It doesn't provide any information about AMZN's performance here either, so it remains neutral.

Fourth tweet: "" $ shak shake shack URL $ kmi $ wmt $ cemp $ nat kmi pennystocks $ myec $ sgyp $ aria $ nvax myec $ fb $ nflx $ amzn $ jblu $ cemex"". Again, mentions AMZN. The text is quite detailed and seems to discuss different sectors or products, but the main focus on AMZN isn't there. So it's still neutral.

Fifth tweet: "" $ amzn , market up ( $ qqq ) up more than 1.38 % and amazon is under performing peers like blah at . 96 % , while $ googl 2 . … URL"". This one specifically mentions AMZN, so I should look into its performance here. The tweet says it's up by over 1.38%, which seems positive. It also points out that Amazon is underperforming compared to peers like Google, which is a negative point. However, the overall movement of AMZN is an increase, even though there are other factors. I need to consider if this makes the stock more or less likely to rise.

Putting it all together: The main tweet mentions AMZN but talks about its market performance and competition. Since the main positive factor (AMZN up) outweighs the negative comparison with peers, the overall sentiment seems positive for Amazon's stock."
2015-08-06,Negative,"Alright, let's break down how I approached this task. First, I need to understand what was asked. The user provided several tweets and wants me to determine if each affects the stock price of a given company by putting it into one of three categories: Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

I started by looking at the target stock symbol from the context. Since the output needs to conclude with just one tag, I assumed that the stocks mentioned in these tweets are all for the same company. From the tweets, I saw several mentions like AMZN, GOOGL, TSLA, FB, etc., which are all known Apple Inc. shares.

Next, I went through each tweet one by one. For each tweet, I had to identify positive and negative factors. Positive factors might include something encouraging investors about future performance, while negatives could be bad news affecting their expectations.

Looking at the first tweet, it mentioned an update on $vrx financials but then diverged into unrelated stocks like APPL and CZR. Since the main target stock was AMZN, I focused on that. It didn't directly mention anything positive or negative related to AMZN except for a reference URL which I ignored.

The second tweet also included several other stocks but again, without specific info about AMZN, it's hard to assess the sentiment. The third tweet mentioned CSX and GRS, which don't relate to AMZN.

The fourth tweet called out AMZN below 529, which is a bearish indicator of potential sell pressure. This directly mentions a target stock price, so I noted that as negative impact.

The fifth tweet compared AMZN to GOOGL, suggesting a similar outlook but didn't mention the specific price, just an expectation boost. So, not too strong for positive.

After analyzing each tweet, I concluded that the main bearish indicator was the low price target for AMZN. This leads me to categorize it as [Negative]."
2015-08-07,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price by analyzing them. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, the user provided a list of tweets with various topics. My task is to identify the stock symbol in each tweet because that's essential for identifying which company we're talking about. 

Looking at the tweets:

1. The first tweet mentions ""amzn URL inc . % change URL $ amzn $ sbux $ hznp $ blcm amzn stock investing"". So, the stock symbol here is AMZN.

2. The second tweet starts with a projection for usdjpy monthly chart and discusses various exchanges. It mentions companies likegoogl, fb, etc., but doesn't directly mention Amazon.

3. The third tweet talks about USD/CAD 1-hour charts and other tech stocks. Again, no mention of AMZN.

4. A tweet from ""tsla"" with info on ge and hdm. So, Tesla is the stock here.

5. This tweet mentions AT_USER media earnings disappointing on August 6th, 2015, referring to NFLX. Not related to Amazon.

6. Discusses investing in large-cap tech stocks for income. Again, not AMZN.

7. Talks about a lateral setup with TwTR. No mention of AMZN here.

8. Refers to LinkedIn stock info and investor opinions on LNK. Not relevant.

9. Suggests not shorting XOM (XOM). Unrelated.

10. Discusses XOM's stock posts on FB. Not related.

11. Talks about TwTR as an advertising platform with lateral setup. No mention of AMZN.

12. Discusses Google's Inc. and other companies, but no AMZN info.

13. Refers to QQQ Fund ultra fund holdings, NASDAQ stock. Again, not Amazon.

After reviewing all the tweets, it seems only three specific stocks are mentioned: AMZN (first tweet), Tesla (fourth tweet), and XOM (ninth tweet). The other tweets are either discussing different companies or unrelated topics.

Since none of these tweets specifically mention AMZN's performance relative to other stocks or changes in its stock price, it's hard to gauge the impact on Amazon. Without specific sentiment analysis like positive/negative messages about AMZN's stock movement, I can't determine if the overall sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

So, based on this information, there isn't enough data provided to conclude whether these tweets positively, neutrally, or negatively affect Amazon's stock price."
2015-08-08,Positive,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a given company. The user provided a list of 7 tweets and wants me to decide if each is positive, neutral, or negative. Then, based on that analysis, they want a single conclusion about the stock's sentiment.

First, I need to figure out what each tweet is saying. Let me go through them one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions three large-cap tech stocks for income and lists some URLs. It doesn't seem like it's making any predictions or stating that something bad will happen. So probably a neutral or negative opinion.
2. The second tweet repeats the same structure as the first, just using different words. Still no clear message about future stock performance. Neutral seems likely here too.
3. Similar to the first two tweets, this one also just lists stocks and URLs. No positive language suggesting something good will happen. So another negative or neutral opinion.
4. The fourth tweet mentions gdx market vectors, gold miners, financials, and tech stocks. It includes some stock symbols like gdx, amzn, eem, mrk. But it's not providing any specific predictions about the stock price. It might be neutral or slightly positive if there are related factors.
5. The fifth tweet is a repeat of the first one, just listing more stocks and URLs without any comments. So same as before, probably negative or neutral.
6. The sixth tweet talks about RT's user actions—like financials, big tech, gold miners falling down. It mentions only two other stocks haven't fallen. So this seems like a positive signal because there are still some gains expected. Maybe the stock is undervalued here.
7. Similar to the fifth and first tweets, just listing more stocks and URLs without any sentiment or predictions.

Now, let's evaluate each one:

1. Negative (N)
2. Negative (N)
3. Negative (N)
4. Neutral (R)
5. Negative (N)
6. Positive (P) because it mentions that some big tech companies are on the upswing.
7. Negative (N)

Adding them up: 0 positives, 5 negatives, and 1 neutral. But wait, I only considered the positive in tweet 6 as a single point. Is there more to it? If tweet 6 is indicating that two other stocks haven't fallen, does that mean the stock is expected to stay or increase? Maybe slightly positive.

So maybe tweet 6 adds one positive point and the rest are negative. That would give me 1 positive, 5 negatives, totaling -3 overall. But since there's a significant event here about some big tech stocks being strong, it might tip it positively. So I'm leaning towards [Positive] now."
2015-08-09,Neutral,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided several tweets and wants me to analyze their impact on the stock price of a company. They've given a set of instructions: extract the target stock symbol from each tweet, assess positive or negative factors in each, determine the sentiment of each tweet towards that stock, and then conclude with ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"". 

First, looking at the tweets, they all seem to be about the price of $ngcg peanuts arriving. Each one has a URL that probably refers to AMZN (Amazon), which is a well-known stock. So, my target stock symbol here should be AMC since that's the ticker for Amazon.

Next, I need to parse each tweet individually. However, all four tweets are identical in content: they mention $ngcg peanuts arriving and the URL pointing to AMZN. This repetition suggests that each tweet might have similar sentiment indicators but is about the same stock.

Now, for each tweet, I should identify Positive and Negative factors. But since all tweets are the same, I can infer that the sentiment isn't changing. They're just multiple copies of a single message. So, each tweet's content doesn't provide new information or indicate a different outlook on the stock.

Given that all four tweets have the same content, the analysis is redundant and doesn't offer any unique insights. It's as if every tweet is pointing towards the same conclusion about Amazon's performance in relation to $ngcg peanuts arriving.

Since there's no variation in sentiment or factors across the tweets, I can't determine a single overall sentiment. Each tweet merely repeats the same information, so it's impossible to assess whether they're positive, neutral, or negative for the stock price impact.

Therefore, without any unique data points from these tweets, the conclusion should be that there's no clear indication of how these tweets affect the stock. The response should reflect that as none are providing a different perspective or outcome."
2015-08-10,Positive,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided a list of 34 tweets, and each seems to be about stock performance or market news. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I notice that some tweets have URLs with stock symbols like $amzn, $g ngcg, etc. Others include hashtags and mention companies like Muchomacho, Amazon,ety, and others. My task is to identify the factors (positive or negative) from each tweet and then assess sentiment overall.

Starting with tweets 1-4: They all have the same URL structure but varying details. Each mentions $amzn, which is a significant stock. These seem like confirmations of stock performance. They probably don't add much sentiment beyond confirming current news, so maybe minimal positive or neutral impact.

Tweets 5-8 are similar to the first four, just repeating the URLs with slight variations in content. Same here; no clear sentiment indicators except for possible minor buzzwords, which might be considered as a few positives without major shifts.

From tweet 9 onwards: These tweets mention companies like $g ngcg, including some names I recognize, like muchomacho, amzn, etc. The last tweet mentions spdr s&p 500 etf trust and other ETFs, which could be sentiment indicators for the S&P 500. The fact that these are related to major sectors like cloud computing and tech makes me think they're likely positive about market performance.

Looking at tweets 9-13: They all start with $ ngcg peanuts arriving and then link it to amzn or baba, which is a company name for a financial services provider. This suggests a bullish trend from the tweet itself.

Tweets 14-20 are mentions of ETFs related to the S&P 500. These could be positive signals about economic growth or sector performance, but I'm not entirely sure if they indicate overall market movement yet.

From tweets 21 onwards: Most mention different companies like nflx, aapl, googl, bidu, etc., which are all tech or financial stocks. The fact that many tweets from 23 onward have links to big tech companies like alibaba and baba might be pointing towards positive news about the market.

However, I also notice some tweets mention specific hashtags like ""longer life"" linked to a company, which could imply investor confidence or positive outlook for their stock. But without more context, it's hard to say if this is neutral or negative.

Looking at tweet 27: It mentions Alibaba's plans for a $1 billion cloud computing push. Alibaba is a major tech and financial company with strong growth potential. A positive news about their future could be seen as a positive indicator of the market.

Similarly, tweet 31 suggests that spicy food has a longer life, which might indicate that consumers are more willing to try new things, potentially affecting stock performance positively. But again, without direct market data, it's speculative.

Tweets from 32 onwards all mention amzn and baba, which could be signals of positive news about the company or sector trends. The presence of multiple tweets on these companies suggests a consistent positive sentiment.

Considering all the positives from these tweets—mentioning major tech companies like alibaba and baba with specific future plans, ETFs for S&P 500, and links to new product launches—it's likely that the overall sentiment is positive. However, it's also important to consider that some tweet structures might be just confirming recent news without leading towards a larger trend.

I'm leaning toward a Positive overall sentiment because there are multiple tweets pointing towards positive developments from tech companies with significant impact on stock markets. But I should also mention any potential minor negative signals in other tweets, but they seem overshadowed by the positives.

Therefore, my conclusion is that the company's overall sentiment is positive based on the numerous positive tweets related to tech companies and major sectors."
2015-08-11,Negative,"Okay, so I need to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price based on the given options: Positive, Neutral, or Negative. Let me start by going through each tweet one by one.

The first tweet mentions ""AT_USER $ ngcg peanuts have arrived"" and URLs related to AMZN. It says they're getting closer to a deal. That seems positive because it's talking about a potential move in the stock price. So that's a positive sign.

Looking at tweets 3 and 4, similar phrases are repeated: ""rt AT_USER $ ngcg peanuts have arrived ! getyourstoday ! URL muchomacho michelada $ amzn ngcg otc . URL"" which is the same as tweet 1. It's just rephrased a bit, but it clearly mentions the move towards AMZN. That reinforces that positive sentiment.

Now, tweet 5 says ""AT_USER $ amzn next,"" which indicates Amazon is on the rise and might come up next. That definitely makes me think of a potential increase in price, so another positive sign.

Tweets 6 to 14 are about stock prices: SPX, Aapl, Gpro, etc. These are likely indicators of broader market performance. But without knowing if these companies' prices are rising or falling, it's hard to assess the impact on AMZN. The user is asking for a conclusion based on these tweets alone.

Looking at tweet 12, there are several stock names mentioned: QQQ, HFT, ALGOS, etc., triggering a sell in several platforms. This suggests that others might be selling their shares, which can affect the stock price, but it's speculative and hard to predict immediately.

Tweet 13 talks about upgrades to GOOG and other companies, which could influence Amazon's stock price by signaling growth potential or risks, but again, this is a bit of an educated guess and not directly related to AMZN's performance yet.

Tweets 14 and 17 are more personal messages with no clear connection to the company. They just seem like casual comments without any actionable information about the stock.

Considering all these tweets, especially the ones talking about potential moves towards AMZN (tweets 1-5) and a possible sell-off in other companies (tweets 12), it seems there are mixed signals. The positive tweets suggest Amazon could go up, but the negative tweets indicate other factors might be affecting the market.

However, since the user is asking for an overall conclusion based on these tweets alone, I can't make a definitive assessment beyond what's stated. There are both positive and negative indicators, which don't tip one entirely in either direction yet."
2015-08-12,Negative,"Okay, I need to determine the likely impact on the stock price of the company based on these tweets. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. **First Tweet**: The user mentions yuan's drop weighing on world markets and lists several stocks like spy, qqq, amzn, etc. This seems positive because it affects investor sentiment, but I'm not sure if the impact is significant enough to outweigh any negative points.

2. **Second Tweet**: Panic selling at the open buying more suggests a lack of confidence, which could be negative.

3. **Third Tweet**: Jeff Bezos is encouraging others to put customers first and stay patient with amzn. This seems like a positive announcement that investors might take seriously.

4. **Fourth Tweet**: Amzn seems not to care what's happening in the rest of the market, only focusing on its own performance. This could mean it's focused too much on its own success without considering others' reactions.

5. **Fifth Tweet**: RSI and RSI-like divergence suggests some bearish sentiment as the stock may be overbought or oversold.

6. **Sixth Tweet**: Alerts show some positive news about spy, nflx, googl, etc., but maybe not too detailed.

7. **Seventh Tweet**: Hedging a portfolio shows potential for future gains from these stocks, indicating some confidence in their performance.

8. **Eighth Tweet**: insider selling at three companies is disheartening, which could be negative if it's a significant shift in investor sentiment.

9. **Ninth Tweet**: Amzn retires product ads, which might affect its financial health and thus the stock price.

10. **Tenth Tweet**: John Thompson shorted amzn and tsla, which indicates some strategic involvement but not necessarily positive or negative information.

11. **Eleventh Tweet**: John was discussing amzn on AT_USER, suggesting he's involved in sentiment analysis or might be looking at this for potential trading purposes.

12. **Twelfth Tweet**: The user is clarifying their understanding of the market dynamics, perhaps reflecting on the overall situation without extreme emotions.

13. **Thirteenth Tweet**:uber is attracting investors, which could indicate positive news about the company's growth potential.

14. **Fourteenth Tweet**: Mis PR metrics for aapl, gmexic, amzn are slightly down but not overwhelmingly so.

Considering all these points: The user seems to have mixed signals with some positive and negative aspects. They mention customer focus, strategic investments, market trends, and sentiment analysis. There's a mix of panic selling and balanced comments about the company. The overall sentiment is somewhat mixed but leaning towards uncertainty due to the mix of positive and negative factors.

I'm not entirely sure if this is a clear positive or neutral because there are both positive aspects like customer focus and strategic moves, as well as negative points like panic selling and some market analysis. However, without more context on how these tweets will be interpreted by investors, it's hard to say definitively."
2015-08-13,Positive,"Alright, I'm going to try to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by understanding what each tweet is saying.

First tweet: It mentions profits and a bunch of words like meme, meme, etc., but nothing concrete about Amazon's performance or future plans. It looks like it's just adding some random stuff without giving any meaningful info.

Second tweet: Discusses AMCCApplied and their circuitry products. That sounds like an investment piece or maybe a news article that could influence stock prices, so this might have some positive impact.

Third tweet: Talks about the earnings season for Amazon. Earnings season is when companies are excited about future profits, which can boost stock prices. This seems supportive.

Fourth tweet: Just restating previous information and something about 540, but without specifics on what it means or any related news. Not much to go on here.

Fifth tweet: Talks about AMZN being bullish and showing a price increase. This is clear and positive, which should contribute positively to the stock price.

Sixth tweet: Looks like the user is waiting for something via drone, but again, without details, it's just filler text that doesn't provide any relevant information.

So, putting this together: The first tweet adds randomness. Second is about a tech company's products. Third mentions earnings season—positive. Fourth restates previous. Fifth says AMZN is bullish. Sixth is extra info.

Overall, the most important tweets here are the third and fifth. Third suggests that Amazon might have good results in the future, which is positive. Fifth clearly states that they're bullish, which is a strong sign of confidence. The other tweets don't add significant information or sentiment beyond what's already stated.

Therefore, I think the overall sentiment is Positive."
2015-08-14,Negative,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of cvc cablevision systems. Let me start by breaking down what each tweet is saying.

First, there are a bunch of hashtags like $cvc$, $dwti$, and $amazon$. Those probably indicate that someone is interested in or watching this company's stock or something related to it. But I'm not sure how much they matter yet. The word ""stock"" might suggest more context, but nothing specific right now.

Looking at the tweets one by one:

1. ""cvc cablevision systems stock forum URL $ cvc $ dwti $ amzn $ panw cvc stock stock""
   - This seems like a lot of questions or possibly irrelevant information. The mention of ""forum"" and ""url"" might be part of another thread, but it doesn't seem to relate directly to the company. I'm not sure what this tweet is about.

2. Another one: ""$cvc$"", which could be referring back to the first tweet or maybe just random hashtags.
   - Maybe someone is searching for information about cvc cablevision systems on Twitter. Not sure if that's helpful yet.

3. ""dwti"" – I'm not familiar with this index. DWTI stands for Dijon Wide-Terminal Index, which is a stock market index. If someone mentions it, perhaps they're tracking this specific sector or index.
   - It's possible that someone else is looking into this index and could have information about its performance.

4. ""amzn"" – Amazon is a big name in tech. Maybe someone is asking how cvc cablevision systems is doing relative to Amazon stock?
   - This could be a comparison tweet, but without more context, it's hard to say if that would affect the stock price negatively or positively.

5. ""panw"" – I don't recognize this acronym. It might not be a known keyword or term here.
   - If someone used incorrect spelling of ""panw,"" maybe they were referring to something else, but without context, it's unclear.

Looking at the negative word ""negative"" in some tweets. Maybe people are worried about things going wrong? Or perhaps there's some concern from news related to this company or sector.

But putting all these together isn't giving me a clear picture. It seems like several tweets are either irrelevant or tangential, and others might be trying to gather information without addressing the stock price directly. Without specific details on what each tweet is indicating about cvc cablevision systems, it's challenging to assess their impact on the stock.

I think maybe some of these tweets are promotional for a product launch or something else unrelated. The lack of relevant context makes it hard to determine if there's any positive or negative impact on the company's stock price."

2015-08-16,Neutral,"Alright, I need to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the company. The user provided some tweets, but they're mostly repeating the same message over and over. Each tweet seems to mention the user's excitement about $ngcg profits with various memes or unrelated terms like URLs.

First, I'll break down the task. The process involves identifying the target stock symbol from the tweets, which isn't explicitly given here. Since each tweet doesn't provide a specific stock name, maybe I can infer it from context, but that's uncertain because the information is missing. 

Next, I have to analyze each tweet for positive or negative factors. Each tweet mentions $ngcg profits and lists items like meme, URL, etc., which don't seem directly related to the company's financial performance. They might be trying to engage with the user or their audience, not necessarily impacting stock market indicators.

Then, assessing sentiment—each tweet is in a ""rt AT_USER"" format, which usually means users are expressing positive or negative sentiments. But without knowing if they're happy or upset about the profits, it's hard to determine if these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative towards the company.

Since all the tweets just repeat similar messages and don't provide any specific information about the company, I can't assess their sentiment towards any particular stock. It's possible that these tweets could be a form of social proof or engagement, but it doesn't translate to an actual impact on the stock price. 

Considering there are no clear positive or negative factors mentioned in each tweet and no actionable information, it's reasonable to conclude that there's no clear sentiment influencing the stock. Therefore, the overall sentiment is neutral.

I'll make sure my conclusion clearly states ""Neutral"" as this aligns with not having any evidence of positive or negative impact."
2015-08-17,Negative,"Alright, I'm trying to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of Amazon's stock symbol AMZN. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

Starting with tweet 1, it mentions a penny stock pick and gives some URLs without specific details, so that might not provide much information. The URL doesn't look like an email address or social media handle but is just the company's name. So this tweet seems a bit vague in terms of sentiment towards AMZN.

Looking at tweet 2, it talks about a harsh exposure on Amazon's workplace and mentions the New York Times. While that might imply some negative attention from investors due to workplace issues, I'm not sure if it directly affects AMZN stock performance.

Tweet 3 is more informative—it lists several companies, including PNC, JPMorgan, etc., which are all related to the healthcare sector. However, these don't mention anything about Amazon or its stock price. So this tweet seems to be making general comments without targeting a specific company or providing any clues on AMZN.

Tweet 4 mentions recent activity in Q2 for companies like SPX, IBM, etc., but again, no information about AMZN. This could mean that the tweet is more of a commentary rather than affecting stock prices directly.

Tweets 5 to 13 are all testimonials from someone who praises ngcg products, which aren't related to Amazon. The user seems enthusiastic, so this might be expressing positive sentiment towards a brand, but again, no specific mention of AMZN or its stock.

Tweet 14 discusses a spy short squeeze triggered by news on August 17th, 2015. This is a serious event where Amazon's shares were being sold short, which could have negatively impacted the stock price. The mention of the S&P 500 index and the date makes it seem like a significant event affecting AMZN.

Tweets 15 to 17 discuss various stocks and products, including weekend reviews on different sectors. These tweets are more about general sentiment or market news rather than specific targeting of AMZN.

In summary, most tweets don't directly mention AMZN's stock but talk about broader company news or speculative topics. However, tweet 14 is particularly significant as it relates to a specific event that could have negatively impacted Amazon's stock price."
2015-08-18,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze the given tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. **First Tweet**: It suggests that it might not be coincidence that two days ago, $WMT announced poor guidance, but this news didn't ring a bell. The user thinks it's not relevant. That seems like some speculation and maybe not too positive.

2. **Second Tweet**: The tweet mentions AT_USER talking about AMZN trading on earnings, competing with AMZN on price to hit earnings hard. This could influence investor sentiment positively by suggesting potential good news for AMZN.

3. **Third Tweet**: It says that the New York Times left out a critical piece of Jeff Bezos' story for Amazon's URL. This is interesting because it implies missing information about a key company, which might affect reputation and stock price.

4. **Fourth Tweet**: The tweet mentions the reaction to all horrible publicity related to AMZN's issues with $WMT: -0.04% drop in stock price. The negative percentage change could indicate investors taking profits or feeling negative, contributing to a negative sentiment.

5. **Fifth Tweet**: It talks about updates on Amazon, YHOO, FB, V, August 18th, 2015, including a list of watchlists and option discussions, markets. This seems like updating on multiple companies, which might indicate diversification but could affect stock performance.

6. **Sixth Tweet**: The user mentions RT $QQQ (which is Alphabet Inc.) triggering sellorders in sigma-x, crossfinder, ats, lx at 10:30 AM, with prices and other metrics. This suggests some trading activity which might be positive for Amazon but could also indicate market interest.

7. **Seventh Tweet**: It discusses a battle among pay-tv subscribers for content rights, leading to the release of product names like $AMZN, $NFLX, etc., in a ""battle for pay-tv subscribers."" This seems to focus on subscriber acquisition but not necessarily impacting Amazon's core operations.

8. **Eighth Tweet**: RT $TSLA (Amazon) mentioned HFT algos breaking certain prices in sigma-x and crossfinder, at 11:48 AM. This is technical trading language suggesting market sentiment or potential for trades based on algorithmic strategies.

9. **Ninth Tweet**: Similar to the eighth, with TSLA's HFT algos breaking prices in sigma-x and crossfinder at 11:44 AM. It seems redundant but confirms previous information about AMZN's stock movements.

10. **Tenth Tweet**: The user claims Facebook is the only constructive name on social media for Amazon, with $AMZN appearing four days in a row. This could imply higher brand awareness and engagement, which might boost stock price.

11. **Eleventh Tweet**: Indicates that $AMZN was front-page news for four consecutive days, suggesting sustained coverage or attention to the company. This could be positive as it shows increased visibility.

12. **Twelfth Tweet**: Talks about a new release of Amazon's product and mentions some vague humor in the title: ""le titre amazon vient de sortir par le haut d'un drapeau de con."" This is more about speculation or humor rather than actionable information.

13. **Thirteenth Tweet**: Alerts on $GEQ (Ge Mueller Quantum Co.) nearly quadrupled in two weeks, highlighting Amazon's growth potential for investors.

14. **Fourteenth Tweet**: RT $AMZN mentions employees being treated like crap and the reasons for it, which could be a red flag or negative news about the company's culture. This would likely decrease stock price.

After evaluating each tweet, I can see that there are both positive and negative elements. The user highlights Amazon being front-page news multiple times and has seen significant price increases ( tweets 9-12), which suggests upward trends but also some speculation about their management. The negative tweet about employees being treated as crap in tweet 14 could have a more adverse effect, especially if the narrative is taken seriously.

Considering all these factors, I think the overall sentiment is mixed but leans slightly positive due to the repeated front-page mentions and noticeable price increases. However, the negative note about employee treatment might weigh against it."
2015-08-19,Negative,"Okay, let me figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of AmZN. First, I need to extract the target stock from the tweets. Looking through the list, it seems the main stock mentioned is AMZN.

Now, for each tweet, I should identify positive and negative factors. Let's go through them one by one:

1. The first tweet talks about market updates and mentions several ETFs like Aapl, spy, intc, etc. This could relate to broader market trends but doesn't specify anything specific about Amzn.

2. The second tweet is a tweet with a link, which isn't relevant to AMZN, so no factors here.

3. Third tweet mentions platinum members seeing stock picks over 550% in 5 weeks. That sounds positive because it's related to increasing stock performance.

4. Fourth tweet discusses insider selling and mentions Amzn, BoFi, Cnce, cru. This is a red flag indicating negative sentiment as insider trading can hurt a company's valuation.

5. Fifth tweet notes that VRTX and Gild have outperformed Google since 2004. Since Amzn was already involved with GILD (which is Apple) before, this could be positive news about their performance relative to competitors.

6. Sixth tweet states that Amzn is getting a little boost, so that's positive because it suggests improvement.

7. Seventh tweet mentions the first delivery of Amazon, which sounds like good news for Amzn as they have a product launch. This can positively impact stock price.

8. Eighth tweet talks about insider selling from David and Carol, but without specifics on AMZN or other companies involved. It's somewhat speculative, so it might not be conclusive.

9. Ninth tweet discusses NFLX (which is another ETF) breaking certain prices relative to others like TSLA, Aapl, QQQ, etc. This could indicate positive news about Amzn as part of a broader market trend.

Putting this together: Positive tweets include the third, fifth, sixth, seventh, ninth. Negative includes fourth and eighth. The overall sentiment seems mixed but leaning towards positive because several positive factors like increased performance from ETFs, product launches, and competitive performance contribute to investor confidence. Although there are some negative indicators, the positives outweigh them."
2015-08-20,Positive,"Alright, let's try to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of [Amazon]. The user has provided four tweets that need analysis.

First, I'll extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. In all of them, it seems to be ""amzn"" since they mention Amazon frequently: ""just 13 stocks beat google since ipo $ goog $ googl $ alxn $ amzn"", etc.

Now, looking at the tweets one by one:

1. The first tweet talks about tweets triggered by a sale in sigma-x and other platforms like ats, lx. It mentions the stock's bid and ask prices. This seems to indicate a market reaction related to Amazon's performance or potential moves due to some news. However, it doesn't explicitly mention positive or negative sentiment towards the stock itself.

2. The second tweet says ""just 13 stocks beat google since ipo $ goog $ googl $ alxn $ amzn."" Here, I see mentions of Google beating three other companies and an IPBO (Initial Public Offering). This could be signaling some investor sentiment towards Amazon, which might imply a positive outlook but not necessarily a strong enough signal to significantly impact the stock price.

3. The third tweet is about free tech analysis complete for ""aapl"", ""amzn"", ""fb"", ""googl"", ""nflx"", and ""tsla"". It mentions completion of an analysis service, which might suggest that some data or research related to Amazon has been compiled. This could indicate increased visibility but doesn't directly translate into positive or negative sentiment about the stock.

4. The fourth tweet talks about a pickup in 10 months for our picks with a 4,000% gain. It also mentions ""platinum subscribers"" and a new pick involving ""amzn"". The wording here seems to highlight growth potential but doesn't specify whether it's positive or negative news regarding Amazon itself.

Now, considering the overall sentiment:

- The first tweet might lead to some discussion about Amazon's performance due to external factors.
- The second tweet could indicate some level of interest or expectation from investors towards Amazon.
- The third tweet suggests more data availability but isn't a direct reaction to the stock price.
- The fourth tweet specifically mentions growth in gains, which is positive.

Looking at the sentiment tags: [Positive], [Neutral], and [Negative]. The second tweet gives a bit of a positive outlook, while others are either neutral or uncertain. Since there's mixed sentiment but some positive notes, I'm leaning towards a [Positive] overall impact on Amazon's stock."
2015-08-21,Negative,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether these tweets will affect the stock price of AmZN (AMZN) or not. Let me break it down step by step.

First, each tweet is labeled as a relevant tweet. I'll go through them one by one.

1. The first tweet says ""rt AT_USER if we don't break soon we would anticipate a decent squeeze after 11am . $ nflx $ tsla $ aapl $ fb $ amzn $ googl"". It looks like it's comparing AMZN to other stocks and mentions a potential squeeze at 11 AM. Squeezes can affect investor sentiment, possibly causing them to sell off their shares. That could lead to a negative impact on the stock price.

2. The second tweet is a repeat of the first one with similar content. It's also talking about a possible squeeze and multiple tech stocks. Again, this mentions potential market conditions that might push investors away, leading to concerns about lower demand for AMZN shares.

3. Third tweet: ""the large institutions that sold $ amzn day after earnings were a big signal , went home with their profits , said no mas"". Here, the sentiment is about institutions selling their stock after earnings and saying they didn't make money. This sounds like a positive sign because it shows confidence in the company's profitability. Positive signals can boost investor confidence.

4. Fourth tweet: ""rt AT_USER qualcomm reportedly to enter consumer drone market $ qcom $ amba $ gpro $ fb $ amzn $ goog : full story URL"". Qualcomm entering the drone market is a positive news for AMZN since drones are used in various sectors like delivery and security. This could increase demand, which might improve the stock price.

5. Fifth tweet: ""$ amzn indian shares join global sell-off URL"". This seems to be a link or reference to Indian shares joining the global sell-off. If AMZN's shares are selling off globally because of economic reasons related to India, that would definitely lower the stock price negatively.

6. Sixth tweet: ""this party is not over til $ iwm is under $ 100 and $ amzn cracks"". I'm not sure what this tweet is about. It mentions a local party (iWM) being under $100 and AMZN breaking, which could imply that the stock might drop in value if things go south.

7. Seventh tweet: ""option millionaires : jimmybob : $ amzn 507 URL"". This seems to be discussing options trading, mentioning names like JimmyBob and a price target of $507 for AMZN. While this is about the stock's price, it might indicate that the company could see significant gains due to interest rates or market conditions, which can affect investor sentiment positively.

Now, combining these thoughts: The first three tweets mention a potential squeeze at 11 AM and positive news from other companies entering sectors. But then there are mentions of a global sell-off, which is negative. The fourth tweet talks about a drone market, which is positive but possibly short-term. The seventh tweet could be a positive signal for price targets.

However, the global sell-off (tweets 5 and 6) seems like a strong negative factor. It's possible that this will cause a significant decline in AMZN shares, affecting the overall sentiment negatively. Despite other positive tweets, if there are signs of a sell-off due to economic reasons or geopolitical issues, it could outweigh the benefits from other companies entering new sectors."
2015-08-22,Neutral,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on a company's stock price. The user provided some tweets and asked me to analyze their likely effect using [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Let me break this down step by step.

First, from what I gather, the target stock symbol isn't directly mentioned in the tweets, so I'm not sure which one we're talking about here. But looking at the tweets themselves, they seem to be discussing various topics without any specific context linking them to a particular company. So maybe each tweet is independent? That could complicate things because each tweet might have different implications based on their own content.

Now, looking at the tweets provided:

1. ""retirement strategy : when there is blood in the streets , will you become a vampire ?"" URL $ amzn $ nflx $ tsla $ jnj $ pg

Hmm, okay. The user wrote a query with multiple URLs, which are probably stock ticker symbols: Amazon (AMZN), NFLX (which I think is NFL's stock), TSLA (Tech & Science Group), and JNJ (Investor Networks Group). So the target stock isn't specified here.

Next step is to analyze each tweet separately. Since all the tweets don't specify a company, but they're all related to stock symbols and something about becoming a vampire if blood is in the streets—maybe it's a joke or reference? I'm not sure how that connects to stock performance.

For each tweet:

1. ""retirement strategy"" seems like a general topic without context.
2. The part after the colon: when there's blood in the streets, will you become a vampire? This is a classic riddle where ""blood in the streets"" refers to blood in your own body if you're telling it off—so maybe it's a joke or riddler-like play on words.
3. URL for each stock symbol suggests these are different stocks.

Without any actual content about how these stocks perform, I'm stuck because each tweet is just stating facts without any analysis of their impact on the market. So, if each tweet is standalone and doesn't connect to a specific company's performance, it's hard to determine the overall sentiment for any particular stock.

But wait, maybe the user made a typo or intended this as part of a larger query about a single stock. Maybe ""JNJ"" refers to JNJ Corporation? Let me check: JNJ is indeed a financial services firm, sometimes referred to as ""The Big Four,"" but it's not a big tech or financial stocks like AMZN, NFLX, or TSLA.

Alternatively, maybe the URL was meant to be a company symbol, and I'm supposed to infer based on the content. Since all these tweets are about becoming vampires if you're in trouble, which doesn't relate to any business or stock performance, it's unclear how they affect the market either way.

Since each tweet is separate and not tied to a specific company, there's no data available for analysis. Therefore, I can't determine whether each tweet positively affects a stock or not because there's no context linking them to a specific company's stock price movements. So maybe all tweets have [Neutral] impact since they don't provide any relevant information about the company.

Alternatively, if all the URLs are different stocks with no correlation in their content, the overall sentiment would be neutral as none of them contribute to or against the stock performance without context.

I think I need more information—specifically, a target stock symbol—to properly assess the impact. Without that, it's just speculation based on unrelated tweets about becoming vampires if someone gets blood in the streets."
2015-08-23,Positive,"Alright, let's break down how I approached this problem.

First, I looked at the user's query about analyzing tweets to determine their impact on stock prices. The tweet provided mentions ""AMZN gap fill and now see how it acts at 50 day . URL URL"" followed by a toast message with some symbols. 

I started by identifying the target stock symbol from the relevant parts of the tweets, which is AMZN. Then, I separated each tweet into Positive and Negative factors. For the first tweet, I noticed that it's about analyzing the company's performance metrics for the 50-day period, which suggests a positive factor related to market analysis.

The second tweet uses a toast message with emojis that probably convey a cheerful or enthusiastic tone. Toast messages often increase investor interest and sentiment positively, so this likely adds a positive factor as well.

Next, I evaluated the overall sentiment by considering how these factors might influence investor decisions. The mention of a 50-day gap fill indicates a strategic move to improve performance, which is positive for long-term growth. The toast message adding excitement further enhances confidence in the stock's potential. 

Since all relevant factors are positive and contribute to a optimistic outlook on AMZN, I concluded that the stock is likely to be [Positive]."
2015-08-24,Negative,"Alright, so I need to figure out how these tweets are affecting Amazon's stock price. Let me start by looking at each tweet one by one.

First tweet: It mentions a retirement strategy and talks about ""when there is blood in the streets."" Hmm, that seems like a metaphor for economic stress or bad news in the markets. The user is talking about AMZN's performance relative to another stock (NFLX). If there's something called ""blood in the streets,"" maybe it refers to economic instability or financial issues affecting the market, which would likely cause a negative impact on Amazon.

Second tweet: It says that Amzn only went down 6%, but should have been much more down than another stock, NFLX, which went down 13%. That's a big number difference. So if Amzn is only down 6% while the other stock is down 13%, it could indicate that Amzn isn't performing as expected relative to its peers or expectations. This would likely make Amazon's stock look underperformed and possibly negative.

Third tweet: It lists several stocks but has no meaningful information in the link. Maybe it's a placeholder for a specific company or data point. Without much content, this tweet might not provide actionable info, so I'll consider it neutral.

Fourth tweet: Talks about tracking a portfolio from Q2 2015. That seems like looking back at historical performance to predict future trends. If the user is evaluating how Amazon did in the past year, that could affect investor sentiment by showing past successes or missteps. However, since it's talking about history and not current or future market movement, it might not directly impact the stock price much.

Fifth tweet: Suggests buying growth stocks during a market sell-off discount deals like ""discount bin."" If Amazon is suggesting to buy stocks when others are selling (a common strategy), that could be seen as a positive indicator of good investment opportunities. But if this tweet is just advice for another company, the impact on AMZN might be limited.

So combining these thoughts: The first tweet points to bad market conditions affecting Amzn relative to others. The second tweet shows underperformance when compared to another stock. The third and fourth tweets don't add much info. The fifth suggests buying stocks in a bad sell-off. 

Overall, the main issues are poor performance relative to peers and underperformance compared to another stock, which are both negative factors. So Amazon's overall sentiment is likely Negative."
2015-08-25,Negative,"Okay, so I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price and determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative.

Looking at the first tweet, AT_USER mentions asking about a $5 Kindle. That seems like a product appeal, which could be seen as positive because it might attract more attention or investment. But I'm not sure if this is enough to outweigh other factors.

The second tweet talks about the Dji and other indexes going down, especially during the power hour. This could affect investor sentiment negatively, but it's hard to tell how significant it is without knowing the context of the power hour event.

Third tweet is critical, calling NFLX service bad and comparing AMZN stocks as overvalued. That's a strong negative factor because overpriced stocks tend to decline. The mention of Diaz closing down by 10% is also a serious concern for investors, especially if they're invested in Amazon.

Fourth tweet brings up an AT_USER discussing the market at a specific time and mentions several stocks related to music, video games, etc. This seems like more of a marketing tactic or promotional content, which might not directly impact stock price but could influence investor behavior positively by increasing demand for AMZN products.

Fifth tweet is about tuning in for a discussion on AMZN at a certain time. It's a call to action but doesn't provide specific information that would be useful for predicting stock performance.

Sixth tweet talks about AMZN news mentioning potential market crashes and specific stocks. This could lead to investors preparing or waiting for the stock to adjust, which might not have a significant impact on the price immediately.

Seventh tweet is similar to the third one but says ""a group of authors"" instead of ""a group of AT_USER."" While that's just a different username, it still represents a negative view towards Amazon, so it adds to the overall sentiment.

Eighth tweet lists AMZN stocks involved in certain projects or partnerships. This could be seen as positive if they're part of critical products or collaborations, but without specific information about what those projects are, it's hard to assess its impact on the stock price.

Putting this all together, there are clear negative factors like overvaluation and potential market crashes. The other tweets don't seem strong enough to outweigh these concerns. Therefore, I think the overall sentiment is Negative."
2015-08-26,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a given company. The user provided a set of tweets and wants an analysis using a specific structure. 

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the tweets, some mention $ amzn, which is Amazon, while others like $ twtr or $ sune are other companies. Since the output needs to be focused on one company's impact, maybe Amazon is the one we'll analyze. The rest of the tweets might not affect Amazon's stock price significantly.

Next, for each tweet, I should separate the factors into positive and negative ones. For example, tweet 2 talks about workers getting new tools for airing their grievances, which could reduce workplace tensions and improve morale, leading to a positive sentiment towards Amazon. On the flip side, some tweets like tweet 7 mention strong durable goods and upgrades, which might support Amazon's product developments.

I also need to assess each tweet's overall sentiment by combining the factors and their impact on investor sentiment. For instance, if many tweets are positive but contradict each other, it could be neutral because opinions might vary widely. However, in this case, most of the tweets seem supportive or at least not negative towards Amazon except for some that are speculative, like a URL about turbulence.

After analyzing all 12 tweets, I'll summarize how each contributes to Amazon's sentiment. If there's a clear majority of positive factors without too much uncertainty, the overall sentiment would be positive. There's also no major negative tweet mentioned, so it's less likely to be negative.

So, putting it all together, considering both the factors and sentiments, the overall impact on Amazon's stock price seems to be positive."
2015-08-27,Negative,"Okay, so I'm trying to analyze these tweets about Amazon's stock price impact on their future stock price. Let me break down what each tweet is saying.

First, I need to identify the stock they're talking about. Looking at some of the tweets, I see mentions like ""AMZN,"" ""TSLA,"" and others. So, the target stock seems to be Amazon, specifically AMZN for Tesla (TSLA) and Amzn for Amazon. 

Now, looking at each tweet individually:

1. The first one talks about trolls arriving on Twitter and mentions selling $AMZN with put options. That's a negative sentiment because they're selling shares.

2. The second tweet has a CRM URL connected to several companies like CRM, ebay, GS, etc., which seems unrelated to AMZN or TSLA. So maybe not relevant for this analysis.

3. The third tweet mentions cutting off Amazon's URL with a cut and buy offer at Vertrac, but it doesn't mention selling shares or negative sentiment about AMZN. Maybe neutral here?

4. The fourth tweet says YouTube gaming is coming to take on Twitch and mentions Google and Amazon. That's another mix of unrelated companies, so probably not relevant.

5. The fifth tweet talks about FANG ( Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google) showing strong performance over the past two days and refers to S&P 500, which is a market index for AMZN. This shows positive news about their performance, but it's more of a company-wide event rather than specific to AMZN.

6. The sixth tweet mentions NASDAQ trade ideas related to Amazon. Again, not directly about selling or investing in AMZN. Neutral here since nothing specific is sold off.

7. The seventh tweet discusses ITW (Illinois Tool Works) with P/E ratio and shares. Not related to AMZN or TSLA.

8. The eighth tweet says the CEO of Amzn is leaving Google. That's a big negative because it could impact their financials, but it doesn't mention selling shares or investing in AMZN.

9. The ninth tweet about AWS announcing next Alexa fund recipients might be unrelated unless those companies are part of Amazon, which they aren't.

10. The tenth tweet talks about account deficit and how if history repeats, the deficit will expand, aiding adjustment. It's a positive sentiment because it's talking about economic factors affecting AMZN.

11. The eleventh tweet mentions Amazon releasing an Alexa fund recipients list. Again, unless these companies are related to Amazon or part of their ecosystem, which they aren't, so probably neutral.

12. The twelfth tweet talks about investment-grade corporate bond funds with specific P/E ratios for different companies. Not directly related to AMZN.

Now, combining all these:

- Positive tweets: 5th (good news on FANG) and 10th (positive economic outlook).
- Negative tweets: 1st (selling shares), 8th (CEO leaving), 9th (related to AWS), maybe others like 7th but not directly tied.

But the overall sentiment seems positive because several positive tweets are supportive, especially the economic outlook. The negative ones might be minor in comparison.

So, I think it's a bit of a mixed bag, but leaning more towards positive."
2015-08-28,Negative,"Okay, so I need to analyze the given tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company and then conclude whether it's positive, neutral, or negative. The user provided a couple of tweets and an example output, which is helpful.

First, let me look at the first tweet: ""rt aidotech : 😎 💬 ai deeplearning machinelearning 💻 🌇 6 machine learning giants to watch $ amzn $ fb $ goog $ ibm $ msf … URL"". Hmm, this seems a bit off. The user is mentioning something about AI and machine learning as experts in deep learning. But the content seems too vague without context or specific information on what aidotech does. It mentions several companies but doesn't give any concrete details about their stock performance. So, I can't figure out the impact on the stock price from this tweet because there's no data or analysis provided.

Next, looking at the second tweet: ""The tech giant amzn is really struggling with the current market... let me know your thoughts"". This one seems more focused and provides some context about Amazon's situation. It suggests that a lot of investors are worried about Amazon's performance due to market conditions. I can see this as indicating potential negative sentiment because it's pointing out a problem or concern related to the company's financial health.

Since the first tweet is incomplete, I don't have any data to analyze its impact on the stock price. Therefore, without information on what aidotech actually offers or their performance metrics, it's impossible to determine if this tweet is positive, negative, or neutral. The second tweet, however, is more actionable and provides some context about Amazon's struggles.

Putting it together, the overall sentiment can't be determined because we don't have enough information from both tweets."
2015-08-29,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze the impact of these tweets on the future stock price of a given company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol mentioned in the tweets. The user didn't specify which stock, but since they're asking about ""future stock price,"" I'll assume it's one of these stocks: fv, amzn, apl, xlu, etc. Each tweet provides information that might influence investor sentiment towards any particular stock.

Starting with the first tweet: ""fv first trust dorsey wright focus 5 etf ask URL $ fv $ baba $ am zn nasdaq."" The word ""fv"" is present, so I think this refers to futures contracts or financial services. Since it mentions ASX and NASDAQ, it might be related to energy or agriculture stocks. If they're looking at futures, investors could buy or sell them based on expectations of future prices, which can affect stock performance.

The second tweet: ""aapl apple , inc . filings URL $ aapl $ am zn dis $ fxb aapl finance invest."" This mentions Apple Inc., known for its tech sector stocks. The word ""filings"" suggests they're checking regulatory filings or financial reports, which could be a positive sign as companies often post earnings. If they're signaling better earnings, investors might buy more shares.

Third tweet: ""amzn URL inc . stock message board URL $ am zn bobe aria sh amzn finance stock."" AmZN is an Amazon stock. The mention of a CEO or company announcement (""bobe"") and their business's performance could indicate positive news, potentially boosting the stock price if they see growth potential.

Fourth tweet: ""xlu utilities select sector spdr bid size URL $ xlu $ goog $ am zn giii xlu pennystocks stock."" XLU is part of utilities. The S&P 500 ETF (SPDR) suggests a broader market-related factor. If the market performs well, this could influence individual stocks.

Fifth tweet: ""amzn URL inc . yield URL $ am zn rsp $ hou.to $ bx am zn tradeideas stock."" Another mention of AMZN and potential yields from Treasury securities or other financial instruments. If they're signaling good economic data that would drive interest rates down, which might increase stock prices as investors see better growth opportunities.

Putting it all together, each tweet is either providing information about the company (like AMZN's performance), financial services (FV), utilities, or broader market trends. These can influence investor sentiment positively by showing confidence in future performance, negatively by indicating potential risks or economic issues, and neutrally by providing details without immediate impact.

Without specific data on each stock's performance or market conditions, it's challenging to assign a clear overall sentiment. However, if any tweet mentions positive news about earnings, sector growth, or upcoming events, that could be a strong indicator of positive sentiment. Conversely, negative news would lean towards the stock being seen as undervalued.

Since I don't have real-time data for each stock, I can only speculate based on the information given. Each tweet contributes to potential analysis but doesn't give enough details to definitively classify it as positive, neutral, or negative without more context."
2015-08-30,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative about Amazon's stock. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

First tweet: ""rycix rydex consumer products summary URL $ rycix $ blk $ dag $ amzn rycix investing stocks"". Hmm, it mentions ""rycix"" which I know is a stock ticker for Amazon (AMZN), and then it links to some URLs. It seems like it's about AMZN and their products, but not something negative or positive.

Second tweet: ""rt AT_USER amazon reveals its funniest customer reviews $ amzn amazon URL URL URL"". This one mentions Amazon revealing customer reviews that are funny. That sounds positive because it's talking about a company's positive experiences with customers, which is generally good for investors.

Third tweet: ""opening up chat room for limited time URL $ spy $ qqq $ iwm $ tsla $ aapl $ fb $ amzn $ nflx $ uso $ dia $ twtr $ baba $ gpro $ amba"". This is about a future event where they open a chat room. It doesn't seem like it's talking about AMZN's financial performance or anything negative, just something about a future action.

Fourth tweet: ""dov dover corp . ex-div date URL $ dov $ rdsh $ gas $ amzn dov finance tradeideas"". This one mentions the ex-divide date for Dover Corporation (DOV) and their stock. It doesn't seem to be related to AMZN, so probably not affecting the stock price of AMZN.

Fifth tweet: ""lly eli lilly & co . open URL $ lly $ mbly $ amzn $ mda.to lly finance nasdaq"". Similar to the third tweet, it's talking about an event or update related to Amazon, but it doesn't mention any negative information about their financial performance.

Putting it all together: The second tweet is positive because of the funny customer reviews. The rest don't seem to relate to AMZN directly, so they're probably neutral. So overall sentiment is positive from the second tweet and neutral on others."
2015-08-31,Neutral,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price. I'm not an expert in investing or stock analysis, but I'll take it step by step.

First, looking at each tweet individually might be a bit tricky since they seem to be related to different companies and topics like stock forums, market data, and financial news. But from the information given, I can extract some key points.

Starting with tweet 1: It mentions investing in $ cvs stock on a forum. The URL has multiple symbols, but it looks like it's about investing strategies or market trends for cvs. So, positive factors might include interest in investing in this company. However, without more context on the sentiment of others reacting to such tweets, it's hard to say if it's really positive.

Tweet 2 mentions the maximum price of $ amzn reaching $517.41 on September 4th with a price level of 515.00. It includes some symbols and the date, but again, this seems like specific data point without sentiment analysis from users. So maybe this tweet is more about providing information or updating market prices rather than influencing investor sentiment.

Tweet 3 talks about goldman Sachs Group having a 52-week high. The URL has several financial indicators like gs, amzn, eum, etc., which could indicate market strength or interest in financials. This might suggest that investors are concerned about the company's performance and think it will rise. Positive factors here could be pointing towards an upward trend.

Tweet 4 mentions cof capital one being short sales. The stock symbols involved include coa, amzn, eem, etc., which are all related to different assets. Short selling is a strategy that can affect market trends but isn't inherently positive or negative without context. It's something that would influence investor behavior based on current market conditions.

Tweet 5 discusses golden age resources, mentioning stocks like gdar and amzn. This could indicate interest in the company's performance and possibly growth potential, suggesting a positive outlook for the stock.

Tweet 6 talks about pek market vectors providing an ETF with a China-based company. ETFs often serve as diversification tools or investment vehicles, but without specific information on whether they're bullish or bearish, it's hard to tell.

Now, considering all these factors: there are positive tweets (3 and 5) talking about financials and growth potential, while some are more about providing data points. The negative tweet seems less likely because it's not targeting the stock directly but rather discussing financial metrics for a different company.

I think overall sentiment is mixed, with some positive thoughts about future performance and others just providing information. Without more context on how these tweets are being acted upon by investors or the companies' actual performance, it's hard to assign a single tag. Maybe ""Neutral"" because while there are some favorable indicators, they're not strong enough to conclusively predict the stock's outcome."
2015-09-01,Neutral,"Okay, I need to determine the likely impact on the stock price of a company based on these tweets. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet mentions AT_USER, which probably refers to Amazon or another user. It talks about retail reports and nonstore sales, which could affect the company's performance but doesn't specify a positive or negative trend.
2. The second tweet is about Apple preparing in-house video productions. While this shows they're investing in their own production process, it might not directly impact the stock price unless there are specific results or news related to their products.
3. The third tweet mentions a blog post about a secondary watch list with multiple tech stocks. This could indicate investor interest but doesn't provide clear information on how it affects the company's performance.
4. The fourth tweet talks about Netflix dipping by 9% due to Fang's sell-off. If Netflix is affected, but unless this impacts their shares directly, it might not be a huge factor for another company.
5. The fifth tweet provides a free tech analysis for Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Tesla, and Alibaba. This could mean there are updates or reports on these companies, which could affect stock prices if they're expected to perform well.
6. The sixth tweet mentions Netflix dropping by 9% due to Fang's sell-off. Similar to the fourth tweet, this might impact another company but not directly the target.
7. The seventh tweet is about trades from the Nasdaq with Amazon, Amatx, Amgnx, Amtd, Amzn, and Atrix. If these stocks are affected by news related to the Nasdaq, it could influence their price, which in turn might affect the target company's shares if they're part of the same sector.
8. The eighth tweet again lists Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Tesla, Facebook, and Google. This is a mix of companies that might have similar issues or different problems.

Looking at all these tweets, most are related to specific companies within a tech sector or major players like Apple, Netflix, Tesla, etc. However, none directly mention the target stock mentioned in the first tweet. Since there's no specific information about the target stock's performance or impact on its share price from any of these tweets, it seems like there's no clear positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

Therefore, the overall sentiment is Neutral because the relevant tweet doesn't provide enough information to determine whether the stock will go up or down."
2015-09-02,Positive,"Alright, so I have to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at each tweet individually. 

The first tweet is about Amazon's video service supporting iOS and Android downloads offline. That sounds like a positive move because having better support for their hardware can improve customer satisfaction and potentially drive sales. Maybe that makes them more popular among users who want compatible devices on their phones or tablets.

The second tweet lists several symbols like $ gpro, $ amzn, $ goog, etc., but it also mentions fintech in 2015 with a specific date: September 09, 2015. Hmm, that's interesting. Fintech was booming back then, especially with things like cryptocurrency and blockchain being more accessible. So, mentioning these could imply potential future growth or expansion into new tech areas. Maybe this is a hint about Amazon looking ahead to new technologies.

The third tweet says ""lol $ 505 on $ amzn ... short now . round 2."" The word ""lol"" seems a bit odd and might be a typo or playful language, but the mention of $ 505 suggests that Amazon's stock price is around $505. Then it says ""short now"" and ""round 2,"" which sounds like technical analysis of some sort, possibly mentioning a short-term move or trend.

Now, putting it all together. The positive tweet about hardware support can boost their reputation, leading to increased demand for their products. The fintech mention gives a clue that they might be looking into new areas, maybe expanding into tech or cybersecurity. The third tweet gives an approximate stock price and hints at some analysis, which could indicate confidence in the company's future direction.

I'm not sure about all these, but it seems like Amazon is doing well on positive fronts, including hardware support and future tech trends, so overall sentiment might be positive."
2015-09-03,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. I'm not very familiar with all the details about these companies or their financials, but I'll take it step by step.

First, looking at each tweet one by one:

1. ""amzn amazon prime to downgrade : are you affected ? URL"" This seems like a statement from Amazon announcing a downgrade of its stock price. The phrase ""prime to downgrade"" is common in financial news to indicate the company's expected performance relative to competitors. So this looks positive because it's showing the expected impact on Amazon's stock.

2. ""$ amzn microsoft , amazon sign $ 108m cloud contract with faa URL"" This tweet mentions a significant cloud contract signed by Microsoft and Amazon, worth over $100 million. Cloud contracts can affect a company's revenue, especially in areas like data analytics and artificial intelligence. Microsoft is a major competitor to Amazon, so this contract could influence Amazon's performance. It might be seen as positive news because it directly impacts Amazon's operations.

3. ""meet the manager of a top performing mutual fund $ gild $ aal $ ual $ vrx $ amzn $ tsla $ pcln $ ma $ v $ googl $ aapl $ fb $ celg URL"" This is talking about a mutual fund manager. The presence of such individuals might not directly impact Amazon's stock price unless the mutual fund is related to Amazon's business or investment strategies, which isn't clear here.

4. ""$ amzn $ csco $ googl $ intc : digits : news diges : URL URL"" This tweet uses hashtags like ""digits"" and ""news diges."" These could indicate that there's some discussion about the impact of recent news on Amazon. It might be neutral because it's speculative and hasn't provided a clear direction for the stock price change.

Now, putting this together:

- The first tweet is definitely positive as it's a direct announcement about Amazon being downgraded.
- The second tweet is also positive because it's talking about a significant contract that could boost Amazon's revenue.
- The third tweet introduces someone but doesn't provide specific information on Amazon or its stock.
- The fourth tweet is ambiguous and speculative, so it adds uncertainty.

Since the first two tweets are clearly positive, they likely have a strong influence. However, without concrete evidence from the other tweets about Amazon's performance, especially since one of them mentions a mutual fund manager, which might be an unrelated sector, the overall sentiment remains somewhat neutral but leans towards positive based on the first two tweets.

I don't see any strong negative indicators here. The third tweet could be misleading if it's about a different company or if there's no mention of Amazon's own performance metrics."
2015-09-04,Neutral,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of the company. 

First, I need to extract the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the tweets, all of them mention $ AMZN because it's the most commonly referenced symbol. So, the target stock is Amazon.

Next, for each tweet, I have to separate positive and negative factors. Let me go through them one by one.

1. ""Los grandes iconos o burbujas son las que no han querido ceder aun $ amzn $ fb $ cmg $ tsla $ nflx si que les falta caer."" This seems like a tweet saying that Amazon isn't happy and is looking to sell, which would likely decrease investor confidence. So, negative factors here.

2. "" worth noting - watch $ amzn hold the $ 498.50 mark ... has all morning . if it breaks ... i'll jump back in seot 11 500 puts . lol."" This is offering a plan to buy a put option at $500, expecting Amazon's price to break below that. It seems like a call to action for the stock to rise, which could be positive or neutral depending on expectations.

3. ""rt $ nflx hft algos broke 98.00 in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 11:12 p / t 90.00 quant $ msft $ fb $ gpro $ amzn $ fb $ goog $ tsla $ aapl $ qqq"" This tweet is linking inflows from different platforms and companies, suggesting significant news that could impact Amazon's stock. It doesn't explicitly state sentiment but suggests broader market movements.

4. ""rt $ qqq hft algos broke 101.85 in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 13:59 . p / t 100.00 quant $ msft $ fb $ gpro $ amzn $ fb $ goog $ tsla $ nflx $ aapl"" Similar to tweet 3, this is linking inflows across various platforms with a price target of $100 for $QQQ. It's part of the broader market analysis.

5. ""rt $ nflx hft algos broke 98.00 in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 11:10 p / t 90.00 quant $ msft $ fb $ gpro $ amzn $ fb … URL"" Again, linking inflows and price targets but without explicitly stating sentiment.

6. ""rt AT_USER not bad , + 2 % performance for $ aapl , $ amzn and $ ms with our portfolio rebalancing tool : URL URL"" This tweet is mentioning user sentiment where customers are happy (plus 2%), which could suggest positive sentiment from the community, but it's vague.

7. ""rt $ nflx hft algos broke 98.00 in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 09:59 p / t 90.00 quant $ msft $ fb $ gpro $ amzn $ fb $ goog $ tsla $ aapl $ qqq"" Another link to broader market analysis with price targets.

8. ""$ qqq news : "" wall street breakfast : all eyes on jobs $ spy $ qqq $ aapl $ amzn $ avol … "" URL analy … URL"" This tweet is offering a financial report, but it's not clear if it's positive or negative. It seems like an update on the company's performance, which could affect their stock.

Now, considering all these tweets, there are mentions of price targets for both Amazon and other companies. The use of ""caer"" (to go down) in some tweets indicates concern about the company's value, but others mention a call to action or community sentiment. However, most tweets either tie into broader market trends or offer buy calls without strong positive or negative declarations.

There are also mentions of user sentiment from AT_USER, which could be a mix of positive and neutral.

Given that many tweets link to price targets or price calls, but the specific sentiment isn't clear (some negative about Amazon's value, others community support), it's challenging to determine a single overall trend. It seems like there's some uncertainty because Amazon is involved in multiple price targets from different platforms and companies.

So, considering all these factors, I'm leaning towards a neutral stance because while there are several factors that could suggest either positive or negative sentiment, the lack of clear declarations on each tweet makes it hard to decide on an overall trend. The company's involvement in multiple price targets might imply increased interest from the market, but without specific details about the stock price movement or expectations, it's difficult to assess definitively."
2015-09-05,Negative,"Okay, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me break down each tweet and figure out their effects.

First tweet is about using marketscan for Android, but it seems unrelated because it doesn't mention anything about Amazon's stock performance. So that probably has no significant impact.

Next tweet mentions that Google, Amazon, and another company are setting consumer expectations due to the ebook game. That sounds like they're discussing potential challenges or issues in e-books, which might affect readership and sales. But I'm not sure if this directly impacts Amazon's stock price because it's more about market trends than individual stocks.

Third tweet talks about a weekly recap focusing on tech stocks, but again, that seems like a general update rather than specific to Amazon. It doesn't mention any news or performance indicators related to the company itself.

The fourth tweet mentions Google and Amazon engaging in drone-traffic challenges via IBDNews. This sounds like a real-world issue that might cause negative sentiment from consumers buying more physical products instead of e-books. If this is affecting sales, it could lead to lower revenue and thus impact Amazon's stock price negatively.

Putting it all together: The first tweet has no effect. The second mentions consumer expectations but doesn't specify if it's positive or negative. The third is too general. The fourth tweet introduces a potential problem with drone traffic, which would likely lead to a negative sentiment from consumers and could affect Amazon's revenue. Therefore, the overall sentiment is Negative."
2015-09-06,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on a company's stock price. The user has provided four tweets and asked me to analyze their likely effect using [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, looking at each tweet individually might help me see patterns or themes that indicate whether the overall sentiment is positive, neutral, or negative. Let me go through them one by one.

The first tweet is: ""$ spy $ pcln $ amzn $ dia $ tlt $ aapl friday cheat sheet supt / res-bots near pendulum - continuation due cheers :d"". Hmm, this seems to be talking about something related to tech companies—specifically mentioning Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and maybe another one. The phrase "" Continuation due to cheers"" suggests that there's some positive energy or buzz around the stocks, which could indicate a positive trend.

The second tweet: ""$ spy $ pcln $ amzn $ dia $ tlt $ friday cheat sheet redbull / reds bull. Apple stock continues up despite the price drop from 10k to 7k."": Here, it mentions that Apple's stock is still going up even though its price has dropped significantly from $10k to $7k. This seems like a mixed signal—so the stock isn't dropping but also not peaking.

The third tweet: ""$ spy $ pcln $ amzn $ dia $ tlt friday cheat sheet redbull / reds bull"": It looks similar to the second one, just maybe a different phrase. Again, Apple's stock continues to rise despite the price drop, so this seems consistent with what I saw in the second tweet.

The fourth tweet: ""$ spy $ pcln $ amzn $ dia $ tlt friday cheat sheet redbull / reds bull"": Another similar structure as the third one, reinforcing that Apple is still on an upward trajectory. So, even though the price has gone down, it's not going back up.

Looking at all four tweets together: The first mentions multiple tech companies and some emojis indicating continuation or support. The other three tweets are about Apple stock either rising despite a price drop or just stating Apple continues to rise. This suggests that Apple's stock is seeing support from various angles—positive media coverage, market fluctuations, and investor sentiment.

Now, considering the overall impact: Even though Apple's stock has dropped in absolute terms (from $10k to $7k), it's still moving up significantly. Investors seem more willing to bear the price drop for the positive outlook or market trends. Therefore, this indicates a positive trend rather than a decline that might be seen in other stocks with lower valuations.

Putting it all together: The tweets are from different sources (like ""reds bull"" which is slang for bullish) and mention Apple stock either rising despite price drops or just reinforcing the upward movement. This combined support suggests a favorable overall sentiment for Apple's stock, making the overall impact positive."
2015-09-07,Missing,File not found
2015-09-08,Neutral,"Alright, let's analyze these tweets to determine their impact on AmZN's stock price. 

First, I'll identify the target stock, which is AmZN. Looking through each tweet, I need to extract any relevant information about the stock.

Looking at tweet 1: It talks about the S&P 500 stocks and mentions several companies, but it doesn't directly talk about Amzn or provide any positive or negative insights. So, no clear sentiment here.

Tweet 2 provides more info on AmZN's financial data and future earnings reports. This could be a positive point because positive earnings reports usually increase investor confidence.

Tweet 3 starts with ""spxl direxion daily s & p 500 bull 3x shares dividend"" but doesn't mention anything about Amzn, so it's irrelevant to our target.

Tweet 4 mentions a weekly S&P100 trend and specific stocks like PCLN. Again, no direct info on Amzn or financials.

Tweet 5 offers a link to Marketscan for trading instead of Amzn, which is neutral towards the stock but just a suggestion.

Tweet 6 talks about AmZN's holdings and nothing else, so it's not relevant.

Tweet 7 discusses AmZN delivering meals from restaurants, which is a marketing strategy rather than financial data. It might be seen as positive by investors because it can boost brand reputation.

Tweet 8 mentions Amzn in the NASDAQ context, but again, no specific financials or sentiment.

Tweet 9 talks about AmZN's future performance with a ""52wk low"" which could indicate potential for recovery, suggesting a positive outlook. However, this tweet seems to be more of an update than analysis without concrete data points.

 Tweet 10 provides Amzn's current price and some stock movements, but it's speculative without specific metrics or trends.

Considering the tweets, while there are mentions of AmZN's performance and positive market trends (tweet7 and tweet9), the information provided is too vague to make a strong conclusion. The lack of specific financial data or actionable insights makes it difficult to determine a clear overall sentiment."
2015-09-09,Neutral,"Alright, let's tackle this analysis step by step. I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a given company based on the provided tweets. The user has already set up the process with identifying the target stock and performing a tweet-by-tweet assessment.

First, I'll list out all the relevant tweets to extract any mentions of the specific stock whose symbol is needed. Looking through the tweets, I don't see any direct mention of a specific stock. That could be a problem because without knowing which stock the user refers to, it's impossible to assess the sentiment accurately. 

Next, for each tweet, I need to identify Positive and Negative factors. However, since the stocks in these tweets aren't relevant or even specified, I can't extract meaningful factors from them. This lack of specific information means that my analysis might be incomplete or based on speculative assumptions.

Then, assessing sentiment is next. The user provided a set of instructions to evaluate each tweet's impact by looking for positive and negative elements. But without knowing the stock in question, these evaluations could be misleading or based on assumptions rather than actual data. This uncertainty means that my conclusions might not hold true in real-world scenarios.

I also have to consider the output requirement: I must conclude with a single tag indicating the overall sentiment as [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Since I don't know which stock is being referred to, I can't decide on an accurate outcome. The user might be testing my ability to follow instructions and provide an informed analysis, but in this case, without context, it's challenging.

I realize that without the target stock symbol, any assessment is speculative and unreliable. This highlights the importance of having the specific information needed for a proper analysis. If the stock was known, I could evaluate each tweet more accurately based on that stock's performance.

In conclusion, despite following the outlined steps, my ability to determine sentiment without knowing the target stock is limited. Therefore, the user might need clarification or provide additional context about the specific stock in question."
2015-09-10,Neutral,"Okay, I need to determine the likely impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price and assign them as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

First, let's look at each tweet individually.

1. The first tweet mentions that Amazon meets earnings estimates in Q2 and beats revenue. That sounds positive because meeting or exceeding expectations is generally good for investors.
2. The second tweet lists a bunch of stock names: NFLX, APPL (which is Amazon), FB, NFLX, SBUX, CLB, TWTR,googl, Uso. It says ""for he knoweth not that which shall be :..."" It's trying to engage in some conversation about the stocks and doesn't provide specific information. Engaging like this might seem neutral because it's more of a friendly interaction than any positive or negative news.
3. The third tweet mentions Amazon is updating their URL, inc., asking for their size, URL, etc. This seems out of context unless there's a specific information about the stock. It doesn't provide direct info on Amazon's performance, so it might be considered neutral.
4. The fourth tweet uses ""rt"" to reply to a user asking players seeking protection in weekly puts into green today on Amazon and bidu stocks. It's trying to engage with a trading strategy but not providing any specific news about the stock price or performance.
5. The fifth tweet talks about S&P 100 trends, including companies like PCLN, GOOG, MO, AMZN, SBUX, V, LMT, CEGL, RTN, FB, INTC, NSC, SO, ORCL, UNP, AXP, COST. It mentions that the stocks trend up or down but doesn't provide any specific positive or negative sentiment about Amazon's performance.
6. The sixth tweet is a repeat of the fifth but in reverse and uses the same URLs. Again, it's discussing broader market trends without providing any specific information on Amazon.

Putting this all together, each tweet seems to be either engaging in conversations with other stocks (neutral), providing general market info (neutral), or just discussing trading strategies without affecting the stock price directly (neutral). There's no clear indication that these tweets will push Amazon's stock up or down. So, the overall sentiment is neutral because none of the tweets provide strong, positive, or negative information that would influence Amazon's stock."
2015-09-11,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze the given tweets to determine their likely impact on the future stock price of a company. The user provided seven tweets and wants me to extract each tweet, separate them into positive (cointent) and negative factors, assess sentiment based on those factors, and then give an overall sentiment summary.

First, let's parse each tweet. I'll look for any mentions of specific companies, stock symbols, or investments. The goal is to find the stock symbol that stands out since it's likely the company in question.

1. The first tweet has ""cc.to cameco corp . news URL $ cco.to $ amzn $ hgd.to $ rax cco.to tradeideas investing."" Here, ""cc.to cameco corp"" and ""rx a co"" are parts of names I recognize, but I don't see the stock symbol. Maybe it's not clear.

2. The second tweet lists ""googl google inc . - class a chart URL $ googl $ amzn $ tlt $ intc googl finance tradeideas."" Again, no immediate stock symbol here.

3. The third mentions ""gild gilead sciences , inc . market cap URL $ gild $ amzn $ dia $ hfd.to gild tradeideas nasdaq."" Still no clear stock symbol.

4. The fourth tweet: ""amzn URL inc . open URL $ amzn $ ua $ xiv $ wmb amzn stockmarket finance."" Here, 'amzn' is mentioned as the company in lowercase. I'll check if there's a specific stock symbol or if it's part of a larger identifier.

5. The fifth tweet: ""sso proshares ultra s & p 500 fund market cap URL $ sso $ amzn $ edz $ enzn sso stockmarket invest."" 'amzn' is present here as well.

6. The sixth tweet: ""itb ishares dow jones u . s . home construction open URL $ itb $ hsd.to $ amzn $ ea itb investing finance."" Again, no immediate stock symbol except 'amzn.'

7. The seventh tweet mentions ""amzn URL inc . open URL $ amzn $ fcx $ w $ inp . v amzn pennystocks invest."" 'amzn' is present again.

Since the user provided a single company and didn't specify which one, I need to make an assumption here. Maybe it's ""AmZN"", the Amazon co., but given the first tweet has comeco corp, which might be part of another company or perhaps a typo.

However, since all tweets mention ""amzn,"" I'll proceed with that as the target company. Now, each tweet is analyzed for positive and negative factors related to 'amzn.' 

Looking at the fifth tweet: It talks about an ultra S&P 500 fund, which could indicate investment activity or sentiment towards Amazon stock.

The third tweet mentions gild gilead sciences, which I know is a biopharmaceutical company. This could have implications for Amazon's performance due to industry competition.

The second tweet lists the S&P 500 index and other financials. An index might suggest investor confidence in Amazon's stock as market conditions are often influenced by broader market trends.

Each positive tweet (like the third or fifth) could boost Amazon's sentiment, while negative factors like gild's situation might affect Amazon. The overall effect would be a combination of these influences, but without specific numbers, it's hard to say the exact impact.

I think the key here is that 'amzn' appears in multiple tweets as part of different topics, which usually indicates investor interest and sentiment towards the stock."
2015-09-12,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how the given tweets are affecting the stock price of a particular company. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking at the tweets, none of them explicitly mention a specific stock. Wait, maybe I missed something. Oh, perhaps each tweet is focusing on different aspects or unrelated stocks? Hmm, that complicates things. Without knowing which stock the user is referring to, it's hard to assess the impact.

But since the problem states that the output should conclude with one of [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative], I have to make a conclusion based solely on the information provided. Maybe the tweets are about trends in general or unrelated sectors, so perhaps they don't directly affect a specific stock's price.

Looking at the tweets:

1. They mention various app stores and URLs, which seem like technical details.
2. These tweets talk about stock trades and companies like MBHC, Google, Amazon, etc., but again, without knowing the target stock, it's hard to pin down.

Given that I don't have the specific stock name from the tweets, I can only speculate based on common trends or general knowledge. For instance, tech stocks often perform well during specific times due to market movements, like Q4 earnings season. However, without context, it's speculative.

Since the output needs a single conclusion and I don't see any positive, neutral, or negative keywords in the tweets related to stock price impact, I might default to [Neutral]. That's because each tweet seems more about trends or unrelated information rather than specific company performance."
2015-09-13,Positive,"Alright, so I've got these tweets about Microsoft and Amazon, and I need to figure out how they'll affect their stock price. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock, it's MSFT. The tweet mentions Microsoft Cloud Services are on the right track with both companies having updated URLs. That sounds positive because it gives them a competitive edge in the cloud market. Microsoft is a big player there, so seeing their URL being updated could mean they're expanding into new areas or improving existing ones.

Next, I should consider other factors. Amazon might be reacting similarly by updating its products or services. Both companies are showing growth and innovation, which is a good sign for investors looking at expansion or strategic updates.

Now, assessing sentiment. The tweet is encouraging both companies to continue their efforts in the cloud space. It's about future performance, not just short-term gains, so it's positive. The mention of being on the right track suggests confidence and anticipation of continued success, which can boost investor confidence.

Putting it all together, the factors point towards good news for MSFT, especially if other companies like Amazon are doing the same. This supportive tone is a clear indicator that the stock is likely to go up. There's no negative information here, just positive signs of potential growth and expansion."
2015-09-14,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on Amazon's stock price. So, I have six tweets here. First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. 

Looking at the first tweet: ""don't let your spouse see your amazon prime orders . share your acct insead $ amzn URL"". It mentions Amazon Prime and shares the account URL, so I think the target stock is AMZN.

The second tweet says: ""one more signMicrosoft cloud services are on the right track $ msft also $ amzn url"". So both Microsoft and Amazon are mentioned. That suggests a positive note about them being on the right track for the market.

Third tweet: ""$ fb $ tsla $ amzn $ aapl some leaders to look at when things resolve."" It lists several tech stocks, but I'm not sure which one is the main focus. Maybe it's indicating that certain leaders should be looked at.

Fourth tweet: ""rt AT_USER congrats 2 gold members locking 25 % + gain on $ nflx this morn ka-ching $ amzn $ goog $ googl $ qqq $ fb stocks AT_USER"". Here, the user is congratulating and mentions NFLX, GOOGL, GOOGLE, QQQ, FB. It seems like there's some good news about companies, which could boost AMZN.

Fifth tweet: ""amazon ceo jeff bezos invests in space - URL - $ amzn url"". Jeff Beros from Amazon is investing in space. That could indicate a strategic move or interest in expanding into new areas, possibly affecting AMZN's performance.

Sixth tweet: ""rt AT_USER weekend review and watchlist URL lion $ spx $ ahs $ exel $ epam $ jakk $ post $ amzn $ ua"". It mentions the S&P 500 (SPX), some other stocks like AH, EXEL, EPAM, JAKK. The user is reviewing the weekend and setting a watch list. That seems more about market trends and general sentiment rather than specific company news.

Now, putting it all together: AMZN is being compared to both Microsoft and Amazon on their cloud services. There's a focus on NFLX and GOOG, which could be good signs. Jeff Beros investing in space might mean something positive for future growth. However, there's some negative attention about COVID-19, as indicated by "" jakk "", so that's a red flag.

I think the overall sentiment is mixed but leaning towards positive because of positive company news and strategic investments, except for the potential negative impact from the COVID-19 concerns."
2015-09-15,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on Netflix's stock price and figure out if it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

First tweet: ""A look at Netflix's new Asian target markets (part i) – south korea URL by trefis team $ nflx $ amzn $ twx"". Hmm, this seems like Netflix is expanding into more markets in South Korea and possibly others. That usually suggests growth and expansion, which can be positive for the stock.

Second tweet: ""$ Amazon, inc. 52wk high URL $ amzn $ feye $ pmcb $ gld amzn nasdaq pennystocks"". The user mentions that Amazon has a 52-week high price. High prices are generally positive indicators because it could mean higher demand or better earnings. So this seems like a positive sign.

Third tweet: ""$ Amazon, inc., exchange rate URL $ am znx to $ xli $ wmt amzn stockmarket finance"". The user is talking about the stock market's overall state and some exchange rates for Amazon. Exchange rates can impact financial health, but I don't see any clear positive or negative cues here. It seems neutral.

Fourth tweet: ""$ Amazon, inc., growth in India has been impressive as the company builds a loyal userbase."" This mentions growth in India and a growing user base. Strong growth trends can boost investor confidence and improve stock performance. That's definitely a positive factor.

Fifth tweet: ""$ Amazon's potty problem : too many dudes , not enough toilets, workers complain ... $ amazon • $ amzn URL"". There's a complaint about the company's facilities affecting its workers. That's serious news related to operations. It could lead to negative sentiment if it affects the business model or reputation.

Now, combining these thoughts: Netflix is expanding into more markets (positive), Amazon has strong fundamentals like high stock prices and growth in India (moderately positive), and there are issues with Amazon's facilities that might hurt them. The net effect seems mixed—some good signs but some red flags. However, the initial expansion and growth trends are the strongest indicators. I think overall sentiment is still positive.

Wait, let me double-check: Netflix's target markets expansion is a big plus. Amazon's 52-week high suggests strong fundamentals. The potty issue is bad news but maybe not as impactful as others. So with two positives and one negative factor, it might lean towards positive but cautious."
2015-09-16,Negative,"Okay, I need to determine how these tweets impact the stock price of Amazon and others. Let's go through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet says they're cutting jobs at HPE to 30k more. That sounds like a negative thing because job cuts usually affect companies' budgets, which can hurt profits. So that's negative.

2. The second tweet introduces a deal where prime members can access a digital paper for free for six months and then discounted after that. This is a new product launch or partnership. Depending on how it aligns with Amazon's strategy, this could be positive if it fills a gap in the ecosystem, but if there are concerns about quality or competition, it might be mixed.

3. The third tweet mentions RBC capital analyzing on URL. While I'm not sure what URL is, analysis often affects stock price. If they're saying something that could negatively impact Amazon's strategy or product, that's a red flag for negative.

4. The fourth tweet talks about NFLX (Nflx) being triggered buy orders in several apps like Quant, Meta, Tesla, Amzn, FB, Googling, and TSLA. Buy orders are usually good news because they increase demand and can improve price visibility, which is positive for Amazon's ecosystem.

5. The fifth tweet uses ""stockoptions investing"" but repeats similar phrases about inflating cash. It doesn't mention any new product or service, so it's likely a bit of buzzwording without concrete info. This could be neutral because it might not significantly affect the stock price yet.

6. Similar to tweet 5, just repeating the same buzzwords again. Without specific details on products or services, it's probably not influencing the sentiment strongly; thus, neutral.

7. Another repetition of tweet 5 with more stock options buzz. Again, too vague for a clear impact, so still neutral.

8. The tweet introduces a study by spy, amzn, nke (which might be Microsoft or another company). If it's related to their products or services, this could have mixed effects. However, since it's about market gaps and trading strategies, it might not directly affect Amazon's stock price positively. It could be neutral because it's speculative.

Summarizing, the main negative points are the job cuts and potential product issues from RBC capital and the study tweet. The positive point is the increased demand from NFLX. However, without specific product information or clear market data, the sentiment overall might lean towards a bit of mixed but leaning positive due to inflating cash."

2015-09-19,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on Amazon's stock price. First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet, it mentions $550 should come early next week with a test at $580, so that seems like the stock in question is Amazon. 

Next, for each tweet, I'll break them down into factors: positive and negative. For each tweet, I'll assess if the sentiment is positive, neutral, or negative, then combine these to give an overall assessment.

The first tweet talks about a test price target of $580 with a previous target at $550. That's talking about future price movements, which relates to stock price changes, so that's a factor. It doesn't mention anything positive, but it does talk about potential gains, so maybe I should consider positive factors here.

The second tweet is all motivational language, mentioning things like ""fearless"" and being part of the top motivational list. That seems positive in terms of investor sentiment because people are feeling hopeful or encouraged to invest. So that's a strong positive factor.

The third tweet is also a motivational tweet about donuts and cheat days. It mentions investing and trade ideas, which adds more confidence and excitement for Amazon stock. Positive factors here too.

Fourth tweet has a mix of positive words like ""inc,"" ""investing,"" and mentions tech stocks. It's encouraging investment activity, so that's good.

The fifth tweet is again motivational, talking about feeling hopeful due to a food-related event but with some jokes. Maybe not as strong as the others because it's more casual and less specific to stock price changes.

Sixth tweet includes ""Facebook filings,"" which might indicate an upcoming earnings report or financial move, possibly positive if Amazon is expected to be involved. So that adds another positive factor.

The seventh tweet is talking about past performance at $86 on Facebook but mentions passing it, so that's a bit negative in terms of recent activity. But the whole tweet seems more positive because it's encouraging investment in Amazon and doesn't mention anything bad.

Now, putting this all together: The first tweet has a test price target which is a factor for future movements, considered neutral or positive. The second, third, fourth, sixth tweets are all positive motivators that could push investor sentiment positively. However, the fifth tweet is more casual and not as impactful in terms of stock price changes.

So overall, combining these, I think there's an underlying positive trend due to the motivational tweets and some positive factors, but the technical tweet might weigh slightly negatively. But since it's about future price movements rather than immediate gains or losses, maybe the positive factors are more significant."
2015-09-20,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. The user provided four tweets and asked me to determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative for Amazon.

First, let me identify each tweet and extract the key information. 

1. ""AT_USER $ amzn retail chains scrap for online grocery market share URL"" — This seems like a suggestion related to Amazon stock, but it's unclear what exactly is being suggested. It might be promoting something, so that could affect sentiment.

2. ""Uso united states oil fund , lp investor opinions URL $ uso $ adep $ wmih $ amzn uso stock stock"" — This tweet is about the Uso Oil Fund and their opinions on Amazon. While this is positive for Amazon because they are investors, I need to see if this adds value or just reports without affecting stock.

3. ""Cort corcept therapeutics inc . yield URL $ cort $ wmt $ amzn $ smh cort invest stocks"" — This mentions cort's quarterly earnings and their impact on Amazon's stock. If cort has good earnings, it could be a positive factor for Amazon. However, if there are concerns about cort's financials or if the stock market is down, that might be negative.

4. ""stocknerds the podcast is posted from this morning's show - here's all the long & short setups - URL $ aapl $ amzn $ tsla"" — This seems to discuss a podcast related to Amazon and possibly other companies. It's more of an opinion piece rather than directly affecting stock price.

Now, combining these thoughts: The first tweet is vague but could be positive. The second tweet adds investor sentiment positively. The third tweet discusses cort's earnings which might negatively impact Amazon if they are on the negative side. The fourth tweet is less direct.

I'm not sure about the exact sentiment of the first and third tweets because their content isn't entirely clear or specific to stock performance. I need to weigh them against the positive influence from the second tweet. If any of these factors make me more confident that Amazon's stock will go up, then it would be positive. If they don't contribute enough or add uncertainty, it might stay neutral.

Overall, without more context on each tweet's specific impact, it's hard to say for sure if the sentiment is strong in one direction. Maybe I'll lean towards [Neutral] because some factors could mitigate others."
2015-09-21,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to determine the impact on the stock price of the given company based on the provided tweets. I'm new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol that's mentioned in the first tweet: fb $. So we're focusing on FB, which is脸谱科技. 

Now, for each tweet, I need to identify if there are positive or negative factors and assess the sentiment. Let's go through them one by one.

The second tweet mentions ""rt $ nflx hft algos triggered sell in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 07:20 p / t 98.00 quant $ msft $ fb $ gpro $ amzn $ fb $ goog $ tsla $ aapl $ qqq."" I'm not sure about the context here, but it seems like the user is selling a lot of stocks. Maybe this indicates a negative sentiment or a sell pressure on FB.

The third tweet mentions several companies and says ""great time in the room today . $ googl $ amzn $ aapl baba $ nflx $ gild $ lnkd always fun when every 1 winstake a free trial."" It sounds like there's some excitement about upcoming trials or maybe a positive event. This could be seen as a mix of positive and neutral sentiment.

The fourth tweet lists several stocks including FB, with the user saying ""AT_USER weekend review video 9/20 $ vix $ fxi $ spy $ iwm $ qqq $ aapl $ amzn $ googl $ fb $ twtr $ jblu $ nflx $ tsla $ amba $ gpro $ mbly htt …"" It's unclear, but maybe the user is sharing something about upcoming events or reviews that could affect FB.

The fifth tweet says ""$ es_f is down 6 points here is my outlook on the week ahead : URL $ spy $ qqq $ aapl $ amzn $ tsla $ nflx $ googl $ vix."" It seems like there's some analysis about the current market conditions, specifically focusing on ETFs and stocks. The user is predicting market performance, which might indicate optimism or pessimism.

Putting it all together, I notice that multiple tweets are discussing upcoming markets or companies, especially FB, while others talk about ETFs and stock performances. Some tweets show sell pressure (like selling more stocks), which could be negative. However, some mention positive trends like ""free trial"" or ""upcoming events,"" which might lean towards positive sentiment.

Considering all these factors—whether there's selling pressure, positive event mentions, or market analysis—it seems the overall sentiment is mixed but leans towards a possible overall positive impact on FB due to upcoming trends and events. But I can't make it certain without more information."
2015-09-22,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze the given tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock from each tweet, which is ""Amazon"" (AMZN). Then, for each tweet, I'll separate them into Positive and Negative factors based on the content provided.

Looking at the tweets:

1. The URL of Amazon was downgraded by Vetr Inc., which doesn't seem to directly relate to Amazon's financial performance. It might affect their stock due to market conditions but not necessarily a direct impact on AMZN itself.
2. The user is liking another leg in Amazon being shown, possibly indicating positive sentiment about the company or products. This could boost investor confidence and interest in the stock.
3. The tweet mentions launching a new product, ""etsy-killer,"" through Amazon using AT_USER. A new product launch can be seen as a positive sign for growth and innovation, which might positively influence AMZN's future performance.
4. The tweet says $ Amzn is trapped URL, which is vague and could mean various things. It doesn't seem to convey specific information about the stock, so it's hard to assess its impact directly on AMZN's price.
5. A mention of TREND.com for Amazon makes me think it's a trend or idea moving in the market, possibly indicating broader interest. This could indicate increased demand and positive sentiment towards the stock.
6. The user is searching for hardware fits, which might show customer interest in new products. If they are looking to sell hardware, it could boost sales and support AMZN as a tech company.
7. Amazon is considering priceline operations with easier laws, which suggests expansion into international markets or a shift towards more global business. This could be seen as a positive trend for growth and profitability.
8. The tweet lists several companies and mentions a drone revolution in taking to the sky. It also talks about more UAVs moving to take to the sky. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are used in various industries, so this might indicate potential expansion into new sectors or services, which could positively affect AMZN's stock.

Now, I need to assess each tweet's impact on AMZN. Tweets 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8 seem more related to broader market movements or customer interest in specific products or companies, whereas tweets 1 and 4 are less directly tied to Amazon's financial performance.

Tweets 2 suggests positive investor sentiment due to the user liking another Amazon segment. Tweet 3 indicates a new product launch, which is generally seen as a good sign for growth. Tweets 5 and 7 relate to broader market trends or expansion in the tech sector, suggesting positive indicators for AMZN. Tweet 8 talks about UAVs, which might indicate increased demand or market interest, again pointing towards positive sentiment.

However, I don't have specific data on how each tweet affects Amazon's stock price. Factors like priceline's potential international reach could affect revenue streams, but it's speculative without more information. Similarly, drone usage in various sectors isn't a direct financial impact.

Given the available information, some tweets are positive, indicating increased interest or expansion, while others are ambiguous but somewhat neutral. However, none of them show strong, conclusive signs that could significantly tip AMZN's stock positively.

I think overall, the positive trends from tweets 2,3,5,7 suggest a favorable outlook for Amazon, which might influence the stock positively despite tweet 4 being too vague."
2015-09-23,Negative,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. The task is to determine if each tweet has a positive, neutral, or negative effect. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking through the tweets provided, none of them seem to directly mention a specific stock. This could be tricky because without knowing which company the tweets are about, it's hard to assess their impact accurately. But let's assume that these tweets might be related to different companies or maybe referencing general trends.

Next, for each tweet, I have to separate positive and negative factors. That means identifying words like ""bullish,"" ""positive news,"" ""good news,"" etc., which would indicate a positive factor. Conversely, terms like ""negative,"" ""bad news,"" ""worst"" might signal a negative factor. However, since the target stock isn't specified, it's hard to determine what kind of information is in these tweets.

Assuming that these tweets are about general market trends rather than specific stocks, each tweet could be influencing the overall market sentiment without targeting a particular company. This means that each tweet might have varying impacts on the broader market.

Now, evaluating the sentiment: Positive tweets would tend to boost investor confidence and stock prices, while negative ones would oppose them. However, since I don't know which specific tweets are positive or negative, it's challenging to assess their impact on a particular company. For example, if a tweet mentions good earnings, it could be positive for the stock. But without knowing the context of that tweet, I can't be sure.

Considering the overall sentiment summary is required, but since each tweet affects multiple stocks (if they're about different companies), this approach might not work. Maybe I need to consider all tweets together and see if they collectively show a trend towards positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

Looking at the content, some tweets mention $ symbols, which could be indicators of positive news regarding stock prices, like increased valuations or expected gains. Others talk about dividends, earnings, market trends, etc., which are common factors that influence stock prices. There's also a mix of general market updates and specific corporate announcements.

Some tweets might not contribute much to the overall sentiment if they're just informational buzz without any concrete data. But others could be pointing towards positive developments.

Given all this uncertainty, I think it's best to consider each tweet in isolation first. If one tweet is clearly positive about increased valuations or earnings reports, that could push the stock up. Conversely, a negative tweet mentioning declining valuations or economic warnings would pull the stock down.

However, since I don't have specific data points from these tweets, I can't definitively say if they're positive or negative towards a particular stock. Maybe some trends are vague and hard to interpret without context. But overall, there's a mix of positive and negative messages here that could influence each other.

In conclusion, without knowing the specific stock being referred to in the tweets, it's challenging to assign a single sentiment label. However, considering the mix of positive and negative indicators, the overall impact on the stock price might be neutral."
2015-09-24,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by identifying each tweet and breaking it down.

1. The first tweet mentions a $5% change in USD per dollar on September 23, 2015. That seems like specific historical data rather than a current news update, so maybe it's too old or not related to Amazon's recent performance.

2. The second tweet talks about amzn updating its near-term high for the day and mentioning some other companies. This is important because it shows that amZN is continuing to trade higher, which could indicate strong sentiment. I'll keep this in mind as a positive sign.

3. The third tweet says Amazon is planning 2 atm calls before November. Although it's unclear what they're calling, if it's related to stock news, that might be a catalyst. But since the exact content isn't clear, I have to assess based on context. If it's positive (e.g., enhancing customer service), it could boost Amazon.

4. The fourth tweet mentions amzn investing in tradeideas and investing on Dailymo. This shows active research and engagement with others, which is a good sign of investor confidence. Active participation often leads to better stock performance.

5. The fifth tweet talks about the S&P 500 dropping by 3x (probably due to bearish news). A large market drop could lead to a decline in Amazon's stock as investors lose confidence, especially if the sector is facing challenges.

6. The sixth tweet calls TLT (Treasury) stocks ""out of the bag"" and mentions other companies on option chats. This seems like a speculative buy signal, suggesting that people are jumping into positions they're uncertain about. This could be a positive indicator as it implies optimism and higher risk tolerance.

7. The seventh tweet predicts amzn's top growth by 20%, which is a forward-looking statement. Positive financial projections can inspire investor confidence and lead to increased stock movements in the long run.

8. The eighth tweet introduces XBI materials, a sector ETF, but with unclear context. If it aligns with amZN's performance or future plans, it might be a positive sign. However, without more info, it's hard to assess definitively.

9. The ninth tweet mentions bid size increases for Amazon. Bid size is a metric used by traders to gauge market sentiment and competition on the price floor. Higher bids can indicate better demand or stronger demand from other sellers, which could be positive for Amazon.

Putting it all together, I see several positive factors like continued trading up, active research, speculative buys, growth projections, bid increases, and investor confidence signals. However, there's a drop in the S&P 500, which is a bit concerning but maybe manageable if other factors offset it.

I should weigh these factors. The positive tweets contribute significantly, especially with amZN's high trading up and active research. The S&P drop could be temporary or due to broader market issues, while the speculative buy signal might push Amazon higher despite some volatility."
2015-09-25,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of Amazon (AMZN). Let me start by breaking down each tweet and evaluating them one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions a URL change but doesn't provide specific information about AMZN's performance. It seems like this tweet is just a random link without any data, so I'll treat it as neutral since there's no clear positive or negative message here.

2. The second tweet also has multiple URLs and mentions Amazon as an inc., but again, it's not giving concrete details about the company's stock performance. Without specific information, this tweet is likely a distractor without any sentiment influence on AMZN.

3. Third tweet talks about a $25/month Twitter rate increase and relates it to some stocks (like Google, Apple, etc.), which might suggest broader economic factors affecting the market. However, without specifics on how these rates affect Amazon's stock price, this is also unclear and likely neutral.

4. Fourth tweet links AMZN to other stocks like ""horizons betapro nymex natural gas bull plus etf tick."" This seems more about future strategies or trends rather than directly impacting AMZN. It doesn't provide any specific information that would tip the balance towards positive or negative sentiment.

5. Fifth tweet discusses the S&P 500's precarious position if Amazon's stock price falls below $193. This is a bearish outlook, but it's speculative because it depends on many factors and is not specific to AMZN. It might slightly affect investor sentiment but doesn't give clear data for assessing AMZN.

6. Sixth tweet mentions tqqq trade ideas and other stocks. While it seems to be about stock trading strategies or sector trends, again, without specific information on AMZN's performance, this tweet isn't contributing anything meaningful for analysis.

7. Seventh tweet talks about intraday support levels with rising SPY sentiment. S&P 500 is a proxy market index, and rising sentiment could indicate a general bullish trend, which might influence investors' opinions on AMZN. This suggests that AMZN's stock could see some positive movement.

8. Eighth tweet discusses the current price of AMZN but doesn't provide specifics about future performance or any positive/negative factors related to it. It just mentions investing and other companies, so this is another random link without actionable data.

9. Ninth tweet introduces a ""guru"" who is boosting AMZN stock. This could imply that the company's management might be optimistic, potentially leading investors to expect more growth. However, without quantifiable data or specific performance metrics, it's hard to say if this leads to positive or neutral impact on AMZN.

10. Tenth tweet talks about dxcm trading and their yield with other stocks. Similar to previous tweets, this seems like a broad topic that doesn't provide concrete information about AMZN's stock price. It might indicate general market uncertainty but no specific influence on the company.

11. Eleventh tweet reports major news affecting some companies (like AEM,goog, NKE, etc.), which could have broader economic implications and affect investor sentiment in multiple sectors. This suggests that overall market conditions are improving or deteriorating, impacting AMZN's stock price. However, without specific data on AMZN's performance, it's hard to determine the exact impact.

12. Twelfth tweet mentions subscribers' returns for a tech stock (hcti) over the past 3 weeks and talks about major updates related to AMZN. While this provides some context on how other companies are performing, it doesn't directly address AMZN's stock performance. It might suggest that tech stocks are doing well, but again, without specifics on AMZN, it's speculative.

After reviewing all the tweets, I can see that none of them provide specific information about Amazon's financial health or upcoming events that could affect its stock price. All the tweets either link to unrelated companies, discuss broader trends, or speculate on general market conditions rather than detailing AMZN's performance. Therefore, based on the given data, there's no clear indication of whether AMZN is likely to have a positive, neutral, or negative impact on its stock price."
2015-09-26,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out how the given tweets affect the stock price of AmZN. Let me start by breaking down each tweet.

First, I'll look at the target stock symbol from any tweet. Wait, looking through the tweets, none of them have a specific stock listed. That's confusing. Hmm, maybe it's not about a specific company or perhaps it's referencing AmZN? Or is this a typo and they meant to mention AmZN somewhere? 

Assuming that one of these tweets refers to AmZN, I need to see each tweet for any mentions related to AMZN or its performance. Let me go through them one by one.

1. ""rt AT_USER special $ 25 / month twitter rate - URL $ lnkd $ pcln $ bidu $ googl $ goog $ nflx $ aapl $ amzn $ amzn."" Okay, this tweet mentions several companies like AMZN, GOOG, NFLX, APLX, and others. It's talking about Twitter rates and investing related to those stocks.

2. ""cvc cablevision systems chart URL $ cvc $ hedj $ am zn cvc stock investing"" This seems to be a link to a cablevision systems chart and mentions CVV,hedj,AMZN for stock investing. So again, AMZN is mentioned here.

3. ""amzn URL inc . investor opinions URL $ amzn $ ea $ intc $ biib amzn pennystocks stocks"" Here, AmZN is mentioned along with other companies like INTC, BIIB, and Pennystocks. It's discussing investor opinions on the stock.

4. ""amzn URL inc . prev close URL $ amzn $ swi $ jnug $ dno am zn"" Again, AmZN is mentioned with some other stocks. The word ""prev close"" might imply looking at recent trends or earnings.

5. ""atvi activision blizzard inc . last price URL $ atvi $ uso $ vym $ amzn atvi invest stock"" Here, ATVI and BLIZZARD are mentioned along with AMZN for investing purposes.

6. ""life as an amazon bike courier , an epic gathering of tech moguls , and a ... … URL amazon • $ am zn life amazon"" This tweet seems to be talking about life as a work-life in the context of Amazon, which is related to AMZN's business. The emphasis on tech moguls might suggest positive trends.

7. ""amzn URL inc . bid size URL $ amzn $ incy $ hyg $ ery am zn"" AmZN is again mentioned along with other companies like INCY and HYG, indicating investor sentiment about AmZN.

From the tweets, it seems that multiple mention of AMZN or similar tech stocks are being discussed. The topics include Twitter rates, cablevision systems charts, investing trends, technology companies, and tech moguls related to Amazon. 

I'm noticing that several tweets are discussing stock performance (like prev close, investing), which suggests a positive outlook on AmZN's future. However, I should also consider the other companies mentioned like TVCG, INTC, etc., but since none of these are specific to AMZN or are directly related to its performance, it might be more about general tech trends and consumer tech companies.

The tweets don't mention any negative factors or significant news that would indicate a potential decline. However, the use of ""tech moguls"" could imply increased interest in tech, which sometimes drives stock prices positively. The emphasis on investing and financial charts supports looking at AmZN's performance for gains.

Considering all these points, it seems like the positive tweets are discussing various aspects related to AmZN or tech stocks that might lead one to expect a favorable outcome. Therefore, despite not seeing any explicit negative information, the general sentiment appears to be positive."
2015-09-27,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price.

First, I need to identify the target stock mentioned in each tweet. The first tweet mentions ""amzn URL inc."" So, it seems like they're focusing on Amazon (AMZN).

Next, for each tweet, I should separate them into positive and negative factors. That means looking for words or phrases that indicate good or bad aspects.

Looking at tweet 1: It talks about the URL's status and mentions trades in the stock market but doesn't specify sentiment beyond that. So, it's neutral here.

Tweet 2 mentions volume but also includes some other companies like alba and alk, which I'm not sure about yet. Maybe they're related to financial reports or something else, so it might be neutral again because of the uncertainty about their impact on Amazon.

Twitter 3 talks about WMT (Warriors Motor Company), P/E ratio, and a list of stocks. It seems like this is more about company performance and could have mixed feelings since P/E can fluctuate but without specific sentiment cues, I'll consider it neutral.

Tweet 4 provides the last price update for FB (FaceTime) stock and mentions AMZN. The company is known for its cloud computing services, which might be a positive indicator. So this tweet suggests that Amazon's shares are up in value, so it's likely positive.

Tweet 5 discusses GLD (Govence Diversified Gold) and EEM (Energy Exporter Gold). These seem like gold ETFs used as a hedge against inflation. I'm not sure how this directly affects Amazon's stock but might be seen as neutral since it's speculative in energy prices, which could have minor impacts on the market.

Tweet 6 mentions NBL (Net Blue Growth) and discusses the nasdaq index with shares from AMZN. Again, NASDAQ is a broad market index, so this could have a slightly negative impact because NASDAQ itself tends to decline when companies like AMZN that rely heavily on it do poorly.

Now, putting it all together: the main focus is on Amazon being involved in cloud services and tech advancements. That's a positive sign, especially if they're expanding into areas where growth potential exists.

Considering each tweet, most are neutral except for tweet 4 which is pretty solid. However, there's some uncertainty about the impact of other companies mentioned, but focusing on AMZN's direct involvement as a cloud provider and growth in technology tends to be positive enough to have a slight positive sentiment."
2015-09-28,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their likely impact on the future stock price of a company. The user has provided a list of 10 tweets and an output requirement where they have to conclude with ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"". 

First, let me go through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions that $hcti has nearly tripled in value over the past three weeks and asks for a next pick. This seems like an update on a stock's performance but doesn't provide any specific news related to its stock price or upcoming events. It might suggest that the stock is doing well, which could be positive.

2. The second tweet talks about trading stocks like $iwm, $qqq, etc., and mentions a URL for something. While it's speculative, mentioning high volumes and including several names suggests potential news related to stock performance or upcoming events, but without more context, it's hard to assess the sentiment directly.

3. Third tweet is similar to the second one, discussing another set of stocks with some volume info. Again, this is general trading advice with no specific stock mentioned. It might indicate a focus on these stocks, which could be positive if they are expected to rise in price.

4. Fourth tweet has a link to a blog discussing $fb news and mentions $aapl, $fb, etc., along with some other stocks. This seems like an update from a blog, possibly offering insights or analysis about the stock's performance. It might indicate that the stock is performing well, so it could be positive.

5. Fifth tweet is about a weekend review video with several companies in its URL. It mentions $spy and others but doesn't provide any specific stock info. Maybe indicating general trading strategies, which might lead to more buys or sells, possibly positive sentiment if expecting more stocks to rise.

6. The sixth tweet refers to a ""huge monthly reversal"" candlestick. This suggests that the stock might reverse in price over the next month, implying potential for higher prices. That's a买入 indicator, so it would be considered positive.

7. Seventh tweet is about quick trades on several stocks but mentions that volatility could provide opportunities. If trading quickly and seeing gains, this might lead to more buys, which could indicate positive sentiment if expected to go up.

8. Eighth tweet is about being a valuation short with $rax, which isn't relevant here. The focus seems on another stock or company. It's unclear without knowing the specific performance of that stock.

9. Ninth tweet talks about trading options and stocks like $fb, $tla, etc., offering a free trial. This could indicate more active trading strategies, possibly leading to buys if expected to rise in price.

10. Tenth tweet is about a beverage company's end-of-period data URL. This is speculative and mentions investing in that stock. It might affect the stock price based on market sentiment regarding its performance, but without specifics, it's hard to assess directly.

Putting this all together, tweets 1,3,4,5,7,9 suggest general trading advice or updates related to stock performance. They might lead to more buy orders, which could indicate positive sentiment if the expected outcomes are gains in prices. The tweet about the monthly reversal (6th) is a买入 signal, which would likely be positive. The overall sentiment seems to lean towards positive as there's a lot of buying intent and potential for increased prices."
2015-09-29,Neutral,"Alright, I need to analyze the given tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of Amzn (AMZN). Let's go through each tweet step by step.

1. **Identify Target Stock**: The target stock seems to be AMZN.
2. **Tweet-by-Tweet Analysis**:
   - **Tweet 1**: Discusses related companies but doesn't specify AMZN.
   - **Tweet 2**: Talks about QCOM, which is unrelated.
   - **Tweet 3**: Mentioned short positions in AMZN with a note on puts and open interest.
   - **Tweet 4**: Refers to NKE, another unrelated company.
   - **Tweets 5-10**: These tweets are mostly unrelated to Amzn. They mention other companies, stock symbols, and possibly some market data but no focus on AMZN.
3. **Factors Analysis**:
   - **Positive Factors**: Mentioned a weakness in the stock (weak), limited put positions, and potential for expansion. But these seem speculative and not directly related to AMZN's performance.
   - **Negative Factors**: None prominent.
4. **Sentiment Assessment**:
   - Many tweets are about unrelated companies or market data without a clear positive or negative sentiment towards AMZN.
5. **Overall Sentiment Summary**:
   - The primary factors mention AMZN's stock but not its current movement. Other tweets don't provide enough information to gauge the stock's performance.

Given that only a few tweets are related to AMZN, it's hard to assess its impact on the stock price. Therefore, the sentiment is **Neutral**."
2015-09-30,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me break down what each tweet is saying.

Starting with the first tweet: ""Our platinum members have been seeing massive gains on our penny stock picks! Subscribe today: URL $ amzn $ qcom $ csco."" This seems like a positive message. The user is promoting their platinum membership and mentions specific stocks that are considered pennies, which might attract investors looking for cheaper options. So this could lead to increased demand, which usually signals good news.

Second tweet: ""RT $ aapl hft algos broke 109.80 in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 09:34 , p / t 108.00 quant $ msft $ fb $ gpro $ amzn $ goog $ tsla $ nflx $ qqq."" The user mentions that some stocks broke, specifically ""broke 109.80."" I'm not entirely sure what this means, but it's possible that the stock prices dropped. If certain stocks are breaking up, it could indicate a sell-off or potential issues with the company.

Third tweet: ""RT AT_USER not every stock was a loser this quarter : $ cmg + 20 % $ googl + 20 % $ amzn + 25 % more : URL URL."" This looks like a positive statement. It says that Amazon wasn't the only one losing in the quarter, with them up by significant percentages. This suggests that while some stocks might have been down, others performed well, which could hint at overall good performance.

Fourth and fifth tweets are similar: ""RT $ aapl hft algos triggered sell in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 09:22 , p / t 108.00 quant $ msft $ fb $ gpro $ amzn $ goog $ tsla $ nflx $ qqq."" Again, the user is talking about selling on those stock symbols and mentions price targets or performance.

Putting it all together: The first tweet boosts demand for specific stocks. The second suggests some stocks may be down but not necessarily bad. The third indicates Amazon wasn't alone in losing; others did better. Each tweet points towards a positive market trend, especially since multiple factors point to potential gains and some companies outperforming.

So overall, the sentiment seems positive because there's increasing demand from attractive stocks and mixed results with some stocks doing better than expected."
2015-10-01,Neutral,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. 

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the tweets provided, all of them mention ""amazon."" So, the target stock is Amazon. Got it.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one to identify positive or negative factors and assess the sentiment.

1. The first tweet seems to be about a review site for e-commerce stocks, so no immediate impact on Amazon's performance.
2. This tweet mentions amzn on its top news on the 1st of October, 2015. That might indicate some significant event affecting Amazon's stock price.
3. A morningstar review gave amzn an ""bbb+"" rating and a negative credit rating. This is a bad score which usually suggests a weaker or negative performance, so this could be negative.
4. The tweet talks about whether the price can get back over B. If it can't, that's a sell signal for Amazon. So, positive sentiment here.
5. This one lists several stocks (aapl, googl, nflx, amzn) but doesn't mention anything specific about Amazon's performance. It seems neutral since there's no direct information on Amazon moving.
6. The tweet mentions the user rating AT_USER and refers to $amzn, so it's about Amazon stock. There's no sentiment here; just a quote from another user.
7. This tweet discusses a stock (udow) from proshares and its yield. Since yields aren't typically indicative of stock performance unless related to interest rates or bond prices, which this doesn't seem to be. So, neutral.
8. The user mentions mbly stock with an NP but no sentiment. No indication of positive or negative opinion.
9. This tweet talks about amzn's inc., volume data from svxy, jjc, lnkd. While amzn is a major company and this might have some market impact, I need to see if it's positive or negative. The absence of any specific news about the stock suggests neutral.
10. The tweet mentions yelp and google moving into on-demand home services. While this could be positive for e-commerce but doesn't directly relate to Amazon's performance in the stock market.

Now, putting it all together:
- Positive tweets: 4 (sells signal) and maybe a mention of AMZN.
- Negative tweets: 3 (bad credit rating), 5 (neutral), 7 (no information), 9 (just mentions the company).
- Neutral tweets: 2,6,8.

So overall, there's mostly neutral sentiment. However, two positive tweets (sell signal) slightly push it towards a little positive."
2015-10-02,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet one by one and see if I can determine whether they're positive, negative, or neutral.

Starting with tweet 1: ""abx barrick gold corp . bid size URL $ abx $ btu $ amzn $ ge abx stockmarket stockmarket."" Hmm, this looks like some company information. It mentions their stock symbol and a few other things like bid size and the company itself. But since it's just extracting symbols and stuff about the company's stock, I don't think it affects Amazon specifically.

Next is tweet 2: ""AT_USER $ amzn amazon pushes deeper into consumables URL."" AT_USER seems to be referring to a user on Twitter, so this could be a bit vague or maybe a typo. It says they push into consumables for Amazon. I'm not sure what that means in terms of stock sentiment. Maybe it's about expanding their product line but nothing concrete.

Tweet 3 mentions something about a tweet feed with quant trading information: ""$ $ $ m sft $ $ msft $ $ fb $ gpro $ amzn $ goog $ aapl $ nflx $ qqq."" This is about financial data and stock prices. If it's showing more stocks and their prices, maybe that's just background info without any actual news affecting Amazon.

Tweet 4 talks about ""Amazon late run given up . needs 522 for higher . now 508 and 504 back in play early."" So, they're saying they're on a downward run because of some data. If the company is underperforming or facing challenges that are affecting their stock, this could be negative.

Tweet 5: ""pwe penn west energy ltd . filings URL $ pwe $ amzn $ bib $ hxd.to pwe stockmarket invest."" Again, it's about a user making a tweet about their company's filings. Filings usually are about the company's governance, regulatory affairs, so unless this is about a regulatory change that positively affects Amazon, I'm not sure.

Tweet 6: ""for an easy way to follow the stocks you are interested in like $ amzn , try marketscan forios : URL."" This seems promotional. It might be suggesting they can easily follow Amazon via a website called Marketscan, but unless there's some positive action or data related to Amazon, this doesn't seem relevant.

Tweet 7: ""$ googl $ amzn : internet ' emperor' pewdiepie taught stephen colbert to curse in … : URL URL."" This looks like it's referencing a meme. Memes often have cultural impact but unless there's some positive message being spread about the company or the meme itself, I don't think this affects Amazon.

Tweet 8: ""rt $ qqq hft algos triggered buy in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 09:48 , p / t 104.00 quant $ msft $ fb $ gpro $ amzn $ goog $ tsla $ aapl $ nflx."" So, it's about someone triggering buys for some stocks. This could be positive if Amazon is doing well or negative if they're performing poorly.

Tweet 9: ""vxx verizon communications open URL $ vxx $ f $ amlp $ amzn vxx nasdaq stocks."" The term VXX might refer to the stock of Verizon, but it's called VXX here and seems unrelated. This could be about another company or an incorrect reference.

Tweet 10: ""$ wmt $ bk $ rax $ amzn : wal-mart considers open sourcing hybrid cloud tools : URL."" Wal-Mart is a retailer, so this might relate to their services. If there's a proposal for open-source technology, it could impact Amazon's products or services.

Tweet 11: ""amazon to halt sale of apple tv and google chromecast URL $ amzn $ aapl $ googl … URL."" This sounds like Amazon is stopping the sale of two products. That seems negative because if they're selling something valuable, it can hurt their business.

Tweet 12: ""nvo novo nordisk a s 52wk low URL $ nvo $ xoma $ xlv $ amzn nvo stock share."" This mentions NVO as a company. If there's any positive news about NVO that affects Amazon, but since it's just a separate company listed, not directly connected to Amazon, I don't think it's relevant.

Tweet 13: ""rt $ tsla hft algos triggered buy in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 19:35 , p / t 245.00 quant $ msft $ fb $ gpro $ amzn … URL."" Similar to tweet 8 and 14, this is about triggering buys for other stocks. If Amazon is involved in a good thing, it could be positive; otherwise, negative.

Tweet 14: ""rt AT_USER $ gld gold soars & stocks tank $ spy after epic job creation failure $ fb $ t $ aapl $ tsla $ f $ gm $ ge $ amzn AT_USER."" This seems like a tweet where someone is suggesting that Amazon is tanking because of job creation failures. If they're talking about the economy affecting Amazon's profits, this could be negative or neutral if it's not backed by concrete data.

Putting it all together: Tweets 4 and 8 are about stock performance from Amazon's perspective. Tweets 12 mention another company but aren't directly related. The rest seem to be either background info, promotional content, or unrelated mentions of other companies. None of these tweets directly mention Amazon's stock price changes, so I'm leaning towards a neutral overall sentiment."
2015-10-03,Neutral,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on stock prices. I'm not super familiar with all the abbreviations and terms here, so I'll need to break it down step by step.

First, looking at each tweet individually. The first one mentions ""membrs"" lesson 10: type of gaps URL $ fb $ tsla $ amzn. Hmm, ""membrs"" is probably a typo for ""members,"" which might indicate something about user counts or membership levels. ""$ fb $ tsla $ amzn"" are keywords related to stock names and symbols. So this tweet seems to be discussing something about the company's current state or future plans with their members.

The second tweet talks about Google, Amazon, AT&T (which is T), and other companies listed in dollars. It mentions a podcast from Amazon called ""at & t."" I know AT&T is a major player in the tech industry, so this could be referring to their stock performance or financial metrics related to their products.

The third tweet also lists some keywords like ""$ long $ es_f ! ! $ ua $ fb $ tsla $ msft $ amzn $ intc $ avgo $ nvda * moore $ eem hmm ! $ gld is a four letter word!"" It's quite confusing with lots of symbols and abbreviations. The mention of ""long"" might imply buying the stock, but other terms like ""es_f"" could be something else, maybe a typo or specific analysis tool.

The fourth tweet says AT_USER at_AT_USER it's great , but $ aapl has squeezed margins b4 $ amzn dash button interesting like u say. This one seems to be criticizing Amazon's earnings ( margins ) and using words like ""dash button,"" which could imply a negative sentiment towards their products or stock performance.

The fifth tweet discusses AMZN adding automatic ordering capabilities to washing machines. That sounds technical, perhaps related to the company's product features rather than financial metrics. Maybe it's about their product portfolio or new products?

Putting this together, each tweet seems to be focusing on different aspects of Amazon's business, including product updates, earnings reports, and market position. Positive tweets might mention improved performance or upcoming features. Negative tweets could be critical comments against margins or poor decisions.

However, without context like actual stock data or technical analysis indicators, it's hard to determine the overall impact. Some tweets are informative about their products (like washing machines), while others are more critical of margins and negative opinions.

I'm not sure if any tweet suggests an improvement in financial metrics since they mention ""squeezed margins"" but don't show specific numbers or trends. They also don't provide company news that could indicate a positive outlook beyond their product developments."
2015-10-04,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, I'm given a set of tweets that are all about stock symbols like DJIA, SPX, etc., but they're just a bunch of random abbreviations and symbols without any context or details. My task is to analyze these tweets to determine if the stock price is going to go up (Positive), stay the same (Neutral), or down (Negative). The output needs to be one of those three tags.

First, I need to remember the steps outlined in the solving process. So, for each tweet, I have to separate positive and negative factors, assess the sentiment towards investors, and then combine that information to see the overall impact on the stock price.

But wait, looking at the tweets provided here, they seem pretty random with various abbreviations and symbols. It's like just a list of stock names without any context or actual content. That makes me think that these are probably not meaningful investment recommendations because they don't provide any information about specific stocks. They might be typos or placeholders.

So, if I were analyzing such tweets, the first step would be to recognize that none of them offer relevant information about a particular stock. Each tweet is just listing symbols without explaining what each one stands for or how it relates to the stock price.

Since there's no context or analysis done on any of these tweets, I can't assess their sentiment towards investors. They might just be random messages without any business value. 

Given that none of them provide meaningful insights into a specific stock, my conclusion would probably be that the impact is neutral because there's no information to determine if it'll go up or down.

I should make sure not to overcomplicate this. The tweets don't seem to offer any useful data points, so they can't affect the stock price predictably. It's like a set of random facts without context. Therefore, the overall sentiment for each tweet would be neutral since there are no positive, negative, or neutral factors provided.

So, when I come up with my conclusion, it should reflect that none of these tweets provide any relevant information about a specific stock, making their impact on the price neutral."
2015-10-05,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. The user provided six tweets and wants me to conclude whether they're positive, neutral, or negative. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the process: identify the stock symbol, then break down each tweet into factors, assess sentiment, and combine them for an overall conclusion.

Looking at the first tweet: ""m & amp ; a daily : paving way for apple car ? URL $ amzn $ amZN $ atcey $ avgo $ bhi $ brcm $ cam $ chs $ cvc $ exc $ fdx $ gm $ goog $ googl $ hal."" This seems to be unrelated, mentioning Apple, but not directly related to Amazon. Probably no impact.

Second tweet: ""option millionaires : jdp 2000 : $ amzn price action last week URL."" Again, talking about millionaires and stock prices, which might influence investor sentiment. Not sure if it's positive or negative, just speculative.

Third tweet: ""rt AT_USER what's the probability that $ amzn is below $550 in 11 days ? dailyfactoid URL."" This tweet requests a prediction. It sounds like it's trying to get information but isn't clear how it affects Amazon's stock price. Maybe neutral if they don't have relevant data or sentiment.

Fourth tweet: ""almost forgot ; result of last trade ( $ fb $ amzn $ goog $ nflx $ blk $ lnkd tweeted ... ) $ googl entry 661.67 closed 672 . … URL."" This mentions recent trades and company entries, possibly affecting investor expectations. It seems like positive sentiment as they might see gains.

Fifth tweet: ""rt williamj 54 : weekend review 10/2 / 15 : $ amzn $ lgih $ dhi $ cmg $ fb $ mbly $ panw $ googl $ ew $ fltx $ crm $ skx $ fit $ dy v … URL."" This is a reply to a tweet. It's about a review and mentions specific companies, but I don't have context on what the user meant by ""paving way for apple car."" Not sure if it's positive or negative.

Sixth tweet: ""$ amzn $ googl $ fb $ nflx all “ early out ” last week and continue to lead URL."" This suggests that Amazon has been 'early out,' which might imply a lack of confidence in the stock. But I don't have specific data on that sentiment.

Putting it together, tweets 4 and 6 are likely positive if they show good performance or expectations. Tweet 5 is speculative without clear context. Tweets 1-3 seem too unrelated to Amazon's stock. So overall, positive because tweet 4 shows a strong position."
2015-10-06,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price and determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

Starting with tweet 1: It lists top stocks but doesn't mention anything about Amazon. So probably not affecting much here.

Tweet 2 is a retweet, so no info there either. Maybe just replying to something else.

Tweet 3 is another retweet. Again, no specific content related to Amazon.

Tweet 4 talks about Ascent Solar Technologies and mentions trade ideas but doesn't touch on Amazon or its stock directly.

Tweet 5 discusses a free trial and momentum plays, but again, no mention of Amazon or its stock price.

Tweet 6 says that Google is looking for an investment. While it's talking about Google, does this mean anything specific? Maybe indicating some interest in Google, which could be a positive sign because it might attract investors. However, the context is more about Google's financials than Amazon itself.

Tweet 7 also mentions Google and its performance but doesn't provide any specific data or action related to Amazon.

Tweet 8 talks about a free trial and asks for an analysis of AMZN stock. This could be a request from someone thinking about buying AMZN. It might signal positive expectations, which could boost the stock price.

Tweet 9 discusses fuel surcharges for e-commerce firms but again, no mention of Amazon or its stock. 

So overall, the most relevant tweet is number 8 where there's a question about AMZN stock, which could be a lead to increase the stock price. But I'm not sure if it's enough to determine positive or neutral because other tweets are just retweets and questions without specific action.

But considering that one of the tweets asks about AMZN stock directly, which might prompt investors' attention and buy interest, it leans towards a positive impact on Amazon."
2015-10-07,Neutral,"Alright, let's analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of Amazon. 

1. **First Tweet:** It mentions the URL for AMZN and suggests trends in SMBS related to Google's search power. This is more about user insights rather than specific news or positive indicators.

2. **Second Tweet:** Users are talking about SEO strategies, specifically mentioning $AMZN. However, there's some negative sentiment with quotes indicating dissatisfaction, which might be due to market reactions but not direct positive information.

3. **Third Tweet:** Again, it's about a product launch of $AMZN and questioning if the current URL is relevant. This doesn't provide any significant data or news related to AMZN performance.

4. **Fourth Tweet:** Provides some stock metrics but doesn't contain any positive or negative language. It lists price changes for multiple companies, which are just numbers without context.

5. **Fifth Tweet:** Similar to the fourth, discussing marketing strategies and comparing to SMBS. No positive info here.

6. **Sixth Tweet:** Talks about a video showing an AMZN roadblock. This could imply that users think AMZN is underperforming or performing poorly in their context. It might lead to negative sentiment if perceived as unsuitable for stock trading.

7. **Seventh Tweet:** Offers opinions on Amazon banning Google sales, which is unrelated to the company's performance and more about market speculation. No direct information about stock price impact.

8. **Eighth Tweet:** Lists various companies under AMZN with metrics but no positive context or analysis. Doesn't provide any insights into the stock's direction.

After reviewing all tweets, none of them directly mention AMZN's financial performance, recent earnings, news events affecting its stock, or any type of positive information that could influence investor sentiment positively. All are either user suggestions, comments on users' experiences with AMZN, or speculative opinions without actual data. Therefore, the overall sentiment is neutral."
2015-10-08,Negative,"Okay, so I need to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price and decide if they're positive, neutral, or negative. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet talks about prepping for the next season and mentions several companies like Apple, Google, and others, but it doesn't mention anything related to Amazon. So probably no impact from this one.

2. The second tweet mentions that Amazon is looking to dive into another market with ""amazon handmade,"" specifically referring to Etsy. It says shares dropped 4% on news about that. That's a significant drop, so negative sentiment.

3. The third tweet continues talking about investors in disruptive tech making large profits and mentions AMZN being a big player. No direct impact here either.

4. The fourth tweet is about Amazon's market recap and stock update from October 7, 2015. It doesn't mention changes or anything related to the stock price yet, so no immediate effect.

5. Fifth tweet says Amazon flexed in the online handmade goods market. That sounds like a positive trend, possibly leading to some positive news about Amazon's business performance.

6. Sixth tweet mentions Amazon diving into another market with ""amazon handmade"" and specifically notes shares dropping 4% on that news. This is similar to tweet number two but more specific, so also negative impact.

7. Seventh tweet discusses investors in disruptive tech making large profits. While it doesn't mention the stock, it's talking about other factors that could affect Amazon, which might have a neutral effect.

8. Eighth tweet talks about e-commerce companies with ""s suddenly"" potential and mentions $emc and vz bonds. Doesn't directly relate to Amazon's stock, so no impact here either.

9. Ninth tweet is similar to the first one; it seems like prepping for a season but doesn't mention anything about Amazon or its stock.

10. Tenth tweet discusses a high-yield corporate bond fund, specifically mentioning Amzn and other names. Again, no mention of the stock itself, so no direct impact.

Now, combining all these thoughts: The first few tweets are speculative about Amazon's future without any actual data. The fifth and sixth tweets report specific market movements that could affect sentiment positively or negatively. The rest don't provide enough information about Amazon's performance or other factors affecting it. There's some positive news from the market but with no concrete evidence. So, overall, the positive tweet reports good news in the marketplace, negative for direct stock drops, and neutral regarding other unrelated factors.

I think the strongest signals are the fifth and sixth tweets where shares drop 4%, which is a significant movement downward. However, since it's speculative without any actual data on Amazon's performance or others, I might lean towards some positive impact because it's good to be in the market. But I'm not sure if that's sufficient. The overall sentiment seems mixed but leans slightly positive based on the specific news."
2015-10-09,Positive,"Okay, so I need to determine the likely impact on Amazon's stock price based on the provided tweets. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock from each tweet. It looks like ""amzn"" is consistently mentioned in all tweets, which is a good start. Now, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors.

Looking at the first tweet: it talks about a website portal related to artisans on Etsy. That doesn't seem directly relevant to Amazon's stock performance, so maybe this tweet has no impact or neutral sentiment.

Next, tweet 2 mentions FV filing details but seems unrelated since the focus is on stock market updates and companies. So, probably neutral again.

Tweet 3 talks about savers all possibly long AMZN in their accounts. This could be positive as investors might be concerned about earnings or something else related to AMZN's future. But I'm not sure if that directly affects the stock price.

Tweet 4 is a trading message with some random symbols and mentions of trading pennystocks, which I think refers to short-term trading strategies. Not relevant to AMZN performance.

Tweet 5 discusses market cap but talks about market resources, which again doesn't impact AMZN's price.

Tweet 6 mentions dividend updates for AMZN and other companies like TLT and JBLU. Dividend payments usually indicate good news as they can boost investor confidence, so positive sentiment here.

Tweet 7 talks about financials and stock prices from companies related to Amazon. The mention of stocks and their valuations could affect Amazon's valuation, but I'm not sure if it's a direct impact on the price.

Tweet 8 is another dividend update for AMZN, which seems similar to tweet 6, reinforcing positive sentiment.

Tweet 9 discusses a dividend and mentions Apple services; again, dividends can influence stock prices. So, slight positive here too.

Tweet 10 talks about a dividend for BTU, but I'm not sure if that's related to AMZN or netflix. Maybe just a minor distraction.

Tweet 11 mentions using $537.66 as an expense on Etsy, which doesn't seem directly connected to Amazon.

Tweet 12 is a stock update from Netflix, Facebook, and Amazon; the focus seems too broad and not specific enough for AMZN impact.

Tweet 13 talks about a large purchase at an auction price for $537.66, but this might be more about financials than stock performance.

Tweet 14 mentions dividend growth expectations for Google, FB, NFLX, and Amazon over the next two days. Positive expectations can lead to higher stock prices as investors wait for dividends, so positive sentiment here too.

Tweet 15 talks about a daily earnings meeting, which affects company performance but doesn't directly tie into AMZN's stock price unless it's related to their operations.

Now, considering all these tweets, I notice some are neutral or slightly positive. However, tweet 6 and 7 both mention dividend payments for AMZN, which could indicate that the stock might have some upside potential. But other tweets like 14 predict positive growth, which could drive prices up further. The overall sentiment seems mixed but leaning towards a slight positive because multiple cues point to potential gains from dividends and future investments.

Wait, but I should be cautious not to overinterpret too much. It's possible that these are just diversification efforts or unrelated. So, considering all the factors, perhaps the stock is expected to have some positive movement due to dividend expectations."
2015-10-10,Neutral,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on the stock price of a company. I'm not entirely sure about all these terms, but I'll take it step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol is tricky because none are provided in the tweet. Hmm, maybe I should focus more on the factors mentioned instead? The first tweet mentions ""spx"" which probably stands for S&P 500, and other small cap stocks like $qqq (QQQ), $nflx (NFLX). Then there's a weekly post link.

The second tweet talks about being ready for a buy signal with several stock symbols. It also lists some futures contracts, FB, PANW, etc., which I think are different from the S&P.

Third tweet has iJS, MEC, AMZN, WMT (Warriors), and others like NASDAQ. So it's a mix of stocks here as well.

I'm not sure what each symbol represents. If it's about the stock prices of these specific companies, then this tweet is likely suggesting that investors should buy certain stocks, which could impact their valuations. 

The next steps are to separate positive and negative factors for each tweet. But without knowing if they're positive or negative, I can't assess sentiment directly.

Then there's an overall sentiment summary where I combine these analyses. If the tweets are all about buying signals or suggesting certain stocks, that might be a positive sign because it could signal confidence in certain sectors.

I'm also wondering why there are multiple symbols mentioned across different tweets. Maybe some are more recent than others? It might indicate a mix of current and future movements affecting the stock prices.

But without knowing the actual stock prices or their performance, it's hard to say if these are positive, neutral, or negative impacts. I think the key here is that the tweet seems to suggest investor action based on buy signals, which could be seen as positive because it might indicate confidence in future growth, but I'm not entirely sure.

So, putting it all together, considering the buy signals and the suggestion to watch a stock list, this tweet suggests that there's interest in certain stocks, which could lead investors to react positively or neutrally. However, without more context on current market conditions or other factors, it's hard to pin down exactly. I'll go with [Neutral] because the information presented doesn't give clear evidence of positive or negative sentiment."
2015-10-11,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets about the stock prices for Amzn and other companies. The first tweet is about a free mobile app, which seems unrelated to stock prices. It's promoting a tool but not directly talking about stock performance.

The second tweet mentions building a bulletproof portfolio using several stocks: AT_USER, fb, crox, etc., all of which are listed on the NYSE. This suggests that someone is suggesting investing in these companies, which could indicate potential for increased stock prices. However, since it's not an official message or analysis, I'm unsure if this constitutes a positive or negative signal.

I don't have any additional context or information about Amzn's performance. The user is focusing on building their own portfolio, so without knowing how that might affect the broader market or individual company valuations, it's hard to assess the impact on stock prices. It's more of a speculative investment suggestion rather than an actual recommendation for stocks.

Therefore, based on limited information about Amzn's performance and the content of these tweets, I can't determine if there's a positive, neutral, or negative impact on the stock price."
2015-10-12,Negative,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me start by looking at each tweet one by one.

The first tweet mentions $ nflx breaking a price target of 113.50 in several platforms and talks about potential future price movements. It's talking about past performance metrics, which might indicate investor confidence or analysis on the stock's growth prospects.

The second tweet lists several stocks with earnings reports for October and refers to a URL for more information. While it mentions earnings, it doesn't provide specific details that would suggest positive or negative sentiment towards a particular stock yet. It's more of an overview.

The third tweet offers a discount offer targeting favorite Nasdaq stocks by joining their email list. This could potentially attract investment interest if the stock is undervalued and expected to rise in value.

The fourth tweet talks about potential future trends, specifically mentioning getting past 580 heading into this upcoming month. If the stock is expected to increase significantly, it could be a positive indicator for investors who anticipate growth.

The fifth tweet mentions Amazon (AMZN) stepping up its price above a resistance level of 548.27. This could indicate that support exists or momentum is building if the stock hits higher levels, which might push the price further upwards.

The sixth tweet is an update on AMZN's stock performance and mentions it will be moving towards breakout over a triple resistance area. A double resistance can sometimes act as a trigger for further movement, suggesting potential for a positive trend.

The seventh tweet again talks about NFLX triggering a sell in several platforms. While selling could indicate concerns about the stock, it might also signal that there's fear or lack of confidence among investors, which could be seen as negative if they expect higher prices.

The eighth tweet mentions QQQ breaking 106.45 points in various platforms and talks about past performance metrics for NFLX. It seems similar to the first tweet but focuses on QQQ instead, which is a different stock entirely, so its impact would need to be considered separately.

Putting it all together, several tweets are discussing future price movements or earnings reports, while others offer direct discounts or mentions of specific stocks. These could indicate investor sentiment towards the company, possibly driven by potential growth prospects or fear of lower valuations. However, without concrete data on performance trends or analyst comments, it's challenging to determine a clear overall trend. There might be some positive indicators like the price targets being broken and expected breakout levels, but these are speculative.

I think the best conclusion here is that there's some underlying confidence in potential growth, which could make the stock seem positive, especially if such expectations are backed by analyst reports or media coverage. But without direct support or confirmation of past performance metrics for any specific stock, it's a bit ambiguous."
2015-10-13,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll look for the target stock symbol in each tweet. The first tweet has ""eurusd"" which might be related to EUR/USD or other currency pairs. But since it's just a list without a specific stock symbol, maybe I need to consider that as an oversight and focus on more relevant tweets.

Looking at the other tweets: 

1. The next three are about Amazon (AMZN), Apple TV+, and others. These seem like news related to stock performance or upcoming launches. However, without context on how these might affect AMZN's stock price, it's hard to assess the sentiment directly.

2. Then there are multiple mentions of Transformers being released. This is a big deal in tech and could boost the stock, but I don't know if that's positive or negative. It's more speculative.

3. The tweet about Imax, which is a movie streaming service, announcing its 25th anniversary might be seen as a positive sign for growth, especially if fans are excited about the content. However, again, without context on how this impacts AMZN, it's unclear.

4. Another mention of Transformers being released could be positive but speculative since Transformers isn't an equity company. The sentiment is uncertain here.

5. The Imax news likely affects the movie streaming industry, which might have some ripple effects beyond just AMZN. It could positively influence growth stocks indirectly, contributing to a positive sentiment.

6. A mention of IMAX's top 25 stars doesn’t directly impact AMZN, but it might affect the market as it could drive investment in tech companies that rely on content like IMAX. This is speculative and uncertain.

7. Reaching out to AT_USER’s linkedin post about Amazon could be positive if they're making the company more attractive or showing growth. But without knowing AT_USER's intent, it's hard to predict AMZN's impact.

8. The Amazon Web Services adding an upside despite stretched valuations sounds like a positive news for their stock. Stretched valuations usually indicate potential growth, so this could be seen as a good signal for AMZN or its competitors.

Putting it all together: There are speculative tweets about Transformers and IMAX which might provide some boost to tech stocks. The positive note from AWS adding upside suggests that the company's performance is improving. However, without knowing if these factors directly affect a specific stock, I can't definitively label this as Positive, Neutral, or Negative. But collectively, the sentiment leans towards positive because of these positive signals and potential effects on growth stocks."
2015-10-14,Negative,"Okay, let me try to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. First, I need to look at each tweet and see what it says. 

Starting with tweet 1, there are several companies mentioned like Panw, pennystocks, petroleo, etc., but none specific about Amazon. Similarly, tweet 2 is repeating the same thing without adding much information.

Looking at tweet 3, I see a few stock prices and mentions of different stocks. It talks about $ qqq hft algos broke 106.20 in some platforms. Hmm, not sure what that means. Maybe it's a typo or incorrect data? 

Tweet 4 is about energy companies, so again, no info on Amazon.

Tweets 5 to 7 discuss Amazon and other companies like WMT. It says ""rt AT_USER wal-mart trumps amzn"" which suggests Wal-Mat is against Amazon. But I'm not sure how this affects the stock price yet.

Tweet 8 mentions that WMT has higher profits compared to AMZN, but it's a negative note about AMZN.

Tweets 9 and 10 talk about wage raises for pepsi and mention robots on AMZN. It could indicate Amazon is being affected by corporate actions, but not sure if positive or negative.

Tweet 11 is from Alibaba, mentioning scaling cloud services in the U.S., which might be a positive sign for Amazon as well.

Tweet 12 talks about WMT going to its 3-year lows to buy AMZN at their lifetime highs. That sounds like a squeeze on AMZN because if WMT lowers their price, it can drive demand up.

Tweet 13 says that AMZN's market cap is under $200B and WMT is not even a contest anymore. So, this suggests that AMZN is doing well, which could be positive for the company.

Tweets 14 mention an opinion piece on discounting Amazon if Alibaba comes out. If they're skeptical about discounts, it might decrease Amazon's stock price.

Tweet 15 talks about micron technology, but again, not sure how relevant that is to Amazon unless there's a correlation.

Now, compiling all this: AMZN seems to be doing well according to some tweets, like tweet 3 and 13. There are negative points in others, like tweet 4 comparing profits but negative on AMZN. WMT is being squeezed, which could hurt them, but that affects other companies as well.

Overall sentiment seems mixed because while there are positive points about AMZN doing well, there's also negative mentions of competitors and maybe some investor reactions based on corporate actions. I'm not entirely sure if the positive tweets outweigh the negatives, so it might be a mix, but leaning towardsneutral or negative."
2015-10-15,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on twtr's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet mentions several symbols and a URL. It doesn't provide any information that directly affects the company or its future performance. So, probably neutral.

2. Second tweet also has multiple symbols but seems like it could be related to energy or commodities, which might have some impact on the stock, especially if energy prices rise. But not sure about the overall sentiment yet.

3. Third tweet talks about filing updates, which is a minor event and unlikely to significantly affect twtr's stock price. So still neutral.

4. Fourth tweet mentions FNBX, which I'm not familiar with as an index or ETF. It could be a random mention; no significant info here.

5. Fifth tweet discusses options trading, where the stock has seen larger changes before. While it might trigger some trades, it's speculative and probably doesn't have a major impact on the price yet.

6. Sixth tweet introduces Harmony Gold, which is a mining company. If they report earnings, that could positively affect twtr's stock. But unless the information comes out soon, I'm not sure about the overall sentiment.

7. Seventh tweet talks about a large trade in shares, but without details on how it affects the stock price, it's hard to say. Not enough info.

8. Eighth tweet is just a number and mentions Amzn and other indices, no real impact mentioned.

9. Ninth tweet introduces whale purchases from Sacerdote, which could increase investor interest or sentiment, but not significant enough for the stock to change much.

10. Tenth tweet again talks about FNBX and stock performance, similar to tweet 4; speculative trading without concrete info.

So overall, most tweets are either minor events or unrelated to the stock. The big one is the large trade in shares on tweet 7, which could lead some investors but not enough to tip the balance."
2015-10-16,Positive,"Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a list of tweets and wants to determine their impact on a stock's future price. They've also specified using only [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative] as the possible responses.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""mnga magnegas corp . volume URL $ mnga $ p $ amzn $ amzn mnga invest trade ideas."" It seems like the stock symbol is ""amzn"" or ""mnga"". Similarly, the next tweet mentions ""spy"", which I know is SPY, a popular ETF. The third tweet is about ""amzn inc."", so ""amzn"".

Next, for each tweet, I have to separate positive and negative factors. Positive factors are straightforward: any wording that suggests good news or recommendations. Negative might include warnings or potential issues.

I'll go through each tweet:

1. mnga tweet mentions volume, which is a positive factor.
2. spy tweet talks about investors saving with cash back, which seems beneficial.
3. amzn tweets discuss stocks and price movements; some are neutral, others seem positive.

Then, assess the sentiment of each tweet. The first tweet is supportive, the second is also in favor of the stock, and the third shows mixed but mostly favorable.

Overall, all factors point to a positive outlook on amzn stocks. So, combining these, the overall sentiment should be positive."
2015-10-17,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price for the given company. 

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""packing to return to nyc & & discussing ghc 15 sweg with AT_USER $ goog $ aapl $ msft $ amzn 💎 🎉 💸 ✨ 📈 💯 💖 swag 4swag URL"". Hmm, I'm not sure about the exact stock symbol here. Maybe it's ""GOOGL""? Because that's a well-known company on the stock market.

Next tweet: ""earnings next week : oct . 19 : $ ibm $ ms oct . 20 : $ cmg $ yhoo oct . 21 : $ axp $ ebay $ emc $ gm oct . 22 : $ amzn $ googl $ lly … URL"". Again, not sure about the stock symbol. It seems like it's talking about earnings for several companies: IBM, Microsoft, Amazon, etc.

Third tweet: ""rt AT_USER URL covers all your favorite nasdaq stocks - join our email list today - $ aapl , $ fb , $ amzn URL""

Okay, so now I'm trying to figure out the stock symbol. If it's about earnings next week for companies like IBM, Microsoft, Amazon, etc., then maybe the target stock is one of these. But without more context, it's hard to tell.

Assuming that each tweet might be related to a different stock. So if I have three tweets, and each could be affecting a different company or possibly the same company.

Looking at the first tweet, it mentions ""GOOGL"" from ""goog $ googl"". Then the second one talks about earnings for companies like AMZN and AMAGAN, etc. The third tweet is again covering several stocks: APLX, FB, AMZN, etc., probably other tech stocks.

Without knowing exactly which stock each tweet refers to, it's hard to assess the overall sentiment. But if these tweets are all about earnings reports or market updates for different companies, it might be a mix of positive and negative factors because they could be showing improving or downperforming quarters.

I'm not sure if ""sweg"" is a known term here; maybe that's just some kind of casual mention. The fact remains unclear without knowing the exact stock.

If each tweet was about different stocks, perhaps indicating varied market conditions affecting their performance. But it's hard to conclude whether this is positive or negative overall because I don't know how each company's earnings are doing relative to others.

Wait, maybe ""sweg"" could be a typo or slang for something else, but without context, I can't be certain. So, given the uncertainty around which stock each tweet refers to and the lack of specific data on performance, it's challenging to assign a sentiment label."
2015-10-18,Negative,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how these tweets are affecting Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First tweet says $amzn is the new $nflx after stealing their TV show. That sounds a bit strange and probably not relevant for Amazon's performance. Maybe it's a joke or something, so I'll note that as maybe not important.

Second tweet mentions AT_USER saying there are pricing moves of 7.53% on earnings, but the options market is underpriced by 8 quarters. Hmm, that sounds technical and relates to stock options trading. It could influence investor sentiment but perhaps not directly related to Amazon's main business or growth potential.

Third tweet says they'll split $amzn soon. Splitting a company usually means it's about debt restructuring or changes in financial structure, which might affect readers' views on the company’s future prospects. So that's something to consider, but I'm not sure if it's positive or negative yet.

Fourth tweet repeats the same point as the third one with a typo. No change there, so probably still affecting investor sentiment.

Fifth tweet lists multiple companies like Amzn, GooGl, IBM, Aal, etc., mentioning earnings are up. This could be about the company's performance in various markets and might lead to positive news for Amazon if their earnings are good. But I'm not sure how this relates to Amazon specifically or overall the market.

Sixth tweet mentions vz shares, Westmoreland Coal Co., GM, VZ stocks investing, and some exchange details. This seems like it could be about company news, possibly affecting investor interest in the stock. The term 'invest' might imply a lack of investment activity, which could affect sentiment negatively if people are looking away from Amazon.

Seventh tweet lists vz shares again with more details. Similar to the sixth tweet's content, but same issue as before; it might be about company news that impacts investor sentiment.

Now, summarizing each tweet's impact: The first is irrelevant. The second technical and may have minor effect. The third and fourth are splitting, which could change reader views but not directly on Amazon. The fifth mentions earnings up, which might boost investor confidence if the earnings report is positive. However, there's a lot of other companies listed, so it might be broader than just Amazon.

Sixth tweet: vz stocks, investing, which could imply less interest in Amazon or people looking elsewhere, possibly negative.

Seventh tweet: same content as sixth but again, different context but similar effect on investor sentiment if they think others are focusing away.

Putting it all together, the tweets mention AMZN earnings and other companies' stocks. While some of them might indicate positive news (like fifth), there's a lot of other information out there that could be negative or neutral. The overall impact is not clear-cut because it depends on how quickly people start to adjust their views based on these unrelated company news items.

I'm leaning towards a mix of positive and negative, but since the primary focus is on AMZN earnings, which might give some upward momentum, I think there's an element of uncertainty. So maybe [Neutral] would be appropriate."
2015-10-19,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company based on the given information. The user has provided 10 tweets, and each seems to be related to different factors affecting BABA stock.

First, let's break down each tweet one by one. Each tweet gives either positive or negative keywords related to BABA. My task is to assess how these keywords might influence investor sentiment towards the stock.

Starting with tweet 1: ""stock showdown : $ baba vs . $ amzn ; which is a better buy ? URL"". This seems like a comparison tweet, so it's likely neutral because it doesn't directly mention buying or selling but offers insight into potential investments. I think this could be positive as it might influence the company's valuation.

Tweet 2: ""$ vz $ ko $ amzn : what to watch in the stock market this week : URL"". This is about what to watch, which suggests a neutral sentiment because it's giving information about potential future developments that investors are keeping an eye on. It could be a sign of optimism or cautiousness.

Tweet 3: ""rt AT_USER plug inside that forklift would be a gr8 win for $ plug $ amzn URL"". The mention of a successful outcome with a ""gr8"" which I think is translating to ""super win"" in some contexts, indicating a positive outcome. This could boost investor confidence, making it positive.

Tweet 4: ""$ amzn had a big run past few days"". This seems like a negative tweet because it's talking about BABA having a recent good performance, which might indicate downward trends or concerns about management. However, the phrasing ""had a big run"" is ambiguous. It could be interpreted as support from customers or positive news, which would lean towards a positive impact.

Tweet 5: ""rt AT_USER earnings are picking up : $ amzn $ googl $ ibm $ aal $ biib $ ua $ luv $ msft $ gm $ vz $ cmg $ ba $ skx URL"". This tweet lists several companies with positive earnings, which is often seen as a sign of strong economic conditions. Earnings growth can be a good indicator of future performance and stock valuation. So this would likely be positive.

Tweet 6: ""AT_USER wont surprise me to see $ amzn $ 750 - $ 800 . URL"". This seems more neutral or even slight negative because it's just giving an approximate price range, which could be speculative. Investors might react based on expectations versus actual performance, but the wording doesn't provide strong information.

Tweet 7: ""rt AT_USER $ ibm $ sonc $ cmg $ Cree $ vmw $ yhoo $ biib $ ebay $ mlnx $ sndk $ now $ cat $ fcx $ dnkn $ mcd $ p $ googl $ msft $ ftnt $ amzn $ ua URL"". This is another list of positive keywords, indicating a favorable outlook. It could be seen as positive news, suggesting good future prospects.

Tweet 8: ""gain from movement in these buzzing assets $ aapl $ amzn $ googl $ nflx $ rgzpf URL"". This mentions that the stock market is moving due to certain assets, which suggests positive trends and investment opportunities. Positive sentiment could be influenced by this information.

 Tweet 9: ""$ amzn is reporting earnings for q3 2015 on 10/22 / 15 – URL"". The mention of a specific date might indicate confidence or expectation, but without details like financial results or any warnings about problems, it's unclear. It could be seen as positive if the company is performing well.

Tweet 10: ""AT_USER hoi nico . hoe staat de koers $ amzn er momenteel voor ?"". This seems neutral because it's a casual question asking about stock performance without any specific sentiment or information. The wording is unclear, so I think this tweet could be neutral.

Now, let me summarize the analysis:

- Tweets 1: Neutral
- Tweet 2: Neutral (though slightly negative)
- Tweet 3: Positive
- Tweet 4: Positive (interpretation tricky but leaning positive)
- Tweet 5: Positive
- Tweet 6: Neutral or slight negative
- Tweet 7: Positive
- Tweet 8: Positive
- Tweet 9: Could be Positive if earnings are good, Negative otherwise. Since it's a report without specifics, I'm unsure.
- Tweet 10: Neutral

To make it simple, let's consider the majority of tweets that are positive and neutral. Tweets 3,5,7,8 seem to have strong support or optimism. There might be some uncertainty around tweet 9, but given its content, it could add weight to a positive outlook.

So overall sentiment is leaning towards Positive because most tweets indicate good news for BABA."
2015-10-20,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. 

First, I need to extract the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the tweets, the main companies mentioned are Google (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Facebook (FB), General Electric (GE), and others like IBM (IBM) and General Motors (GM). So, for each of these stocks, I'll be evaluating their impact.

For each tweet, I should separate the factors into positive and negative. Then assess the sentiment towards each factor. For example, in tweet 1, it mentions Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Facebook as being tied for second place. That suggests a mix of positive and neutral factors, but perhaps leaning slightly positive if these companies are performing well.

Next, I need to look at the sentiment of each tweet. Some tweets talk about upcoming earnings or company news that could affect stock prices. For instance, tweet 7 mentions option millionaires getting rich in tech stocks based on analyst ratings. This could indicate strong sentiment towards Amazon as they're gaining more stock options, which might be a positive sign.

I should also consider market trends and economic indicators mentioned in the tweets. For example, if there's talk about a crash or an upcoming event like tweet 8 mentioning market crashing and suggesting selling, that would likely lead to negative sentiment for Amazon.

Looking at each tweet one by one:

1. The first tweet talks about Google, Amazon, etc., tying for second place. It might be neutral since it's more of a market overview.
2. Tweet 2 mentions pharma spending but speculates on GM. This could have mixed feelings as some consumers might see positive trends in healthcare companies despite lower earnings.
3.Tweet 3 discusses job creation during the holiday season, which is good for Amazon, boosting their stock price positively.
4. The tweet about AMZN shedding could be neutral or slightly negative if there are specific reasons why they're downgrading.
5. Earnings preview for Q3: 2 and a half months of gains suggest positive earnings expectations.
6. Another mention of AMZN gaining a lot in value, which is definitely positive for sentiment.
7. Option millionaires and analyst ratings indicate strong investor confidence, so this could be very positive.
8. Market crashing with selling calls suggests negative sentiment as investors are probably waiting to sell.
9. Mentioning Google, Facebook's improvement could add another layer of positive news.
10.FB getting up 100% is a significant move and likely adds positive sentiment.
11. IBM, GM, GE, etc., mentioning road forward for big tech suggests sustained growth and support.
12. Companies stopping accepting packages due to online shopping—that might affect consumer behavior but could have some positive effect on Amazon's revenue through e-commerce sales.
13. AMZN receiving a buy rating from analyst could indicate increasing confidence or good news, contributing positively.
14. AMZN creating more jobs in seasonally, which is a strong positive indicator.

Considering all these factors—positive mentions like Q3 earnings and job creation, mixed positive and negative aspects, but with overall market conditions possibly leading to positive sentiment—the stock seems overall positive. The various trends and analyst ratings support the view that AMZN is doing well, so the sentiment should be considered positive."
2015-10-21,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze the given tweets and determine their likely impact on the future stock price of Amazon (AMZN). Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. **First Tweet:** ""mt AT_USER amazon creates 100,000 plus seasonal jobs AMZN"". This sounds positive because it mentions creating jobs, which is generally good for a company's financial health and investor sentiment.

2. **Second Tweet:** ""$ wmt $ amzn URL"". It seems like some exchange rates are being tracked, but without more context on how this affects Amazon's stock price, it's hard to assess the sentiment. Maybe neutral or positive if there's a market reaction.

3. **Third Tweet:** ""current s & p 500 pe ratio : 21.43 $ glen db $ gs $ spy $ ms $ jpm cnbc $ yhoo $ amzn $ cmg $ china $ es $ spxs $ spxl reuters URL"". This seems like a financial analysis tweet about the S&P 500 PE ratio. If the ratio is up, it might indicate that Amazon is performing well relative to others, which could be positive.

4. **Fourth Tweet:** ""bloomberg - starbucks , fiat first in firing line as eu orders tax repayments tax $ sbux $ amzn $ fcau URL"". This seems like a financial announcement about STARBULL's actions related to EU taxes and the Fed. If STARBULL is doing something that benefits Amazon, it might boost AMZN's stock price.

5. **Fifth Tweet:** ""market looks bearish but nothing major . probably waiting for earnings report from the big guys tomorrow ? $ googl $ amzn $ msft"". This suggests that the market is uncertain and focused on upcoming earnings. If AMZN's earnings are good, it could drive positive sentiment.

6. **Sixth Tweet:** ""$ am zn change"" with mentions of S&P 500 PE ratio. Similar to tweet 2, this seems like a financial analysis but without immediate context, it's hard to determine the sentiment impact on Amazon's stock price.

7. **Seventh Tweet:** ""$ nflx fresh lows $ amzn $ googl so tempting here vs $ 550 / $ 670 , hmmmm decisionsdecisions"". This is more of a motivational tweet encouraging investors in NFLX and AMZN, suggesting positive market behavior for both companies.

8. **Eighth Tweet:** ""$ am zn - nielsen reports lower sales , dented by dollar"" mentions lower sales due to the dollar. Lower sales can hurt a company's performance, which might lead to negative sentiment if the stock price drops.

9. **Ninth Tweet:** ""interesting $ amzn vs $ vmw . things are getting cloudy . URL"". This is comparing two stocks, AMZN and VMW. If there's uncertainty or lack of clarity about their relationship, it could affect investor sentiment negatively.

10. **Tenth Tweet:** ""$ am zn inc . change"" with mentions of pharmaceuticals. Positive words might boost Amazon's stock price if they're related to the company's business activities.

11. **Eleventh Tweet:** ""rt AT_USER amzn URL inc . last price URL $ amzn $ xly $ fitx $ gdx amzn stocks invest"". The tweet is a motivational encouraging investors in AMZN and others, suggesting positive outlook for Amazon.

12. **Twelfth Tweet:** ""rt AT_USER jeff bezos lost $ 1 billion tuesday , most among the world's richest , as $ am zn fell 2 % . URL URL"". Jeff Z umb has faced significant financial loss due to a large payout, which can be seen as negative news. This could decrease investor confidence and sentiment.

13. **Thirteenth Tweet:** ""yesterday's picks : “ AT_USER today's forecast : in an up market $ atvi $ am zn $ nvda $ rai will go up” URL"". This seems like a motivational tweet encouraging AMZN to perform well, which could lead to positive sentiment if the stock moves upward.

14. **Fourteenth Tweet:** ""rt AT_USER wall street breakfast : starbucks , fiat stung by tax deals"" mentions STARBULL being affected by U.S. taxes. If STARBULL is doing poorly or facing issues with foreign taxes, it might lower Amazon's stock price negatively.

15. **Fifteenth Tweet:** ""stock rating reaffirmed by wedbush $ amzn URL"". This suggests that AMZN has been recommended for a stock rating or analysis, which could positively influence investor sentiment as companies tend to perform well based on ratings.

16. **Sixteenth Tweet:** ""$ aapl $ am zn"" mentions Apple and Amazon. While there's some confusion about whether the ban is related to hardware sales, if it refers to product launches or partnerships with Apple, it might boost Amazon's performance positively.

After analyzing all these tweets, I notice that AMZN's stock price is influenced by positive tweets like 1, 7, 10, 11, and 15, which are encouraging and optimistic. However, the negative tweet number 8 suggests lower sales due to a dollar drop, which could be a setback. The tweet number 2 and 6 involve financial analysis without immediate market context, so their impact is less clear.

Overall, while there's some positive momentum from AMZN being encouraged by multiple tweets, there are signs of uncertainty from the fourth tweet about STARBULL's actions. This combination might lead to mixed sentiment."
2015-10-22,Negative,"Okay, I need to determine the likely impact on the stock price of the company based on the provided tweets. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

Starting with tweet 1: It mentions an earnings conference call for Google and Amazon, which might indicate a positive trend as earnings are often good indicators of future performance. But other tweets like tweet 2 mention something about cat's Q3 being a driver for stuck shares, which is more negative. I'm not sure how to weigh these conflicting signals yet.

Looking at tweet 2, it says ""could cat's q3 be next driver for stuck shares?"" and mentions several companies including Amazon, Microsoft, etc., but there's confusion about the exact company in question. This suggests that the tweets are vague or ambiguous, making it hard to assess the impact definitively.

Tweets 4 to 10 mention investing in the wrong companies (like AMZN vs GOM), which is clearly negative. These tweets might indicate a lack of research or due diligence, which can lead to poor investment decisions and likely negative sentiment towards the stock.

Tweets 5 mentions Amazon reaching all-time highs, which is positive but again, without more context it's hard to know how this affects the overall market. The term ""could cat's q3 be next driver"" from tweet 2 adds uncertainty.

Tweets 6 and 7 talk about gains in AMZN. Some tweets are clearly positive (like RT $ AMZN HFT), while others mention other stocks but don't specify, making it difficult to determine the overall effect.

Tweets 8 mentions the end of a ""6-month paid off"" period for Facebook, which could be negative if they think Facebook's performance is over, but without context, it's hard to know. The use of ""paid off"" might imply short-term success rather than long-term impact.

Tweets 9 and 10 are about gains in AMZN compared to other stocks. Positive, but again, vague information might not capture the broader market trend.

Tweets 11 is a simple positive note about AMZN being all-time highs, which could be seen as a short-term boost but doesn't address future developments.

Tweets 12 and 13 mention AMZN's gains and other companies like MSFT. Positive mentions of increases, suggesting potential growth or support for the stock.

Tweets 14 to 25 are about AMZN's earnings reports, with many tweets confirming positive performance (like a 10% increase) and mentioning specifics such as Facebook or Amazon. This could indicate that the company is performing well, which might be a sign of positive future trends.

But there are also negative tweets like tweet 6 and 24 about cat's earnings being beaten, which could lead to skepticism. However, these are more about specific companies rather than the overall stock.

Tweets 30 mentions AMZN as part of several winners with competitors, suggesting potential support among investors but not necessarily a trend for all shares.

Finally, tweet 31 talks about European stocks leading before ECB's conference call, which might be speculative and could impact the global market. However, it's unclear how this affects a specific company unless it relates to AMZN.

Overall, there are conflicting signals: positive tweets about earnings and stock support but negative ones about other companies or investor sentiment. The lack of clarity in some tweets makes it hard to determine a clear overall sentiment on AMZN's future performance."
2015-10-23,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to respond to this query. So, the user provided a text and asked for an analysis ending with a specific tag: [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, I need to understand what the text is about. It's talking about stock market trends, earnings reports, and some personal opinions from people like Jeff Bezo, Amazon, and others. The focus seems to be on positive developments for Amazon, with their shares rising, and mentions of the tech industry doing well. There are also some negative comments about other companies but they seem more about specific points in time rather than a general trend.

I should read through each paragraph carefully to see if there's any overall positive or negative sentiment. The text does mention several positive aspects like Amazon's earnings, their growth, and the expectation for tech companies. But then it also brings up some negatives with other stocks and mentions of 'twtr myth' which don't make much sense in that context.

Overall, while there are positive points, especially around Amazon and the tech sector, there are also some negative comments about other companies. However, those seem more like minor or recent events rather than a dominant trend. So, it's balanced but leaning towards positive because of the significant earnings and market movements for Amazon and others focused on tech.

I need to make sure my conclusion uses one of the tags exactly. Since there are positive points but also some negatives, I should choose [Neutral] as that seems to capture the balance, indicating a lack of strong overall sentiment."
2015-10-24,Neutral,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price from [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet talks about betting against Amazon because it mentions URL and some typos. It seems like they're expressing uncertainty about their future direction, which could be a bit of a negative outlook. But I'm not entirely sure if that's positive or neutral yet.

2. The second tweet is all about trends in the S&P 500: AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, SPX, APLC, GSPC. It mentions the highest point in 10 weeks and talks about ""best / worst"" performers. That's pretty broad and gives general information without specific guidance or concern. Maybe this is a neutral piece of information.

3. The third tweet is more of a straightforward offer, just $AMZN and $IBM. No positive or negative language here, so probably not affecting the stock in any significant way.

4. This one mentions money strategies for daily traders preparing for a day with posts about S&P 500, SPX, APM, GOG, etc. Again, it's offering advice without any words indicating optimism or pessimism.

5. The fourth tweet is about weekly market reports and the stock prices of several companies: $HOH, $VZ, $YOO, $BKD, $GMR, $GM, $AXP, $EBA, $MSFT, $AMZN, $GOOG, $T, $AAU. It's a summary of market reports and individual stock prices without any positive or negative language.

6. The fifth tweet is about a recap for the same companies listed in tweet 4: AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, SKX, VRX. Again, just providing market info without any sentiment keywords.

7. This tweet is about AWS's operating income and comparing it to Amazon's North American E-commerce business. It mentions that Amazon's earnings matched its entire NA E-commerce business. That's a factual statement that doesn't suggest positive or negative trends.

8. The eighth tweet lists 10 companies focusing on boosting their bottom line using AMZN, AMZ, CNK. This is about potential strategies without any sentiment indicators.

9. The ninth tweet says that Amazon has hit its all-time high and mentions the chart guiding it. It's reinforcing positive news, which could be a good signal for investors to buy more.

10. The tenth tweet talks about weekly stock market sentiment scans, but without any specific analysis or words indicating whether people are happy or worried. It’s just presenting data without context.

11. This tweet mentions assets rising in tweets, specifically mentioning APM and DJIA. It's providing information that could be useful for investors but doesn't indicate positive or negative intentions.

Putting it all together, the main positive piece is the last tweet about Amazon hitting its high, which should positively impact investor sentiment. However, other tweets are just informational without any strong sentiment."
2015-10-25,Positive,"Okay, so I have to analyze these tweets to figure out if they're positive, neutral, or negative for Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

First, identify the target stock symbol. Looking at the tweets, some mention ""amzn,"" which is the ticker for Amazon, and others might be from different companies. I'll focus on the relevant ones with ""amzn"" in them because that's the one we're interested in.

Alright, starting with tweet 1: ""$ fb $ googl $ spx $ spy $ study $ hd $ mcd $ amzn $ amazon $ msft $ xom $ ms $ cat"". That seems like it's listing various stock symbols. No clear mention of Amazon here, so maybe this is just a list or irrelevant.

Tweet 2: ""vxx ipath s & p 500 vix short-term futures etn ex-div date URL $ vxx $ amzn $ vxx $ rwm vxx stockmarket invest"". This tweet seems to be about the VIX index and Amazon's stock. The part about ""vxx"" appears multiple times, which is a known term for the VIX. It mentions ex-divide date and stock trading volume, which could affect sentiment. But I'm not sure if this adds much on its own.

Tweet 3: ""URL receives buy rating from goldman sachs $ amzn url acn"". This one has ""url"" in there, maybe a typo or placeholder for Amazon's website. It says they're receiving a buy rating from GSBI, which is a big company. Buy ratings usually indicate positive sentiment towards the stock because investors think it's undervalued.

Tweet 4: ""$ amzn : url “ buy ” rating reaffirmed at wedbush ( amzn ): url"". Same structure here, just adding another buy rating confirmation. This reinforces their position on Amazon and likely contributes to a positive sentiment among investors who are waiting for the stock price performance.

Tweet 5: ""citigroup inc . raises URL price target to $ 700.00 $ amzn URL acn"". Here we go, citigroup is raising their price target for Amazon. Price targets can influence investor sentiment as it affects their expectations about future earnings and growth potential. Raising the target could indicate optimism or caution.

Tweet 6: ""rt AT_USER earnings alert : amazon q3 eps $ 0.17 vs . ( $ 0.13 ) est . ; q3 revs . $ 25.36 b vs . $ 24.91 b est . • $ amzn quote : url"". This one mentions Amazon's quarterly earnings results and a comparison to their estimates. The EPS is slightly up from last year, which could be positive news about profitability or growth. The revenue numbers are up too, which might indicate confidence in the company's performance.

Tweet 7: ""$ amzn : url inc . ( nasdaq : amzn ) shares flying high following … : url"". This looks like a summary of Amazon's stock price movement. It says they're ""inc."" which means the stock is increasing, and their NASDAQ share prices are going up. Positive price movements typically indicate positive sentiment.

Putting it all together: The first tweet is just information without sentiment. Tweets 2 to 7 focus on factors that could influence Amazon's stock—like VIX, earnings, price targets, etc.—but none of these seem contradictory. They seem more like supporting the company's position rather than anything negative. There are some buy ratings and price target increases, which can indicate investor confidence.

So overall, the sentiment is positive because several factors point to Amazon's favorable outlook, including potential stock performance, earnings, and buy ratings."
2015-10-26,Neutral,"Alright, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually.

First tweet talks about both Google and Amazon closing well but mentions an eps gap. That might not directly affect investor sentiment much since it's more about financials than stock performance.

Second tweet lists several companies, including APMEX and others. It doesn't mention any positive or negative developments, so I'm unsure how this affects the stock price.

Third tweet seems to be a link where AT_USER is preparing for support. That could indicate investor confidence but without specific sentiment data, it's hard to tell if it's positive or negative.

Fourth tweet discusses the impact of central banks on the S&P 500 and mentions specific stocks like SPY, MSFT, FB, SPXL, APPL, BA, AMZN, PG. This suggests a negative outlook but again, without more context, I can't assess the sentiment.

Fifth tweet is about Amazon's price going up relative to Google. If one company is performing better than another, it might influence investor sentiment towards the group, potentially adding some positive impact.

Sixth tweet is about millionaires on Amazon and mentions ""bodacious."" This seems more promotional without affecting stock performance directly.

Overall, while the fifth tweet suggests a possible positive movement because of the price gap, there are other tweets that don't provide actionable information. However, one tweet indicates confidence in stock support, which might be a mixed signal but not conclusive. Without specific sentiment metrics from all relevant tweets, it's challenging to assign a clear overall sentiment as [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]."
2015-10-27,Positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by understanding each step outlined in the solving process.

First, I have to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking through the list, the most common URL is ""amzn,"" which stands for Amazon Inc. So that's my target stock.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one and analyze their factors and sentiment towards Amazon's future stock price.

1. The first tweet says, ""URL rating reaffirmed by canaccord genuity $ amzn URL."" Hmm, the URL is just a placeholder here. It mentions that Amazon's stock rating has been reaffirmed by a company called Canaccord Genuity. This suggests they're confident in their stock performance. So that's definitely a positive factor because confidence usually indicates optimism.

2. The second tweet talks about managers pulling back if today's stocks pulled back from $ googl and $ amzn to -3 for the past three days, but the outlook is still good. It seems like Amazon is being optimistic despite some potential challenges in their past performance. So this could influence investor sentiment positively because they're maintaining a favorable outlook even with some uncertainty.

3. The third tweet mentions short sales are updated on Monday, October 26, 2015, with specific stocks priced at $ fxe $ amzn $ cmg $ hal. It doesn't say anything directly about Amazon's performance or future prospects, but it's part of the general market context. So maybe this is neutral because it's not making a direct claim about Amazon.

4. The fourth tweet says Wedbush boosts EPS estimates for AMZN. Upgrading earnings estimates can be seen as a positive sign because it gives investors more confidence in the company's future performance. That would definitely boost Amazon's stock price positively.

5. The fifth tweet mentions Amzn competing with Amazon cloud services. This competitive aspect might affect Amazon's market share, but if it's about innovation or staying ahead in technology, it could be seen as a positive outlook for Amazon. It shows that the company is doing well within their industry, which is generally good news.

6. The sixth tweet talks about SSSV and $ googl holding, with a hold on $ twtr before Chad mentioned something before er. This seems like market trends affecting stock prices in general. If it's an increase in demand for Amazon due to positive news or weaker GDP, that could push the stock up.

7. The seventh tweet is about my Amzn being held surprisingly despite some words. It feels more like a commentary on sentiment rather than a direct statement about Amazon's performance. Maybe it shows concern but not explicitly negative because it doesn't mention anything bad.

8. The eighth tweet suggests Amzn is eating $ wmt's lunch. That could mean Amzn is gaining market share or getting a competitive advantage, which would be positive news for the stock price.

Now, compiling all these factors:

- Positive: Canaccord Genuity rating reaffirmed (good), Upgrading EPS estimates (good), Cloud services competition (positive outlook), Market demand and stock performance (could affect stock based on trends).

- Neutral: Short sales updates (neutral), No direct mention of Amazon's future prospects.

- Negative: Nothing directly negative here, but the lack of specific negative factors might make it neutral, especially since other tweets are positive enough to tip it in a positive direction.

So overall sentiment is leaning towards positive because there are multiple positive factors. The competitive cloud services aspect and market trends seem to support Amazon's performance."
2015-10-28,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze the impact of these tweets on a given company's stock price. Let me start by looking at each tweet individually and then see if I can come up with an overall sentiment.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from all the tweets. Scanning through them, I notice mentions like ""msft"", ""quant"", and others, which are commonly used for Microsoft. So, I'll consider Microsoft (MSFT) as the target.

Now, going through each tweet one by one:

1. The first tweet talks about the sell activity in several financial stocks, but no specific stock is named. It mentions prices like 24.00 and refers to other companies.
2. Second tweet starts with ""here's why amazon stock holders should start to worry,"" which seems to target Amazon (AMZN).
3. Third tweet repeats similar stuff as the first one.
4. The fourth tweet is about a bond market, mentioning $ bnd shares in NFLX.
5. Fifth tweet continues on selling stocks like MSFT and others.
6. Sixth tweet mentions ""gpro"" but no stock symbol.
7. Seventh tweet suggests buying stocks like AMZN orgoogl without specifics.
8. Eighth tweet talks about oil services, investor opinions, and shares of EGO and AMZN.
9. Ninth tweet discusses a sale between users based on some metrics.
10. Tenth tweet mentions short sales against Norfolk Southern (NSC) and others.
11. Eleventh tweet includes AT_USER with stock symbols related to FB or AMZN.
12. Twelfth tweet is about tracking the performance of AMZN.
13. Thirteenth tweet talks about a chart, mentioning Bezeno, executing actions with CEOs.
14. Fourteenth tweet mentions buying stocks like MSFT and googl.

Now, considering all these tweets, I see that several mention selling stocks (like ""sell in sigma-x"", ""buy in sigma-x""), others talk about trends (AMZN making moves), short sales, bond markets, bond prices, oil services, investor opinions. The overall sentiment seems to be a mix of positive actions like buying stocks and negative reactions from stock holders worried about things.

I don't see any clear indication of strong bullish or bearish signals here. Some tweets are selling, others are selling bonds or shorting. There's also commentary on the economy (oil services) but it's not very specific. The price trends might show some movement, but without a major trend or significant news, it's hard to determine a clear overall sentiment.

Looking at the options: Positive would be if tweets were all about buying or making strong moves. Negative if they were mostly selling or negative news. Neutral if there was mixed reviews. Here, since we have both buy and sell actions, as well as comments from stock holders worried about market movements, I'm leaning towards a mix, but looking at the options given—[Positive], [Neutral], [Negative]—I might consider it neutral because there's no consistent positive or negative trend across all tweets.

Wait, actually, the user provided an example response which concluded with [Neutral]. But in my analysis, I'm seeing both positive and negative elements. Maybe I should check if any of these tweets are explicitly positive about the stock. The only clear positive is selling stocks, but overall, without a dominant trend, it's neutral.

So, putting it all together, I think the impact is neutral."
2015-10-29,Negative,"Okay, let's figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a given company. The user provided a list of 31 tweets that seem to be related to different aspects of AmZN (formerly known as Ztsck) stocks or related companies. 

First, I need to separate the target stock symbol from each tweet. But looking through the tweets, it seems all the mentions are about AmZN and other tech companies like FB, GSPC, QQQ, etc. So maybe each tweet is about a different stock, but they're all under the same project name or something.

Next, for each tweet, I need to identify positive (Positive) and negative (Negative) factors. Positive factors might include things like technical analysis tools showing bullish signals, company earnings reports, or recent news that could boost investor confidence. Negative factors could be warnings about the company's performance, financial losses, competitive issues, etc.

Then, assess each tweet's sentiment by looking at how it affects investor opinion. If the tweet provides good info for AmZN, it might increase the stock price positively. If it mentions negative things like earnings that are expected to fall, it could decrease the price.

For example, in tweet 1, RT $ qqq hft algos triggered a sell in some platforms. This suggests that people selling their shares because they saw positive signals from the tech sector (like the algorithmic trading strategies) or maybe expecting good future performance. That would likely be positive for AmZN since it's showing strong support.

Looking at tweet 2, ""all out $ amzn +1.92"" indicates a gain in price. So this is definitely Positive.

tweet3 seems to be about news that might affect AmZN, but the exact sentiment isn't clear because it mentions things like mall improvements and mobile payments. Without specific info on earnings or trends, it's hard to say if it's positive or negative. It could be neutral if there's no significant direction without concrete data.

tweet4 lists a bunch of companies with futures trading amzn as an option. This is speculative but might imply that people are considering buying more shares, which would increase the price. So Positive.

tweet5 continues talking about amzn and some stock reviews. There's mention of a full chart review for swing post earnings, which sounds positive because if they think the earnings will be good, investors might buy up the stock, pushing it higher. So likely Positive.

tweet6 mentions Fed's刺激经济 again. Positive news from the Fed could boost consumer spending, tech companies, etc., so this would increase amzn's price. Positive sentiment.

tweet7 is a repeat of tweet6, just more of the same info, so probably not adding much. Still positive.

tweet8 says $ googl same as $ amzn watching for new hod. It doesn't give direct info about AmZN but mentions googl. This could indicate that some investors are looking at googl and thinking about their positions in amzn, which might be positive if they're speculating or expecting a good outcome.

tweet9 is about selling shares because of positive tech signals from hft algorithms. Positive factors, so likely Positive.

tweet10 talks about nflx breaking and mentioning msft, gpro, etc., but not directly about amzn. Still positive because it's providing info that could lead to growth, especially if the team shows promise.

tweet11 is a link to another post with similar tech info, suggesting similar sentiment as tweet9. So Positive.

tweet12 talks about an article or news item with financial information. If this provides positive details without conflicting news, like good earnings projections, it would be Positive.

tweet13 is about the tech-focused fund, which might indicate that investors are following specific strategies and thus seeing a buy interest, but not sure if it's positive yet. It could be positive if they're interested in those funds.

tweet14 lists other companies with futures trading amzn as an option. Similar to tweet5, this would push amzn up by increasing demand for shares. Positive sentiment.

tweet15 mentions ""iron condors"" which is a buzzword, possibly related to earnings or stock performance. Still positive because it's good news, though the specific term might be confusing without context.

tweet16 talks about selling shares based on technical signals from hft algs. Positive factors, so likely Positive.

tweet17 mentions another tech-focused article with financial info. It could indicate interest in AmZN and thus push up the stock. Positive sentiment.

tweet18 is a link to another post with tech info, suggesting positive trends. So Positive.

tweet19 has negative news about an event in NY that could affect amzn. The exact details are unclear, but just bad news from elsewhere might reduce the price. Negative impact on AmZN.

tweet20 talks about selling shares due to positive signals. Positive factors, so likely Positive.

tweet21 mentions Google's financials, which is good for tech stocks. Positive sentiment.

tweet22 lists other tech companies with futures trading amzn as an option. This would push up the price by increasing demand. Positive impact on AmZN.

tweet23 talks about the stock market being bullish, leading to more investors wanting to buy AmZN. Positive sentiment.

tweet24 is another link to a tech post, similar to tweet17 and 25, suggesting positive trends.

tweet25 has negative news about an event in NY that could affect amzn. The exact details are unclear but implies bad news, so Negative impact on AmZN.

tweet26 talks about selling shares because of a credit for a stock purchase. Positive factors again, pushing up the price.

tweet27 lists other tech companies with futures trading amzn as an option. This is speculative and positive if expecting good returns.

tweet28 mentions selling to open Amzn's stocks based on some condition. Positive factors, so likely Positive.

tweet29 talks about selling shares because of a credit for a stock sale. Positive factors again.

tweet30 provides more tech info, indicating positive trends without conflicting news.

tweet31 is about introducing a home run fund and listing other tech companies with futures trading amzn as an option. This is speculative but suggests interest in AmZN, so Positive.

Overall, most tweets are either providing positive technical analysis or speculative information about future growth. Only tweet6 has mixed signals with both positive ( Fed刺激经济) and negative ( sell shares for positive trends). But overall, the sentiment seems to be a mix of positive factors leading up to selling and some speculative buys, making it hard to determine a clear overall sentiment without more context on specific news."
2015-10-30,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of Amazon. Hmm, first I need to extract the stock symbol from the tweets. Looking through each tweet, it seems like the main companies mentioned are AMZN (Amazon) and others like VZ,googl, twtr, etc. So the target stock is likely AMZN.

Now, for each tweet, I'll separate them into Positive and Negative factors. Then assess their sentiment and combine the overall impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each one step by step.

Starting with tweet 1: It talks about Ackman's idea for delivering prescriptions at an $vrx conference call. That sounds like a positive factor since it's about innovation and maybe future growth potential. So Positive.

Tweet 2 is a URL with multiple companies, but the main point seems to be that Amazon is being endorsed by Satish Kumar. Since he's associated with tech companies, this could indicate support or endorsement from investors who care about AMZN. That might boost the stock positively. So Positive.

Tweet 3 mentions sco proshares and crude oil info. It doesn't directly relate to AMZN but gives more information about sco. This seems like neutral content that could just be extra information without a clear sentiment about Amazon's performance. So Neutral.

Tweet 4 discusses bidweeklyta, multiple tech stocks including Amzn. Similar to tweet 2, Satish Kumar's endorsement is expected to support the stock. Positive factor for Amazon.

 Tweet 5 thanks $amzn endorsement and mentions VRX. Again, similar to tweets 1 and 4, mentioning another tech company that might be supportive of AMZN. Positive sentiment towards Amazon.

Tweet 6 talks about Ackman's idea for mail-order pharmacies in Jeff Bezos' capacity. This is relevant since Jeff Bezos was a big supporter of Amazon (Amazon Inc., Inc.), so this could indicate support or positive feedback from investors who follow Jeff. Positive factor, which would boost Amazon's stock.

Tweet 7 discusses Satish Kumar again and mentions $aapl, googl, fb, amzn. This is similar to tweet 2 with the same kind of endorsement about Amazon being a key player in tech. Positive sentiment towards Amazon.

Tweet 8 lists gains and losses for the week but doesn't mention AMZN specifically. However, it's likely that this could indicate overall investor sentiment towards Amazon. If there are positive news around AMZN, that would be positive. So probably positive overall.

Tweet 9 mentions a company forum on accenture, which is a tech company, not directly related to Amazon. It might be additional info but doesn't affect Amazon's stock price much. Neutral content generally isn't very influential unless it's about the company itself.

Tweet 10 talks about AMZN's workers shipping products like sneakers and consoles. This is about the business operations and revenue streams. While it's positive, I don't have enough specific information to determine a clear sentiment impact on Amazon's stock price directly.

Tweet 11 mentions maturity date for $lnkd, which is part of Alphabet Inc., not Amazon. Again, unrelated to AMZN. It might be extra info but no direct influence. Neutral content here doesn't affect the stock significantly unless it's about Alphabet.

Tweet 12 discusses Amazon being on a forum and mentions the highest puts and calls. This sounds like a trading strategy or event related to options trading. The sentiment isn't directly tied to AMZN performance, so this could be neutral or maybe slightly positive if AMZN is involved in such discussions. But since it's about trades rather than actual news about Amazon's stock, it's less likely.

Tweet 13 mentions the price movement for XHB and the highest puts/calls. Again, more about trading strategies than direct investor sentiment on Amazon's stock. So maybe a bit of neutral effect here as well.

Tweet 14 talks about China dropping rates and Amazon releasing a profit, which could indicate positive news about Amazon's financials or market performance. This is relevant because Amazon has strong revenue streams from China. So this would be a positive factor for Amazon.

Now, let me summarize each tweet's impact:

1. Positive
2. Positive
3. Neutral
4. Positive
5. Positive
6. Positive
7. Positive
8. Possibly Positive (if there's any indication of AMZN being boosted)
9. Neutral
10. Doesn't directly affect Amazon, so maybe slight influence but not enough to tip the balance.
11. Neutral
12. Maybe a bit of influence if Amazon is involved in trading strategies, but less likely.
13. Neutral
14. Positive

Putting it all together, most tweets are positive or neutral except for tweet 8 and 10 which might lean towards positive but not sure. Since tweet 14 mentions China rates dropping, which could boost Amazon's revenue from China, that adds to the overall positive sentiment.

Therefore, the overall sentiment is leaning positive because there are a lot of supportive tweets about Amazon, especially around innovation, support from big tech companies like Jeff Bezos, and possibly financial news related to Amazon's performance."
2015-10-31,Neutral,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price for a given company. Let's break it down step by step.

First, each tweet is about different companies and factors related to them. The target stock isn't specified in the provided tweets, but maybe it can be inferred from context or other sources not included here.

Looking at tweet 1: ""scan of various daily charts $ ndx $ qqq $ nyse $ aapl $ intc $ goog $ amzn URL"" – this seems like a collection or list of different stock symbols. It doesn't provide specific info about the target stock, so maybe I can assume it's related to the given company from the output.

Now, tweet 2: ""rt AT_USER what happens if $ nymo breaks the 'pivot ? ' $ spy $ aapl $ iwm $ qqq $ nflx $ tsla $ amzn $ nke URL"" – this one is more about investing and stock performance. It mentions things like pivot points in stock charts, which are common indicators used by investors to predict price movements. The user seems to be encouraging readers to keep an eye on these factors.

Tweet 3: ""hain hain celestial group , inc . tick URL $ hain $ rsx $ auy $ amzn hain stocks financehal halliburton co . yield …"" – this tweet is confusing with some slang and mentions celestial group, which might be a typo or referring to a company. The presence of 'tick' makes me think it's a stock ticker.

Tweet 4: ""nke nike inc . tick URL $ nke $ amzn $ ief $ v nke stockmarket stocks"" – again, the first tweet starts with 'scan of various daily charts', which suggests this is related to NKE. The user mentions NKE and others like AMZN and IEF.

Tweet 5: ""tech's fab 5 are now worth $ 2.2 trillion - $ aapl $ googl $ msft $ amzn $ fb URL"" – here, the first part talks about tech companies and their total value at $2.2 trillion. It seems like this is an announcement about the combined value of several tech firms.

Putting it all together, these tweets are providing information about specific stock prices (like NKE) or discussing market factors such as pivot points, pivot teams, and the combined size of tech companies. Since they're not all positive or negative but give various insights into the current financials or investor sentiment, I'm leaning towards a neutral stance.

Wait, tweet 2 specifically mentions something about stock performance based on pivot points, which are common indicators, so it might indicate that there's some investment focus or analysis. But overall, since they're providing factual data without strong positive or negative keywords, the impact is considered neutral."
2015-11-01,Negative,"Alright, I need to determine the impact of the given tweets on the future stock price of a company. Let me start by breaking down each tweet and analyzing them step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol. The tweets mention terms like ""APL,"" ""FB,"" ""AMZN,"" ""NFLX,"" etc., so I can infer that one of these stocks is the focus here. But without knowing which specific stock it refers to, I'll assume each tweet might be about a different company.

Now, for each tweet, I'll separate them into positive and negative factors. Let's look at the first tweet: ""rt smtraderca : ' weekly market recap & stock updates - 11/1 / 2015 ' $ aapl $ fb $ amzn $ nflx $ googl $ twtr $ tsla $ ibb $ gs … URL"" This seems like a weekly market summary with several stock names listed. It mentions stock updates and the company ""smtraderca,"" which isn't familiar, so maybe it's not a known company. The other tweets: AT_USER responds with ""Thank you."" ""we nailed $ fb $ spy $ nflx $ amzn $ jom etc for 100 % to 200 % wins . boom!"" This seems like a positive response from a user thanking them for achieving a certain outcome, which is a strong positive indicator of confidence.

But wait, without knowing the exact stock mentioned in each tweet, it's hard to assess the sentiment directly. However, if AT_USER responds with ""boom,"" that's a bit vague and could be interpreted as optimistic or even positive. On the other hand, the first tweet lists multiple stocks but doesn't specify which one is being referred to, so it might not provide enough context.

Looking at the output requirement, I need to conclude with ""[Positive]"", ""[Neutral]"", or ""[Negative]"". Given that AT_USER's response is very positive and seems like a friendly thank you for achieving good results, this could suggest a positive sentiment towards the stock. Even though the first tweet mentions multiple stocks without identifying which one, it might not be actionable enough to influence the stock price directly.

So, considering the available information, the overall sentiment based on the positive response is likely ""[Positive]""."
2015-11-02,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. First, I'll need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet since it's the key piece of information.

Looking at the tweets provided:

1. ""rt AT_USER gdxj market vectors junior gold miners company info URL $ gdxj $ amzn $ himx $ vscp gdxj stockmarket inve …"" – Hmm, this seems a bit off. The symbol is mentioned as $ gdxj, which doesn't seem right for Amazon or any known company. Maybe it's a typo or an irrelevant tweet.

2. ""breaking : $ gs $ jpm $ bp china $ spy $ msft cnbc $ es $ spx $ appl $ ba $ amzn japan reuters germany uk france news URL"" – Here, the main stock is amzn with ""amzn japan reuters germany uk france news URL"". That's a lot of info but again, not specific to Amazon.

3. ""halloween / november positioning . momentum monday movers $ wyn , $ ccl . light this candle $ amzn evening star URL"" – This seems more positive, mentioning something about the market trend and stock name.

4. ""$ wmt $ amzn : why walmart ’ s same-day pickup strategy faces long odds : URL"" – Comparing Amazon's price versus Walmart's pickup rate. This could affect Amazon's valuation but might not be a strong indicator of overall sentiment.

5. ""rt AT_USER trader cheat sheets : URL $ fb $ aapl $ twtr $ amzn $ nflx $ googl $ ibb $ gild $ tsla $ baba $ gs"" – More trader advice, maybe about stock performance or earnings? Not sure how significant this is to Amazon's price.

6. ""URL <-- exciting new AT_USER guru ! this guy is goina be huge ! $ vltc $ vggl $ amzn $ msft"" – The user mentions a new guide from someone who seems to think the stock will perform well, suggesting high expectations.

7. ""gear up for chinese single's day URL via AT_USER $ amzn $ jd $ tcehy $ baba"" – Promising something significant with Chinese Singles' Day, which could be a boost in sales or earnings. Positive outlook.

8. ""now its worth more than retail ! hype AT_USER how amazon took control of the cloud | john naughton $ amzn URL"" – Amazon is taking over a major component of their business, which might improve their revenue and stock value. High confidence in this.

9. ""$ intc $ t $ sso $ amzn intc tradeideas share"" – Exchange rate info with an investment theme, but no immediate effect on Amazon's stock price.

10. ""icymi-get ready for this weeks action ! $ googl $ fb $ baba $ am zngr $ trip $ vrsn $ nflx $ zoes URL"" – More trading advice and stock names, not directly related to Amazon performance.

Now, compiling the factors from each tweet:

- Positive tweets: 3 (about momentum, positioning, outlook), 8 (cloud control), 10 (trading tips).
- Negative tweets: None.

Sentiment analysis shows multiple positive tweets that could indicate strong support for Amazon. The lack of negative tweets makes it hard to see a clear overall trend. However, the presence of trading advice and cloud control strategies is a common signal of good company performance. Plus, the fact that amzn is taking over a major component might suggest future growth.

Considering all this, it's leaning towards a positive sentiment. Even though not every tweet is explicitly positive about Amazon's stock price, the majority of positive factors seem to point towards a favorable outlook."
2015-11-03,Neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets about Amazon's stock performance based on their impact. First, I need to go through each tweet and extract the target stock symbol from the mentions like $ amzn, $ gequ, etc.

Looking at the tweets, they mention Amazon a lot. Let me list them:

1. $ amzn
2. $ amzn
3. $ amzn
4. $ amzn
5. $ amzn
6. $ amzn
7. $ amzn
8. $ amzn
9. $ amzn
10. $ amzn
11. $ amzn
12. $ amzn
13. $ amzn
14. $ amzn
15. $ amzn
16. $ amzn
17. $ amzn

So, the target stock is Amazon and it appears in every tweet except one that mentions GeQU. 

Now, I need to analyze each tweet's factors. The first task is to identify Positive and Negative factors for each.

Looking at the tweets:

- Tweets 2 and 4 mention negative things about AMZN, like online retail losing momentum.
- Tweets 3, 7, 10, 15, etc., talk about good news, like new perks or physical stores opening.
- The rest are neutral but mostly positive.

Next, I'll assess the sentiment by evaluating each tweet. Positive tweets usually increase stock price, while negative ones decrease it.

Tweets 2 and 4: Both have negative statements, so they're likely Negative.

Tweets 3,7,10, etc.: Positive statements about growth, new initiatives, which generally boost stock performance. So these are also Positive.

All other tweets seem neutral or just informative but not strongly influencing sentiment. They don't add much to the overall picture.

Now, combining all this: mostly the company is doing well (Positive tweets), but a couple of days are really bad (Negative). However, most of the information is about positive developments.

I think the overall sentiment is leaning towards Positive because there's a mix of good news and occasional negative comments. The majority of the information is in support, so it shouldn't be too negative."
2015-11-04,Neutral,"Alright, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet talks about the best growth story of the decade, mentioning $AMZN revenue hits in CRM and CRW. This is positive because it shows good performance over time.
2. The second tweet is about drones powered by fuel cells, which is a tech topic. While it's positive for tech companies generally, I don't see any direct ties to Amazon or its stock.
3. Third tweet lists several stocks and a trade symbol, but nothing directly related to Amazon or their performance.
4. Fourth tweet mentions the smart money selling TBills to buy AMZN, which is negative because selling high-yield bonds can reduce investor confidence in buying more shares.
5. Fifth tweet talks about massive gains on penny stocks, but without any mention of AMZN or its stock price.
6. Sixth tweet discusses revenue growth across multiple companies including AMZN and others. Positive because it's showing good company performance, which could boost Amazon's stock.
7. Seventh tweet offers financial alerts aiming for a better life. This is positive as it's a proactive approach to improving the user's financial situation.
8. Eighth tweet lists various tech companies, none of which are AMZN. So, no direct impact on Amazon.
9. Ninth tweet mentions Stan Druckenmiller talking about AMZN and IBM, but again, not directly related.
10. Tenth tweet compares AMZN crushing traditional retailers and media. This is negative because it could lead to lower demand for AMZN shares as customers prefer other brands.
11. Eleventh tweet talks about buybacks by AMZN's CEO, which can affect investor sentiment negatively if buyers feel undervalued after buying back shares.
12. Twelfth tweet says AMZN will kill the NASDAQ this year, which is a sell-off scenario that could lower stock prices and lead to negative sentiment.
13. Thirteenth tweet compares XLO and XLP spread, impacting financial markets but not specifically AMZN or its performance.
14. Fourteenth tweet mentions $GS and other companies. No direct link to AMZN's performance.
15. Fifteenth tweet discusses tech company performance with positive points for AMZN and other big names. This is a strong indicator of good market trends, which can boost Amazon's stock price.
16. Fifteenth tweet doesn't state any opinion; it just gives numbers.
17. Sixteenth tweet offers another financial bonus plan for portfolio management. Positive as it could attract investors.
18. Seventeenth tweet about portfolio management and how Tuckerivalence takes the lead in the S&P 500, positive trend that might favor AMZN.
19. Eighteenth tweet about Facebook's earnings beating estimates, which is positive news, but not directly related to Amazon.
20. Nineteenth tweet mentions high volume activity on NASDAQ and S&P 500 indices, indicating a bullish market environment.

Now, considering all these factors, I have several positive tweets (1-7) that show strong company performance or trends, which could positively impact AMZN's stock. However, there are negative tweets (4-19) like selling TBills, price comparisons with competitors, and the NASDAQ sell-off, which might reduce sentiment. The overall sentiment isn't clear-cut because some positive factors may not outweigh the negatives."
2015-11-05,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. The user provided eight tweets and some sample output from my analysis.

First, looking at each tweet individually might be tricky because they're all separate, but maybe there's a pattern or common theme. Let me go through them one by one.

1. ""the market has fangs and they are unstopabble , says AT_USER URL wallstreet $ fb $ amzn $ nflx $ googl""
Hmm, this seems like a promotional link to companies: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google. It's not a tweet about a stock but more about the market itself.

2. ""rt AT_USER here are the 15 largest companies in the $ spy . $ fb is going to try to jump $ ge and $ amzn tomorrow . URL""
This one seems like an analyst predicting movements for Facebook, Google, and Amazon. It might be a bit vague, but it's about forecasting stock movements.

3. ""aws cloud business worth $ 160 billion : analysts URL cloud aws $ amzn""
This looks more like a quote with numbers about AWS' revenue or assets related to Amazon. No mention of a company yet.

4. ""gain from movement in these buzzing assets $ fb $ aapl $ amzn $ usdjpy $ djia""
Again, this is talking about assets moving and expecting gains. Maybe an analyst's opinion on investments in Facebook, Apple, USDCNY.

5. ""amzn should i enter long today waiting the end of november ?""
This is a direct question asking if I should buy Amazon stock for the upcoming November expiration. That's pretty straightforward—direct information about actions to take based on future conditions.

6. ""rt AT_USER top s & p 500 stocks by market cap : $ aapl ( $ 682b ) $ googl ( $ 527b ) $ goog ( $ 508b ) $ msft ( $ 434b ) $ xom ( $ 358b ) $ fb ( $ 308b ) $ amzn ( 306 …""
This one is similar to tweet 8, listing the top stocks by market cap. It's more about ranking and not directly about a stock.

7. ""aapl $ am zn $ googl : apple tv users are mostly gen x men : URL""
This seems to link Amazon with Gen X users. It might be suggesting a shift in consumer behavior affecting the company, but it's vague without context.

8. ""rt AT_USER since 2009 , amazon is now up over 1,000 % . here's the chart . from AT_USER URL""
This looks like an analyst's forecast about Amazon's growth since 2009, based on a provided chart. It's projecting a significant increase in revenue.

Now, considering all these tweets, they seem to be providing financial projections or market analyses related to Amazon and Facebook. Each tweet is either predicting stock movements, forecasting performance, or discussing broader trends like revenue growth.

Since there are no positive or negative indicators directly about the company being purchased or sold, or any actual news on a specific stock, it's hard to determine a clear impact. The tweets are more about analysis than factual information that would affect the stock price.

Therefore, I think the overall sentiment is neutral because there isn't sufficient information to assess a positive or negative effect on the stock price."
2015-11-06,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how these tweets affect the stock price of AmZN. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll look for the stock symbol mentioned in each tweet. The most obvious one is AMZN, which stands for Amazon. That's clear from a lot of the tweets mentioning it. Now, I need to analyze how each tweet influences investor sentiment towards Amzn.

Looking at tweet 1: It says Facebook and Amazon are splitting their market share between them and Jeff Bezos' Amazon. But Facebook's share is higher. This seems neutral because it's about market shares rather than positive or negative news about the company itself.

Next, tweet 2 mentions Giants tightening grip on the internet economy. That sounds positive because it's a general outlook, so that's a good sign for Amzn. It doesn't directly mention Amzn, but it supports their position in the industry.

Tweet 3 talks about market recap and trade ideas from SPY, IWM, AAPL, NFLX, AMZN, GOOG, FB, TWTR. All these are tech stocks, so it's supportive of the broader tech sector, which is part of Amzn's operations. This might indicate a good trend in general.

Tweet 4 says that AT_USER raised their picks by dips not rips, meaning they're cautious. While some investors might be avoiding Amzn due to concerns about its stock price fluctuations, it doesn't necessarily mean the stock is bad or positive. It could just be more defensive.

Tweet 5 mentions US unemployment has dropped to 5%, which is good for the economy and could boost Amzn's sales. This seems like a strong indicator of positive trends, so that should positively affect the stock price.

Tweet 6 refers back to giants tightening grip on the internet economy, reinforcing the sentiment from tweet 2 about the broader industry outlook.

Tweet 7 discusses Morningstar assigning a BBB rating, which is neutral because it doesn't provide positive or negative information. It's more of a market analysis that might not directly impact Amzn negatively or positively.

Tweet 8 talks about some big names potentially improving their rankings on theppy chart, which again doesn't indicate anything specific about Amzn. So, this is just general information.

Tweets 9 and 10 are about Amazon and GM (General Motors). It's a bit unclear what these tweets mean by ""special collection,"" but it seems like they're discussing Amazon and General Motors separately. Since the main focus on Amzn here is tweet 5, which has good economic data, this might be a supportive factor.

Tweet 10 mentions US unemployment dropping to 5%, similar to tweet 6, so that's another positive indicator for Amzn.

Looking at tweet 3 again, it's about tech stocks, which are part of Amazon. So even if some tweets mention specific companies like AWS or others in the tech space, they're generally supportive as long as they don't contradict Amzn's fundamentals.

Overall, most tweets point towards a positive outlook for Amzn, especially with good economic data and industry trends. The neutral tweet (tweet 7) is the only one that doesn't strongly support Amzn, but all others are positive in some way."
2015-11-07,Positive,"Okay, I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on the stock price for the given company. The user provided three tweets, but they're all in a similar format with lots of stock symbols like FB, AMZN, NKE, etc.

First, looking at each tweet individually. They mention things like ""turnarounds stocks that can double your money in 2016,"" which sounds optimistic. Then the next two tweets list several tech companies, again focusing on growth and potential for rising prices.

I think about what these trends indicate. A lot of positive language about turning around stocks could imply confidence in future performance. The use of ""leaps higher"" suggests a belief that the stock price will increase significantly. Also, mentioning various tech companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft might suggest broad optimism among investors.

Considering all this, each tweet is promoting growth prospects for tech companies. Investors often react positively to such statements because they believe the sector has potential. There's no explicit negative mention, so it's hard to tell if it's a downvote or just positive language without more context.

Therefore, putting it all together, these tweets seem to be positive indicators of strong future growth and market confidence."
2015-11-08,Negative,"Alright, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the company. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. **First Tweet**: It mentions that Amazon is up a lot from 2009 and has a significant increase. This suggests strong growth, which could be positive.
   
2. **Second Tweet**: Talks about nasdaq reaching new highs, specifically on FB,googl, etc. While this shows the company's market presence but doesn't mention sentiment yet.

3. **Third Tweet**: Focuses on Twitter stock buzz, mentioning various companies. This might indicate increased interest or activity, which can affect investor sentiment.

4. **Fourth Tweet**: Similar to the third one, focusing on stock buzz for multiple companies. Consistent information without immediate sentiment cues.

5. **Fifth Tweet**: Says Amazon is up 1819%, comparing it to other tech stocks like Aapl and Xlv. Positive growth number might imply good performance.

6. **Sixth Tweet**: Talks about reformedjoker, which I'm not sure about. It mentions nasdaq reaching new highs again but doesn't mention sentiment.

7. **Seventh and Eighth Tweets**: Both discuss Nasdaq jumping higher on FB, Aapl, Nke, Goog, etc. Again, this could indicate rising interest or market confidence.

8. **Ninth Tweet**: Outlines Facebook's exit into the $300 billion club with Ge and others, mentioning tech companies. This seems positive for Facebook but maybe not directly about Amazon.

9. **Tenth Tweet**: No specific content mentioned. Maybe a typo or incomplete tweet.

10. **Eleventh Tweet**: Discusses Nasdaq reaching new highs on FB and Aapl. Similar to the seventh tweet, indicating broader market activity.

11. **Twelfth Tweet**: Talks about Facebook's stock review discussing several stocks. It might be providing more context but doesn't lean towards positive sentiment immediately.

12. **Thirteenth Tweet**: Discusses multiple tech companies, including FB and others. This could mean increased competition or interest in tech stocks.

13. **Fourteenth Tweet**: Focuses on Facebook's entry into the $300 billion club with Ge and other tech companies. This shows expansion but might not directly impact Amazon unless it affects the overall market.

14. **Fifteenth Tweet**: Ends abruptly, possibly incomplete or a typo.

15. **Sixteenth Tweet**: Suggests the wall street expectation of distributing regulators after employment. It's unclear how this relates to the stock price of the company mentioned.

16. **Seventeenth Tweet**: Reformsjoker discussing multiple companies, which could indicate broader market sentiment or interest in tech stocks.

From these tweets, most are about Nasdaq hitting new highs and positive growth numbers for Facebook and its competitors. However, some mention strong growth from 2009 to current but without specific context on Amazon's performance yet. The overall sentiment seems mixed because while there is significant market activity and growth numbers, the explicit statement about Amazon rising (1819%) in one tweet might indicate a positive impact for Amazon, though it doesn't directly discuss that stock. Without direct information on Amazon's stock price movement, I'm leaning towards a moderate positive overall sentiment."
2015-11-09,Neutral,"Okay, I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price for Aapl. Let me start by going through each tweet one by one.

The first tweet says 60% of top tech companies in America were founded by immigrants from the first or second generation. That seems like a positive sign because it shows global influence and diversity, which could boost investor confidence. So, that's a positive factor.

Next, the tweet talks about how Amazon and two others are changing operations forever, focusing on tech innovation. This is definitely good news for Aapl as they're expanding into new areas. That's another positive point.

The third tweet mentions someone named Satish Kumar buying shares through a social media account, holding through the end of the year. That suggests optimism about the company and expects steady growth. So that's positive too.

The fourth tweet says $663 could trigger a quick run to $672, suggesting Aapl is on an upward trend with some resistance. The stock might jump quickly if things go well. That's another positive outlook.

The fifth tweet asks about spouse seeing Amazon Prime gift orders and mentions closing those gift orders. This seems like something that would impact the company’s revenue as customers move away from Amazon Prime, possibly reducing sales. So this could be a negative factor because it's expected to reduce profits.

The sixth tweet is about Wmt with an increased P/E ratio. A higher P/E could mean investors are more willing to pay a premium for future earnings, which might boost the stock price. That’s positive.

The seventh tweet suggests that Amzn and Google are up 6 consecutive weeks, showing strong recent performance. This is definitely good news and confirms their momentum, adding to the upward trend.

The eighth tweet mentions liquid leaders from Amzn and Google showing progress in a 6-week period. Liquid leaders indicate the companies have enough cash flow or other resources to operate well, which supports their success. Another positive factor.

The ninth tweet talks about BBby guys being circuit city already selling items for Amzn. This could be a shock event if they're going public soon, but it might also signal strong growth potential as the company goes ahead with sales. So this is another positive factor that's expected to drive growth.

Putting all these together, there are both positive and negative factors. The initial positive signs about global diversity, tech innovation, and solid performance seem to dominate, while the shock event in the last tweet could be a turning point. However, considering the other tweets, especially the ones predicting Amazon's rise, which is a major market player, it leans slightly positive but with some uncertainty due to the shock event.

I think overall sentiment might still lean towards positive because the strong signals from the tweets are supportive of growth and diversification, even though there's a risk element from the unexpected news about Amzn going public."
2015-11-10,Positive,"Okay, I need to figure out how to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by breaking down each tweet.

First, I'll extract the stock symbol from the tweets. The most common one seems to be AMZN or ""amzn"". So that's my target stock.

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. I'm looking at both the content of the tweet and any specific terms like URL or mentions of companies.

Looking at the first tweet: ""$ twtr about to go green get mentor live URL $ fb $ amzn $ away."" It mentions AMZN going green and has some other financial keywords like "" Mentor live"" and ""URL"". I'm not sure what those abbreviations stand for, but ""mentor live"" might mean something related to investors or a specific term.

The second tweet: ""$ rt AT_USER customers are complaining about malware on $ amzn URL."" Here, ""AT_USER"" is probably referring to Amazon's customer service. The mention of malware suggests negative sentiment because it indicates security issues.

Third tweet: ""alot of chatrooms are afraid to play the big board stocks , like $ amzn $ goog $ googl $ pcln but in awesomecalls its …"" It mentions multiple companies, some of which could be Amazon or Alphabet (GOOG). The wording about fear and not wanting to play the big board might imply uncertainty.

Fourth tweet: ""$ amzn URL inc . market cap."" This is a direct mention of AMZN's financial status with ""inc."" which I think stands for incorporated. It doesn't have any negative keywords, so perhaps neutral or positive based on other factors.

Fifth tweet: ""rt reformedjoker : * * * hint URL bullish $ fb $ amzn $ googl 🙄 ™ speaking o $ fb later twit $ twtr … …"" The words ""reformedjoker"" and the symbol hints about a bullish trend, which is positive. The mention of Facebook and Google could be related to tech stocks, but I'm not sure if that's positive or negative.

Sixth tweet: ""cree cree , inc . open URL $ Cree $ nflx $ amzn $ gg cree nasdaq stock."" The term ""climbing"" might indicate rising confidence in the company's position.

Seventh tweet: ""$ gg goldcorp , inc . exchange $ gg $ amzn $ upro $ hyg $ gg investing nasdaqgild gilead sciences , inc . prev close …"" It mentions gold and investing, which could be positive because gold is a safe asset. But ""uptro"" might not make much sense.

Eighth tweet: ""if u want to buy world's best ecommerce company y risk it w / $ baba where transparency is real issue - - stick w / $ amzn innovation domination."" It suggests caution with BABA stock, which could imply negative sentiment due to concerns about transparency and competition.

Ninth tweet: ""$ our stock alerts gained over 1,900 % in 2 and a half months ! see our special new pick : URL $ amzn $ mcox $ goog."" This is a strong statement that might indicate positive news, such as significant gains, so likely a positive impact.

Tenth tweet: ""$ csal communications sales & leasing , inc . 52wk high URL $ csal $ amzn $ xle $ latx csal stockmarket tradeideas."" CSAL has ""sales"" and ""leasing,"" which could be positive for the company, but I'm not sure if it's about Amazon.

Now, combining these factors: The company mentions AMZN, which is a major player. It also talks about security issues like malware in some tweets. While there are gains mentioned (first tweet even mentions AMZN going green), the negative comments and some positive ones balance each other out. However, the significant 1900% gain suggests strong positive impact.

So overall sentiment is positive because despite some negative points, the major gains and clear positive statements outweigh them."
2015-11-11,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets about Facebook's stock and determine if they're positive, neutral, or negative for the future price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

Starting with the first tweet: It mentions Facebook's earnings expected to grow 20% annually across five stocks like Amazon, JBLU, Amba, FitURL. That sounds positive because it gives a clear, forward-looking outlook which usually boosts investor confidence and can drive price movements. So that’s likely positive.

The second tweet talks about Alibaba investing in U.S. startups for expansion plans. This is a positive sign because it's showing growth potential, so the stock might rise. Also, the URL links don’t seem to be negative, just mentions something else, which is neutral but positive in context.

Third tweet is an RT mentioning Amazon’s cloud success staking fears of old tech failures. That sounds like it could make investors nervous, which might be a sign of concern about competition and potential price decline. But the overall market might see some volatility, so it's uncertain if this is positive or negative on the stock alone.

Fourth tweet from Amazon says they're putting out their final thoughts on their movie but feel more optimistic than before. This shows strong performance and could lead to positive sentiment, maybe even a dip in price as people wait for results.

Fifth tweet sets a new 52-week high for $Amzn. That's a clear upward movement which often signals potential buying pressure, so this is positive news for the stock.

Sixth tweet again mentions Amazon’s cloud success and stoking fears of old tech failures. It's similar to tweet three but from a different user. Again, it's about competition concerns, which could be negative sentiment on a local level, but overall market might take some time to react.

Seven tweet is RT from a user about blackberry doing well, implying positive for Amazon. This could boost Amazon's position and lead to positive news, possibly causing a slight price increase.

Eighth tweet says $Amzn broke out 957x earnings, different from last time. High earnings can signal good momentum and might drive the stock up, so this is positive.

Ninth tweet mentions NASDAQ trends among several companies but doesn't specify which ones. It's too vague to assess definitively, so it’s neutral overall.

Tenth tweet suggests Amazon prices will reach $700. That’s a specific target price, which could be seen as a positive signal if the company is aiming for higher valuations and investor interest in long-term growth.

Eleventh tweet talks about NASDAQ trends among several companies but just mentions specific ones without more context. So it's neutral.

Twelfth tweet says $Amzn broke out to 957x earnings, which was mentioned earlier. This reinforces the positive earnings news, so likely positive sentiment.

Thirteenth tweet is RT from a user about blackberry doing well, similar to tweet seven, implying positive for Amazon. Again, suggests positive sentiment.

Fourteenth tweet mentions assets seeing jumps in tweets, indicating growth potential and could drive price increases.

Fifteenth tweet is an RT from seekingalpha, noting a new relic and gem in the cloud. This sounds speculative but might indicate a strategic move or concern about tech, which could be negative if perceived as risky.

Sixteenth tweet is another RT from seekingalpha. Doesn't specify content, so too vague—neutral.

Seventeenth tweet suggests buying shares of $ cop (Alphabet), mila (iShares MSCI USA Index), ibex (Index of Europe), etc. This indicates a mix of positive growth areas like tech stocks, which can drive the overall market up.

Eighteenth tweet is about millennials pulling into their portfolios with 50% investment in Amazon and NFLX. This could be seen as growth for younger investors, which might boost Amazon's performance and thus the stock positively.

Nineteenth tweet talks about a $71k trade, following signals on specific stocks. This is speculative but potentially indicates positive buy interest or news worth more than just price movement.

Now, to summarize: The stock is mentioned in multiple tweets focusing on growth, earnings, and positive user interactions. Positive tweets include earnings expectations, new stocks doing well, high stock prices, and buy buys. Negative tweets are the ones about competition concerns and tech risks, but overall, there's a trend of positive signals that could push the stock up. However, since not all negative tweets dominate the sentiment, it leans more towards neutral."
2015-11-12,Neutral,"Alright, so I need to analyze these tweets and figure out if they have a positive, neutral, or negative impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by going through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions that AT_USER thinks $BBY is just a ""showroom"" for AmZN and now Amzn has way more retails. I'm not sure if this is positive because it seems like Amzn is expanding their product range, which could be good, but maybe not necessarily bad. It might signal growth.

2. The second tweet talks about Amzn's price going up by 42 points and having an average daily volatility of 34. This is a numerical analysis, so I should look at the numbers. Since it went up by 42 points and the volatility is quite high, this seems positive because higher prices are generally seen as good signs.

3. The third tweet says that traders sold on Amazon's strength index (AMZN). That could mean Amzn has strong growth, which is a positive sign for the stock price. It might also indicate investor confidence.

4. This one just repeats ""AT_USER AT_USER i shorted $amzn once . once."" No information here about sentiment or impact on stock.

5. The tweet mentions that $NGG and $AMZN reported a 4598 gap, which was expected to be 4504-70. Wait, the numbers look off because 4598 minus 4504 is only 94, not 70. Maybe it's a typo or some confusion in data. If the actual number was higher than expected, that could raise expectations.

6. This tweet talks about a small company with 40 employees vying on Amzn's largest business. While it's a good move for growth, but since it's a small company, maybe it could be overpriced or too risky, which might be negative.

7. Another mention of Amzn, so I'll need to think about other factors here. Maybe the overall market is doing well, which would affect Amzn.

8. This one lists stocks with an RSI of 14 and mentions others like DD and AMZN. An RSI below 30 usually indicates overbought or bearish conditions, so lower RSI might be a sign to watch.

9. The tweet discusses Amzn's performance on several days but doesn't give any price changes or volatility info, just talking about the stock market reports of GOG and AMZN.

10. This one says that by loving tech, you should buy their stock. It seems like a marketing push rather than any positive information about the company's performance.

11. Talks about tracking trending assets and using a watchlist with FTSE 100 stocks including Amzn. No indication of positive or negative sentiment here.

12. Lists SPX stocks but doesn't give price changes, just mentions something else about their performance on certain days.

13. China's e-commerce site drops as part of the holiday sales promotion that outperformed Black Friday. Maybe this could be a sign that consumer confidence is up, which might boost Amzn's stock.

14. Another list with AMZN and others, mentioning RSI 14. Again, lower RSI might suggest overbought, so not sure about sentiment here.

15. Talks about Amzn's price movement of 2.15% and a year-over-year increase of 113%. This is clearly positive news, which would likely boost the stock price positively.

Putting it all together, I notice that most tweets are pointing towards positive aspects like growth, market performance, or brand promotion. The only negative-looking tweet was 6 about the small company vying on Amzn's biggest business. The other tweets either discuss growth (like trading on strength index) or mention price increases with numbers (2, 5, 10). There are a few mentions of China's sales boost and other positive factors. So overall, there's a mix of mixed and mostly positive sentiments."
2015-11-13,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of the company. The user provided 12 tweets and specific stock symbols from them. My task is to determine if each tweet affects the overall sentiment and then decide if it's positive, neutral, or negative.

First, I need to identify the target stock for each tweet. But looking at the tweets, some of them mention multiple stocks but don't specify the company explicitly. For example, ""we'll be reviewing today's playbook on chat audio in 10 mins for members . reviewing : $ nflx $ googl $ amzn $ aapl $ fos…"" Here, it mentions NFLX, GOOGL, AMZN, and APA. I think NFLX is the stock ticker for Facebook (FB), so maybe that's the company we're focusing on.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one to see what they mention regarding the target stock. I need to assess whether each tweet contributes positively or negatively to investor sentiment. Since I don't have real-time data, I'll rely on the language and statements from the users involved.

Looking at the tweets:

1. ""we'll be reviewing today's playbook on chat audio in 10 mins for members . reviewing : $ nflx $ googl $ amzn $ aapl $ fos…"" This seems like it's just informing about upcoming updates, so no direct impact on stock price yet. It might encourage investors, but without specific info on trends or technicals, it's neutral.

2. ""rt AT_USER here are my gains and losses for the week : URL $ nflx $ tsla $ aapl $ googl $ amzn $ vrx URL"" This tweet is encouraging users about gains and losses in their portfolio. It might indicate confidence but doesn't directly mention changes to the stock price.

3. ""gg goldcorp , inc . day low URL $ gg $ spxs $ amzn $ kmi gg nasdaq nasdaq"" Mentioning a stock (Gold) could suggest economic news or market trends affecting the company's stock, which might influence investor sentiment.

4. ""amazon to build data center on a classified us intelligence campus . aws cloud $ amzn URL"" This seems like a strategic announcement about expansion, which can affect stock price positively if it's good for growth.

5. ""satish_kumar 21 : – $ aapl , $ amzn , $ googl team up in fintech coalition URL fintech analytics … URL"" Satish is involved in a project to collaborate on fintech. This could be positive news, encouraging stock performance.

6. ""rt klarkkant : aapl , $ amzn , $ googl team up in fintech coalition URL"" Similar to tweet 5, it's about a collaboration, so likely positive for the company.

7. ""$ amzn started 630/620 jan ps for 3.20"" This might indicate earnings or financial health; could be seen as positive news affecting stock price.

8. ""retail = $ amzn all others are doomed"" This tweet is pretty strong, suggesting the company will likely decline because competitors are struggling. Negative sentiment here would be significant.

9. ""AT_USER hope some took these trades mentioned previously market . nice right .. short $ googl $ $ amzn $ fb $ nflx"" Encouraging trading activities might lead to gains, positive for the stock.

10. ""$ dnrg - stocks chart fuelcell $ fcel $ bldp $ plug $ cpst $ hygs $ abat $ aapl $ nflx $ pcln $ am zn $ siri $ mnst $ fxcm $ nbg URL"" This is about analyzing stocks, which can affect sentiment if the user thinks it's undervalued or overvalued.

11. ""here's a sneak peek at the watch list members get every morning . enjoy . $ spy $ fb $ googl $ xlf $ wynn $ cmg $ amzn $ aap … URL"" This seems like promotional content, maybe encouraging user engagement but not directly impacting the stock price.

12. ""[ admin ] it's still beta , but i'm about to launch a new chart review website . did $ nflx $ amzn $ aapl $ fb and more . - URL"" Promotional emails often lead to increased user activity and can boost the user base, which might indirectly affect stock price if users are trading.

Now, compiling these thoughts:

- Tweets 1-4: Informing about upcoming developments without direct price changes. Neutral.
- Tweet 5: Positive team collaboration leading to strategic moves. Positive.
- Tweet 6: Similar to 5; collaborative project. Positive.
- Tweet 7: Earnings or financial health suggesting good news. Positive.
- Tweet 8: High-priority statement about competitors. Negative, as others are doomed.
- Tweets 9-12: Encouraging trading and promotional content which could lead to user activity but not direct price changes.

Overall sentiment seems mixed with a few positive tweets and one strong negative tweet."
2015-11-14,Positive,"Alright, I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price and decide whether it's positive, neutral, or negative.

First, let's look at each tweet individually.

1. The first tweet says, ""here's how much amazon's dis will cost apple and google - motley fool URL amazon • $ amzn URL."" It seems like the author is making a trade between Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL). They're suggesting that if AMZN goes down, APPL might go up. This could affect both companies. I'm not sure how this impacts the overall stock price of Amazon, so maybe it's neutral or positive.

2. The second tweet is ""ending another week with multiple wins on swing trades $ kss , $ gmcr , $ aapl , $ spy , $ dia , $ amzn , $ vxx 40 % - 342 % roc d-up ! teamhouse options."" It mentions several stocks and states there were gains of 40% over the week. That sounds like positive news because it's showing significant progress. This could boost Amazon's stock.

3. The third tweet is "" $ amzn - 3 big-brand stocks to own for the next 20 years URL."" The author is suggesting that Amazon should focus on three major brands for their future. This might lead to a shift in Amazon's product strategy, which can impact stock performance. I'm leaning towards this being positive because it shows strategic direction and potential growth.

Now, combining these thoughts: The second tweet has strong positive numbers, the third implies strategic changes that could benefit Amazon, and the first trade is speculative but not explicitly negative. So overall sentiment seems positive."
2015-11-15,Missing,File not found
2015-11-16,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative about a stock. The company mentioned is Amzn (Amazon). Let me go through each tweet one by one.

1. **First tweet**: It says ""vetr inc . upgrades URL to “ hold ” $ amzn URL."" This seems like a URL change, which doesn't impact the stock price much. Probably just annoying or irrelevant for the decision.
   
2. **Second tweet**: Refers to several stocks: spy, goog, nflx, fb, etc., but mentions something about terrorist attacks. That sounds like a negative factor because it's related to security risks and potential threats. So probably negative.

3. Third tweet: Talks about gains in 4 months leading up to an upcoming stock pick. Positive trend for AMZN.
   
4. Fourth tweet: Refers to Tesla, Facebook, Google, etc., saying their price broke a threshold. That's positive because it means they're going up or have good performance.

5. Fifth tweet: Calls out several cryptocurrencies and the VIX index. Cryptocurrencies are generally considered riskier and can be seen as negative by many investors, especially in the tech sector.

6. Sixth tweet: Uses ""one-time"" and ""only,"" which is a strong selling point for future investors. This suggests excitement about upcoming options or deals, indicating positive sentiment.

7. Seventh tweet: Mentions options trading, but doesn't directly talk about AMZN. Still, this shows interest in tech stocks, so maybe neutral? Or slightly positive because it's related to technology.

8. Eighth tweet: Says Amazon has given up some post-earnings gains and is now among big caps with good performance. This reinforces the idea that AMZN is going up.

9. Ninth tweet: Relates to the S&P PEG ratio matching Amazon's, which could indicate a buying opportunity. Positive sentiment.

10. Tenth tweet: Talks about innovative products from tech startups promoted by Amazon. Sounds positive as it suggests growth potential.

Now, combining all these thoughts:
- There are some negative factors (tweets 2 and 5).
- But there are strong positive trends in tweet 4 and 9.
- The one-time emphasis in tweet 6 is a bit of a sell point.
- Overall, the stock seems to be doing well overall because the positive tweets outweigh the negatives.

So I'll lean towards a neutral sentiment, as the impact isn't overwhelmingly positive but shows signs of growth and interest."
2015-11-17,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to analyze the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price and determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll identify the target stock from each tweet. It seems like the main stock mentioned is AMZN because most tweets include terms related to Amazon. But let me check:

1. The first tweet has AMZN and FB, which are both Amazon-related.
2. The second tweet includes FB, NFLX, FB, etc., so again, AMZN.
3. Third tweet mentions AMZN, URLs, etc.
4. Fourth tweet talks about a diabetes ETF, so AMZN is still the primary stock.
5. Fifth tweet mentions AMZN and GBPUSD.
6. Sixth tweet repeats the fifth, mentioning AMZN and GXP.
7. Seventh tweet lists AMZN, DJIA, ENBG,googl, etc., but not sure if it's related to AMZN specifically.
8. Eighth tweet includes AMZN as well.
9. Ninth tweet says ""progressive market"" without specifying, so maybe not directly related.
10. Tenth and eleventh tweets are about other stocks, not AMZN.

So, the main stock I need to focus on is AMZN. Now, let's look at each tweet individually.

1. The first tweet mentions AMZN and FB with some hashtags, but it's unclear if this is a positive or negative trend.
2. Second tweet talks about FB (which is AMZN) moving up 1%, but doesn't specify the impact on AMZN itself.
3. Third tweet mentions AMZN, URLs, stockmarket, etc., suggesting perhaps growth or interest in Amazon.
4. Fourth tweet involves several financial products and ETFs, including FAZ, not related to AMZN.
5. Fifth tweet talks about trending assets, which could be a general sentiment but doesn't directly mention AMZN.
6. Sixth tweet repeats the fifth point, so same as before.
7. Seventh tweet lists other indices but not related to AMZN.
8. Eighth tweet includes AMZN again, but details are unclear.
9. Ninth tweet seems disconnected and ambiguous without context.
10. Tenth and eleventh tweets focus on other stocks.

Looking at these, I notice that several tweets mention AMZN either positively or in the context of trading trends. For example, the third tweet talks about AMZN's stockmarket interest, which might suggest a positive outlook. But others just talk about general market trends without specific mentioning of AMZN performance.

Considering the overall sentiment, there are some positive mentions but less clarity on how these tweets directly affect AMZN's stock price. However, since several tweets like the third and eighth mention AMZN indirectly or in context of broader market interest, it leans towards a possible positive impact despite not having direct information about its current performance."
2015-11-18,Positive,"Okay, let's see. The user has given me a task to analyze some tweets and determine their impact on the stock price of a company. They provided specific instructions, so I need to follow them carefully.

First, they want me to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the tweets, the most common stocks are Tesla (TSLA) since it's mentioned several times, like ""t sell quant $ msft."" So I'll focus on TSLA as my target stock.

Next, for each tweet, I need to separate Positive and Negative factors. Then assess the sentiment towards investor sentiment. Finally, combine these to decide if the overall impact is positive, neutral, or negative.

Looking at tweet 1: It mentions a trade, but it doesn't specify any positive or negative factors about TSLA. It's more of an event update without clear indicators of stock performance. So this tweet might be neutral because it's speculative.

Tweet 2 talks about Fairplay doubling down on customers' safety, which could impact sales, thus affecting sentiment negatively. However, the term ""wayfair"" is a company I'm not sure about, but since it mentions customers and safety, maybe it's a positive factor for consumers? But TSLA isn't mentioned here.

Tweet 3 discusses solar inc., which again doesn't mention TSLA. It seems like just other companies' news unrelated to Tesla.

Tweet 4 talks about SPY breaking above resistance, which could be a bullish signal for TSLA because if SPY is up, it might indicate a strong tech stock. However, it's making big moves and only an increase of $14 over two days, so maybe not enough to significantly impact but still positive.

Tweet 5 is about Amazon taking a long-term view of Wal-Mart, which could affect competition or consumer choices. Since TSLA isn't mentioned here, this might be neutral or slightly negative as it's unrelated.

Tweet 6 talks about Amzn's long-term view on Wal-mart and suggests the same for others. Similar to tweet 5; no mention of TSLA, so probably neutralf.

Tweet 7 is about Netflix introducing Spinnaker, which ties into Amazon but doesn't mention TSLA. So again, unrelated.

Tweet 8 mentions Amzn doubling its earnings over 10 years and trading at 21.9 times EBIT. This seems like a positive metric that could boost confidence in the stock. However, it's a long-term projection with some growth expectations. While this is a positive sign for investors who are waiting to see if that performance holds up.

Tweet 9 talks about Amzn falling from $630 to $664, but then mentions winners' ride, implying potential upside despite the drop. This seems like a mixed signal because it's showing a dip but also hints at future potential, which could be positive.

Overall, most tweets are either unrelated or slightly positive with limited information about TSLA. The only positive tweet is 8 and 9, which might tip the balance towards positive sentiment because of the expected earnings projection."
2015-11-19,Neutral,"Alright, let's figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. The user has provided 14 tweets, so I'll go through each one step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. That seems straightforward since most of them mention ""amzn."" Let me check:

1. ibm dividend yield is approaching 4 % - is it finally a buy ? $ amZN
2. rt AT_USER october 11 , 1985 a comedian died in ny URL via AT_USER $ wtw $ atvi $ amzn $ googl $ tnx $ usd http …

14. rt AT_USER amazon studios launches amazon storywriter , free cloud software for … URL amazon • $ amzn URL

From this list, it's clear that the main stock mentioned is ""amzn."" The rest of the tweets are related to other stocks or topics but mostly focus on Amazon.

Now, let's go through each tweet:

1. ibm dividend yield near 4%: This seems neutral because it's a dividend, which doesn't directly impact Amazon.
2. AT_USER comments about a comedian dying in NY; not relevant to Amazon.
3. Multiple companies like Apple, Microsoft, Tesla mentioned, but nothing specific about Amazon.
4. $700 magnet drawing Amazon employees—this is speculative and could affect sales or revenue, but unclear for stock sentiment yet.
5. Amazon's shares increase by 2500% in one trade; this is positive news for Amazon.
6. AT_USER again talking about a comedian from October 11, 1985; not relevant to Amazon.
7. Morning call with information on Facebook, Waymo, and Amazon; no Amazon info here.
8. Amazon employees planning next positions—no direct impact on stock price yet.
9. Stock message on the dxj index; unrelated to Amazon.
10. Amazon trading for duluth holdings; not directly relevant unless it's related to stock performance, but unclear.
11. amzn shares increase significantly; positive news.
12. Google vs. Amazon and FANG stocks—no direct impact on Amazon's price yet.
13. Amazon plans to open 2 fulfillment centers in Ohio; no stock impact here.
14. Amazon launching a new product (storywriter for Amazon Web Services); this could boost sales but not directly affect the stock price.

Looking at the overall sentiment, most tweets are either neutral or speculative. There's one positive tweet about amzn shares increasing significantly and two more that mention other companies with no direct Amazon impact. The other tweets don't provide substantial information on Amazon's performance.

Given that none of the tweets indicate a clear trend towards buying, selling, or holding stocks, the overall sentiment is neutral. These tweets contribute to broader market sentiment but are not decisive enough to tip the stock price in any direction."
2015-11-20,Positive,"Okay, I need to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll extract the target stock from each tweet. Looking through the tweets, the main companies mentioned are AmZN (Amazon), Google, and Apple (iPod). So my target stocks are AmZN and possibly others like WMT or SPY if they appear in multiple tweets.

Next, I need to assess each tweet for positive or negative factors. Let's go one by one:

1. ""the fangs fb, amzn, nflx, & goog have gained $440b in market cap ytd to carry markets"" – Positive.
2. ""google + express + service + widens + to southern california"" – No obvious positive or negative here; seems neutral.
3. ""sign up for a free stock alert for amzn"" – Positive, as it's encouraging users to invest.
4. ""amzn inc . e . p . s . $amzn $wmt $rsp $lnkd$amzn stock tradeideas"" – Multiple names like WMT and RSP indicate positive aspects of the stock.
5. ""algo trading closing signals : nov / 20 $por (-3.2%) $un (-1.5%) $dre (-4.2%) $abt (2.4%) $lock (3.0%) $amzn (2.8%)"" – Negative because of the closing signals and stock price movements.
6. ""$xrt$ xly $spy$ amzn $wmt $m"" – Multiple tech stocks, but not directly related to Amazon.
7. ""holiday: mobile search outpacing desktop, tablet combined; but shoppers still completing purchase on pc or in-store - rwbaird$amzn$googl"" – Positive as it's about holiday trends favoring mobile devices for shopping and suggesting focus on AmZN.
8. ""$amzn - is gopro inc stock heading to $15 ? one analyst thinks so"" – Positive because of an analyst's opinion, though not a definite trend yet.
9. ""fri, 20 nov 2015 01:35 : 00 gmt top 10 list is out:$gs$ tsla$aapl$amzn$googl..."" – Positive since the top stocks are expected to be increasing.
10. ""$has amazon already won the holiday shopping season?"" – Negative because it's a question suggesting that this period may not be as good as hoped.

Now, I'll tally each tweet:

Positive tweets: 1,3,4,7,9 → 5
Negative tweets: 2,5,10 → 3

Since there are more positive tweets than negative, the overall sentiment leans towards positive. It's important to note that a majority of the positive tweets provide information about upcoming trends and analyst opinions, which can be reassuring for investors."
2015-11-21,Neutral,"Alright, so I need to figure out how these tweets are affecting the stock prices for AMZN and probably other stocks mentioned. Let's go through each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbols: AMZN, FB, GOOGL, PYPL, SQQQ, QQQ, IQW, BABA. The user provided a list of tweets related to these stocks. I need to extract each relevant tweet and analyze them.

Starting with the first tweet: ""earnings for week of 11/23 to 11/27 URL $ spy $ qqq $ iwm $ dia $ aapl $ amzn $ baba stockmarket stocks finance money $ tza"". This seems like a news article or financial update. It mentions several stocks and talks about earnings, which can affect investor sentiment. If there's good news about earnings, it could be positive. However, without specific details on what the earnings are, it's hard to say if it's positive or negative. Maybe I'll consider this as medium to moderate.

Next tweet: ""AT_USER $ amzn will start to give away its echo product to get in your mind to sell you more stuff . the big cos will be listening ."". This sounds like a statement from a user, possibly a influencer, about giving away something. It's vague but mentions customer interaction and media influence. If it's just casual advice without specific implications on stock prices, this could be neutral.

Third tweet: ""rt AT_USER URL ( $ amzn ) and disney ( $ dis ) fighting ... amazon no longer taking disney preorders . URL"". Here, the user is talking about a competition between Amazon and Disney. This can affect both AMZN's performance and possibly others affected by the market, like those in the tech sector. More competition might dilute profits but could also drive prices up if demand rises. So this seems like a mixed signal.

Fourth tweet: ""7 stocks institutional investors bought like crazy in q3 $ amzn $ fb $ goog $ pypl URL via AT_USER"". This mentions that 7 institutions bought 7 different stocks during Q3. Institutional buys can be significant as they often reflect news about their stocks performing well, which can boost the stock price. The term ""like crazy"" might imply strong sentiment towards these investments, making this tweet positive.

Now, combining all these thoughts:

- AMZN is mentioned in several tweets, so its overall impact will have to be considered across multiple sources.
- The user's advice about giving away products and media influence suggests some neutral or even slightly negative sentiment, but not extreme.
- Amazon facing competition with Disney could be moderate positive because more competition might drive prices up if demand increases, especially during peak times like the quarter mentioned.
- Institutional buys indicate strong support among big companies, which is a positive signal for investor confidence.

Putting it all together: The mixed signals from both positive and negative points suggest a neutral overall sentiment. There's some uncertainty but the data points point towards stability rather than extreme movements. So I'll conclude [Neutral]."
2015-11-22,Neutral,"Alright, so I need to analyze these tweets and figure out if they'll have a positive, neutral, or negative impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by breaking down each tweet step by step.

First, I remember that the user provided four tweets. Wait, no, actually, looking again, there are six tweets in total. Let me list them again to make sure I'm not missing any.

1. ""rt URL pep pepsico , inc . tick URL $ pep $ amzn $ atvi $ drn pep finance stocks""
2. ""amznabercrombie & fitch co . last trade URL $ amzn $ tmv $ himx $ xiv amzn stockmarket investing""
3. ""oih market vectors oil services market cap URL $ oih $ tjx $ clf $ amzn oih tradeideas stock""
4. ""r3 = 683 r2 = 676 r1 = 672 $ amzn pivot = 665 s1 = 661 s2 = 654 s3 = 650""
5. ""rt AT_USER 2016 will also be the year of fang - - the motley fool $ amzn URL URL URL""
6. ""$ amzn - apple tv , amazon fire tv , or roku 4 : which should you buy this holiday season ? URL""

Okay, so six tweets in total. Let me tackle them one by one.

Starting with tweet 1: It looks like it's a link to some stock info. The term ""tick URL"" suggests they're probably searching for prices on a platform, maybe Yahoo Finance or something similar. So this might just be providing information and not affecting the stock price directly. Maybe just curiosity rather than an update.

Next is tweet 2: ""amznabercrombie & fitch co . last trade URL $ amzn $ tmv $ himx $ xiv amzn stockmarket investing."" Hmm, abercrombie and Fitch are a brand name, not related to Amazon. The word ""last trade"" might refer to the trading activity or price movement. But since this is about their stock market investing, it could indicate sentiment about the company's performance. However, it's more of a comment on market news rather than something directly impacting Amazon.

Tweet 3: ""oih market vectors oil services market cap URL $ oih $ tjx $ clf $ amzn oih trade ideas stock."" Again, this seems to be providing information via a URL, possibly about market trends or stock info. It's not explicitly negative or positive towards Amazon; it might be about broader market movements.

Tweet 4: ""r3 = 683 r2 = 676 r1 = 672 $ amzn pivot = 665 s1 = 661 s2 = 654 s3 = 650."" This looks like numbers that might be related to some metric, maybe something like a score or ranking. The user is probably using a scoring system where higher values mean better performance. If these numbers are positive and increasing, it could signal improvement. But I'm not entirely sure what ""pivot"" refers to here—maybe market conditions? This tweet seems more about internal metrics than external factors.

Tweet 5: ""rt AT_USER 2016 will also be the year of fang - - the motley fool $ amzn URL URL URL."" The user is making a joke in English, saying that 2016 is the year FANG might come out. This tweet is more on a humorous note and doesn't seem to directly impact Amazon's stock price.

Tweet 6: ""$ amzn - apple tv , amazon fire tv , or roku 4 : which should you buy this holiday season ? URL."" Another link, possibly for product recommendations or market insights. It seems like they're advising users about products that could be bought around the holiday season, possibly related to electronics since ""apple TV,"" ""amazon fire TV,"" and ""robook 4"" are all TV brands.

Now, putting it all together: The tweets don't seem to provide actionable information or cause any significant shifts in market sentiment. They're either providing links for product recommendations or general stock info that might be unrelated. Most of them are just informational without positive or negative cues about Amazon's stock price.

So, considering the overall impact, none of these tweets indicate a clear trend towards improvement, decline, or neutrality. They might have some engagement with users but don't present anything actionable for investors."
2015-11-23,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price and determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative. Let me start by going through each tweet one by one.

First, the user mentions ""rt AT_USER $ amzn 710 next ?"". That seems like a question about whether Amazon is due for a significant increase of $710. I'm not entirely sure what that means in terms of stock price or market movement, but maybe it's just an open-ended query.

Next, the tweet starts with ""$ bac news : "" and lists several stocks, followed by some URLs. It seems to be providing information about upcoming events related to these companies. Since it mentions upcoming news, I can't tell much from this unless it talks about earnings or something else that would affect Amazon's stock price.

The fourth tweet is similar: ""$ fred $ amzn $ tts $ chs"". Again, it lists stocks and URLs but doesn't provide specific information that would impact the company. So, no immediate impact here either.

Looking at the fifth tweet, there are some stock names like AGN, PFE, APLX, AMZN, etc., with percentage changes. This seems more actionable because it's giving specific stock performance data. Amazon is mentioned with a -3.17% drop and +1.51%, which suggests that the tweet could be indicating a slight decline in their price relative to competitors. That might indicate concern about the market sentiment towards Amazon or potential economic factors affecting them.

The first two tweets are more open-ended, so they might not provide concrete information about Amazon's stock. They just pose questions or lists without any specific context. So, it's hard to assess the impact from these.

Putting it all together: The fifth tweet has a mix of positive (some increases) and negative (some decreases) movements in competitors. But since it only mentions Amazon with a slight increase, I don't have enough information about other factors affecting Amazon's stock price. Therefore, the overall sentiment seems mixed but leaning towards some concern due to potential market reactions from these stock changes.

So, considering all this, I think there might be some uncertainty and doubt in the stock price of Amazon, so the conclusion is probably negative."
2015-11-24,Negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out how these tweets are affecting Amazon's stock price based on the given guidelines. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

Starting with the first tweet: ""replay : amazon hits all-time high URL $ amzn"". It mentions that Amazon has hit its all-time high and is being replied about it. That sounds like positive news because hitting a milestone is usually a good sign for investors. So, this seems positive.

The second tweet talks about other stocks like spy, dia, qqq, etc., going up despite having zero volume every day. High volume doesn't necessarily mean anything, but the fact that multiple stocks are doing well might suggest some underlying trend or market sentiment. It's vague and not very specific, so it's hard to tell if this is positive or negative right now.

The third tweet mentions that Amazon's stock is sliding due to a potential password leak. Passwords in URLs can sometimes be bad because they're sensitive information. If there's a leak, it could lead to security issues affecting the company's operations and potentially impacting its stock price. This adds uncertainty but might have negative effects on Amazon.

The fourth tweet looks like it's about AT_USER targeting Amazon as ""top ten out-of-the-money calls"" with strikes between 690-710. This seems more technical, possibly related to trading strategies or news about Amazon's financials. Without more context, it's hard to assess the sentiment here.

The fifth tweet mentions that Amazon is going up because of movements in several assets like $amzn, $cbg, etc., and talks about options and trading. This could indicate a favorable market outlook, which would be positive for Amazon.

Sixth tweet says AMZN is coming out of the lunch hour with some bounces, but it's obvious that things might slow down. The mention of ""bumps"" can sometimes lead to temporary gains or corrections in markets, so this isn't definitive negative news either.

Seventh tweet talks about a gain from movement in certain assets, suggesting that when prices move up, Amazon is doing well. This could indicate a positive trend but needs more context for sure.

Eighth tweet mentions AT_USER targeting AMZN with out-of-the-money calls and options trading. Again, this seems technical and might not have immediate market impact without specific details on what's happening in the real world.

Ninth tweet discusses Google's plans to crush Amazon in online shopping. If Google is a major competitor, it can significantly affect Amazon's stock price. This seems like negative news because Google's dominance could hurt AMZN.

Tenth tweet says AMZN is about to go up based on volume and mentions Eum and GS. Volume increases are typically good signs, so this is positive for Amazon.

Eleventh and twelfth tweets are duplicates of each other with the same content. They mention that the top 10 list for GSPC has been released but aren't specific to AMZN. Without more details, it's hard to tell if this affects AMZN's performance or not.

Putting all these together: The first tweet is definitely positive. The third and ninth tweets add some uncertainty about Amazon being affected by a potential security breach. There are several positive tweets about AMZN going up due to various factors like volume increases and tech-related news. However, the seventh and ninth tweets might have some negative elements.

Since there's a mix of positive and somewhat uncertain information, it's a bit hard to say for sure if it's overall positive or neutral. It depends on how significant the negative aspect (the potential password leak) is compared to the other positives."
2015-11-25,Positive,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and figure out if they're going to positively or negatively impact a stock price. The target is [Stock Symbol] which isn't specified yet, but maybe it's something like AmZN or Tesla based on the tweets.

Let me go through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions stock prices of companies like Aapl, Amgn, Amtn, Amzn, etc., and talks about trades in NASDAQ from 2011 up to a 190% increase. That sounds like positive information because it's showing growth over time. Positive factors could boost investor confidence.

2. The second tweet is about the best performing S&P 500 stocks year-over-year. It mentions multiple companies and gives their URLs, so this seems to be providing info on which sectors are hot right now. This directly relates to the company in question, adding value. So positive sentiment likely comes from confirming performance.

3. Third tweet is just a general greeting about the weekend. No specific information, maybe neutral because it's not giving any significant data or analysis. It might not affect stock price much unless it's a trend indicating more trading or interest, which could be neutral.

4. Fourth tweet talks about Tesla and other companies selling their products or using algorithms to trigger sells on sigma-x, crossfinder, ats, lx. This sounds like technical analysis suggesting that the company is trying to generate cash or exit positions. Depending on whether this is positive or negative for investors, it can influence stock prices. If it's a signal from management about growth, it might be positive.

5. Fifth tweet asks about holiday shopping options, mentioning products and services like Amzn, eBay, etc., and some specific companies. This could indicate interest in new tech products during the holiday season, which might boost consumer demand and thus stock prices. Positive sentiment here too.

Putting this together, the tweets mention growth trends, specific company performance, technical actions by the company (like selling shares), and increasing consumer interest for holiday shopping. These all seem to be positive signals that could positively impact the stock price."
2015-11-26,Positive,"Okay, I need to analyze these tweets to determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet one by one.

1. The first tweet mentions Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals for major retailers like Amazon, Apple, Walmart, Target, and others. I know that Black Friday is a big shopping holiday where consumers buy last year’s products. Offering deals early might encourage more purchases, which could boost sales and stock price. This seems positive.

2. The second tweet talks about Kbio, a pharmaceuticals company, and its stock performance. While the tweet mentions the company but doesn't specify any immediate actions or updates on Amazon's stock. However, it's just talking about the company and stock prices in general. I don't have enough info to assess this one clearly.

3. The third tweet talks about AT_USER offering Black Friday deals, which is similar to the first tweet. It seems like a marketing strategy from the user's perspective, but again, not giving specific details on how it affects Amazon’s stock or customer sentiment.

4. The fourth tweet just says $ amzn what not to buy on black friday URL. This doesn't provide any information about the company or its performance, so it's hard to tell if this is positive or negative towards Amazon's stock price.

So, out of these four tweets, only the first one seems directly related and indicates a likely positive impact on Amazon's stock because they're talking about sales strategies during major holidays. The others either lack specific information or are speculative."
2015-11-27,Missing,File not found
2015-11-28,Positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out whether the given tweets are going to be positive, neutral, or negative in terms of impact on Amazon's future stock price. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the tweet: ""us analyst lifts $2015 eps estimates for url amazon.com inc url nasdaq."" The key here is that it mentions an analyst lifting their estimates for Amazon's 2015 earnings. I remember that analysts' earnings estimates are a significant indicator of investor sentiment because they can affect how companies are viewed in the market.

So, if Amazon has been doing well and their earnings are expected to improve, this could be positive news. Analysts giving an enthusiastic update about future performance is usually seen as encouraging investment. It suggests that the company's prospects look bright for the future.

Now, considering factors: Positive factors here include improved earnings estimates from analysts, which might mean customers or the market expects Amazon to perform better in the coming year. The negative factor isn't directly mentioned, but if the analyst is optimistic, it could lead to positive sentiment.

Moreover, since this tweet comes from an analyst, and the focus on future performance can lead to increased demand for Amazon products or services, which would boost their stock price. This expectation that Amazon will meet higher earnings targets can make investors feel more confident in the company, leading to a positive outlook.

I should also think about the market's general sentiment. If other analysts are optimistic and consistent, it could add to the overall positivity of the market. The mention of $2015 estimates might indicate that this is a specific, upcoming year, so the focus isn't on past performance but future potential.

Putting it all together: The tweet presents improved expectations for Amazon's earnings, which typically signals positive trends in financials. This can lead to investors feeling more optimistic about the company's future prospects and thus have a positive impact on their stock price."
2015-11-29,Neutral,"Alright, let me analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of Amazon (AMZN). 

First, I need to extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. The first few tweets mention ""mu micron technology , inc . prev close URL mu $"" and similar phrases, which don't directly specify AMZN. Wait, looking again, some tweets do mention AMZN specifically. For example, tweet 1 says ""amzn $ retl $ yinn mu investing tradeideas."" Hmm, but the other tweets also discuss AMZN. Let me check each one:

1. mu micron technology , inc . prev close URL mu $ amzn $ retl $ yinn mu investing tradeideas - This includes AMZN.
2. now working on new trades in these symbols this week . $ msft $ aapl $ baba $ amzn and $ fb URL URL - Includes AMZN.
3. rt AT_USER weekend review video ( 11/29 ): $ spy $ iwm $ qqq $ fxi $ baba $ bidu $ aapl $ amzn $ cmg $ fb $ googl $ nflx $ pcln $ nke $ ua $ di … URL - Includes AMZN.
4. rt AT_USER the two best nasdaq - 100 stocks , so far • $ nflx + 157 % • $ amzn + 116 % chart : URL URL - Yes, AMZN is mentioned here.
5. $ amzn $ aa options have the largest change in open interest . free options screener . URL
6. rt AT_USER china rate cut + $ goog $ amzn $ msft = "" rally fever on wall street "" says AT_USER URL URL - Includes AMZN.
7. $ mhrc has nearly quadrupled in value , in the past 2 weeks ! special update : URL $ orcl $ yhoo $ amzn
8. top trade patterns in stock ... Cheer . $ study $ aapl $ baba $ fb $ xom $ cvx $ amzn $ goog $ msft $ ibm $ mon stockmarket URL - Yes, AMZN is mentioned.
9. which will be the first trillion dollar company ? $ aapl $ goog $ fb $ amzn learn more : URL

All tweets include ""AMZN"" in some form. Now I need to assess the impact of each tweet on Amazon's stock price.

Looking at tweet 1: It talks about mu micron technology and other companies, but there's no direct information on AMZN or its performance. So this seems neutral because it doesn't provide any specific data or analysis related to AMZN's stock.

Similarly, tweets 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 mention AMZN but without explicit sentiment indicators like positive or negative. They focus on upcoming trades, stock performance metrics, or news about the company. Since they don't present any positive or negative insights or predictions, each of these is likely neutral.

However, tweet 4 mentions ""the two best nasdaq - 100 stocks , so far • $ nflx + 157 % • $ amzn + 116 % chart :"" which might suggest that AMZN has had a positive trend. But since the information is presented in a way that implies performance rather than explicit sentiment, it's still neutral because there's no direct mention of a rise or fall.

Overall, all tweets don't provide concrete evidence about Amazon's stock price. They focus on upcoming trades and company performance metrics but without any positive or negative keywords. Therefore, the impact is neutral."
2015-11-30,Positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol in each tweet. The first tweet mentions $mhrc gaining 756%, which is a significant increase. That sounds like positive news because gains are often good for investors. So mhrc is clearly a positive factor here.

Moving to the second tweet, it talks about Amazon being underestimated when they talk about their products or services. It says the user thinks they're underestimating and refers to ""killing bricks & mortar."" The word ""killing"" suggests that people are saying Amazon doesn't have as much value as they think. So from a sentiment perspective, this seems negative because it's questioning the company's standing.

The third tweet mentions that URL receives a buy rating from axiom securities. A positive action could mean that the stock is performing well or getting bought up by investors. So, both buys and sells in the same tweet... Hmm, not entirely clear yet. It might be ambiguous, but if it says it receives a buy rating, maybe the sentiment is leaning towards positive.

Now, putting this together: mhrc is positive, Amazon's underestimate is negative, and there's some ambiguity on URL buying. But considering that $mhrc could be related to Amazon or another company, I need to see how these factors tie in collectively. If mhrc leads to an increase in Amazon's stock due to their performance, but people are questioning the value of Amazon elsewhere, it might not be a clear overall positive.

I should consider each tweet separately first and then combine them for the overall sentiment. Each has its own perspective, so I don't think they can be combined directly. However, if mhrc is a significant event that positively impacts Amazon, and there's some uncertainty about the market perception of Amazon (which the second tweet seems to hint at), it might lean towards a positive overall impact because someone is buying Amazon but also seeing some good news elsewhere.

But wait, the user wrote the output as [Neutral], so maybe I should stick with that. They consideredmhrc and URL but didn't combine them properly. Maybe mhrc isn't directly related to Amazon's stock but is a separate company in the tweets. So if neither positive nor negative seems clear when combined without context about how they affect each other, it might be neutral.

Alternatively, since mhrc gain is a significant positive, which could indicate good news for Amazon, and while there's some uncertainty on Amazon's valuation, maybe the overall sentiment leans towards [Neutral] because the two factors aren't directly in line with Amazon's stock performance."
2015-12-01,Positive,"Okay, I need to determine whether these tweets indicate a positive, neutral, or negative impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, for each tweet, I'll identify the factors—positive and negative. Then, assess how each factor might influence investor sentiment. Finally, combine all this information into an overall sentiment summary.

1. ""barclays believes amzn still has room to grow $ amzn URL""
- Positive: Barclay's mention of growth is optimistic.
- Negative: No explicit negative factors here, just a positive outlook on growth.
- Sentiment: This seems positive because it gives investors信心 that Amazon might be able to grow.

2. ""$ amzn news : "" grab some breakfast , it's time for premarket prep ! we're talking … "" URL analyze : url
- Positive: General announcement about the start of the premarket prep, which is a good signal.
- Negative: No negative factors mentioned here.
- Sentiment: Strong positive because it's a general update that's important to investors.

3. ""rt AT_USER amazon unveils its latest delivery drone prototype $ amzn URL""
- Positive: New product launch is usually seen as positive by investors, especially if it's a key advantage like data or tech-related.
- Negative: No negative factors mentioned here.
- Sentiment: This is a strong positive because the announcement of a new product can boost confidence and expectations.

4. ""what you need to know about the new AT_USER drone URL amazondrone $ amzn URL""
- Positive: Similar to tweet 3, it's another product announcement which adds support for the stock.
- Negative: No negative factors here.
- Sentiment: The positive note from the product launch.

5. ""rt AT_USER barclays sees three of four fang stocks continuing outperformance $ amzn $ nflx $ goog $ googl $ fb : full story URL""
- Positive: Barclay's outlook on multiple companies is encouraging, suggesting growth potential.
- Negative: No explicit negative factors mentioned here.
- Sentiment: The positive outlook from a key company reinforces investor confidence.

6. ""csco chevron corp . day high URL $ csco $ amzn $ nugt $ googl csco stocks tradeideas""
- Positive: CSCO has reached a day high, which is a strong indicator of potential growth.
- Negative: No negative factors here.
- Sentiment: This positive news suggests potential for the stock to rise.

Now, combining all these tweets. Each one either provides positive information about Amazon or points towards a positive outlook elsewhere. The word ""three of four fang stocks"" in tweet 5 is a strong positive sign that others might perform well. CSCO reaching a high also adds strength. The product announcements and the day high both support an upward trend.

So, all these tweets collectively suggest that Amazon's stock is expected to go up."
2015-12-02,Negative,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, the target stock is Amazon (AMZN), identified from the text. Now, looking at each tweet individually.

1. The first tweet mentions that the user is scared of people leaving their homes, especially kids, due to high prices. This seems like a negative sentiment because it's about safety and avoiding money. So, this could be seen as negative.

2. The second tweet talks about Amazon being the top performer in the S&P 500 with an 117% gain. While that's positive news for AMZN, the user is concerned about misleading information (URL). But the main takeaway here is the gain, which might be a sign of market confidence rather than negative sentiment.

3. The third tweet is similar to the second one. It mentions a high stock performance and specific URLs but doesn't provide any additional information. Still, the focus on AMZN's performance can indicate positive trends that could benefit the stock price.

4. The fourth tweet describes the behavior of buyers at Amazon's stock exchange. It says buyers like those who came to the drug party early and wait for a police raid. This seems like it's talking about stock trading in a panic, which would likely be negative sentiment because it's creating anxiety or fear among investors.

5. The fifth tweet lists several companies related to $ AMZN with URLs, but nothing explicit about Amazon. It doesn't seem to provide any information that would impact the stock price negatively or positively right now. So this tweet is neutral in this context.

6. The sixth tweet suggests buying $ AMZN if a specific event happens—like a drumstick game being played on $ AMZN and then possibly going down. This could be seen as speculative investment advice, which might indicate uncertainty but not necessarily negative sentiment towards the stock itself.

7. The seventh tweet refers to Cyber Monday, suggesting that it should be called ""Amazon Day"" with specific links. Again, this is talking about a general event rather than a direct impact on $ AMZN's performance or price changes.

8. The eighth tweet talks about the user having been buying dips for the last year and recommends a new strategy if they haven't already. This could imply that the stock has shown downward trends in recent months, which might be positive news but not necessarily indicative of future performance.

9. Tweets 9, 10, and 11 discuss stock performance metrics like HFT algorithms, trading volume, and price movements. These are technical aspects that can affect stock prices, but unless there's specific information about the company's fundamentals or financial health, it might be considered neutral.

10. The tenth tweet mentions $ APEX (AMZN) breaking certain price targets with various indices. While this could indicate a potential buying trend, without more context on what these targets are for and how they relate to AMZN's performance, it's hard to assess the impact on the stock price negatively or positively.

11. The eleventh tweet also mentions $ APEX's trading volume relative to others. Again, while this can influence prices, there's no direct information about AMZN, so it's considered neutral in this context.

Summarizing each tweet:
- Tweets 1, 2, 3: Negative due to panic selling and lack of specifics.
- Tweet 4: Negative from fear of a police raid and market anxiety.
- Tweets 5,6,7,8,9,10,11: Neutral because they're technical or speculative but not directly affecting AMZN's stock price.

Therefore, the overall sentiment would be a mix of negative from some tweets and neutral from others. It might lean towards a more cautious approach given the general comments."
2015-12-03,Negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets regarding the stock price impact for the company.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""american retail is about 2 things : amazon and everyone else URL economy retail investing stockmarket $ amzn"". Hmm, that seems a bit unclear. It mentions ""amazon"" as one of two things, so maybe the stock symbol is AMZN.

The second tweet starts with ""$ amzn still building a shell , but today's gains weren't long lied 7 failed to make a new high … highs are poor !"" This looks like it's talking about Amazon's performance. The phrase ""highs are poor"" suggests that the company isn't doing well, which might indicate a negative sentiment.

Third tweet is ""rt AT_USER think or swim training video is live URL $ spy $ qqq $ dia $ iwm $ baba $ aapl $ fb $ gdx $ uso $ twtr $ amzn $ …"". This tweet mentions several stocks like SPY (SPX), QQQ, etc., which are all stock indexes. The mention of a ""training video"" might indicate that the company is investing or strategic in one of their areas, but without more details, it's hard to tell if this is positive or negative.

But focusing on AMZN, the second tweet is clearly talking about its performance and mentions poor highs. That sounds like it's negative. The first tweet also says ""stockmarket $ amzn"", which aligns with AMZN as the target stock.

Putting it together, since AMZN is in two tweets: one negative from the second tweet and possibly more context in the third that doesn't directly affect AMZN, I think the overall sentiment leans negative."
2015-12-04,Positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet mentions that Amazon is differentiating its supply chain and expects big dividends like Wal-Mart. I know companies with strong revenue growth tend to have higher stock prices, so this seems positive.

2. The second tweet talks about creating 211,000 jobs in November with a unemployment rate of 5%. More jobs are good for the economy, which can lead to better company performance and potentially higher stock price.

3. The third tweet is about Tesla powerwalls, which could impact the home battery market. While not directly related to Amazon, it's part of the broader tech sector, so this could be positive or negative depending on how other companies are doing in their own right.

4. The fourth tweet mentions a dividend and specific stocks like AmZN, Avgo, DBC, and NVDA. Dividends can increase investor confidence, which might boost stock prices, especially if they're seen as stable.

5. The fifth tweet talks about AMZN being between the 10-day moving average and the Wildcard Index on a particular week. This could indicate that AMZN is near support or resistance levels, affecting investor sentiment based on how it's positioned relative to these technical indicators.

6. The sixth tweet is talking about midstream companies like KMI and ARD. If they're mentioned, this could be negative if the company is facing issues in the transportation sector, which might impact AMZN's sales or profitability.

7. The seventh tweet discusses AMZN stock on penny stocks with some positive news. Penny stocks can drive prices up, but depending on how well the overall market and other companies are performing.

8. The eighth tweet mentions AT_USER announcing 4K adaptive streaming is rolling out to select users. More new services or partnerships often lead to growth, which could boost AMZN's stock price.

9. The ninth tweet provides opinions from UCO about their product on December 3, 2015. This seems like a specific event that might not have a broad impact unless it affects AMZN's operations.

10. The tenth tweet talks about AMZN focusing on key areas and watching for more pullbacks if the low violates certain conditions. If AMZN is moving lower due to poor performance, this could be negative news affecting prices.

11. The eleventh tweet seems like a casual comment from AT_USER regarding Amazon's prime offerings and delivery services. It's less likely to have a significant impact unless there are specific trends or issues related to that service.

Putting it all together, the main factors seem positive with some minor negatives in areas like job creation, midstream companies, pullbacks, and specific product mentions. These factors could contribute to mixed sentiment but leaning more towards positive due to overall economic indicators."
2015-12-05,Positive,"Alright, let's analyze these tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of the company in question.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. The first tweet mentions ""julia child"" and talks about investing in the French chef for $29 bucks on Amazon. It suggests spending thousands at a culinary school, which is more expensive than the immediate investment they're considering. This seems like it could be a positive sign because it's about practicality and avoiding unnecessary expenses.

The second tweet lists several exchanges with symbols: $ amzn, $ amgn, $ vxx, $ goro. These are all stock tickers for Amazon and other tech companies. Without specific information on what the tweets discuss, it's hard to assess the sentiment. It just looks like a list of prices and company names. The context isn't clear enough to determine if these tweets will lead to positive, neutral, or negative actions.

Now, focusing on the first tweet: ""the french chef "" for 29 bucks on $ amzn is probably more worthwhile than spending thousands at a culinary school."" This tweet presents a value proposition by suggesting that investing in the French Chef at 29 might be better than paying a thousand dollars to learn culinary arts. The reasoning here seems strategic and practical, which could influence investor sentiment positively.

Since the second tweet doesn't provide any specific information about the company or its current state, it's challenging to evaluate its impact on the stock price without additional context. However, based on the first tweet alone, there might be a bit of optimism because it's suggesting an investment that isn't excessively costly.

But given the lack of information from the second tweet, I have to make a judgment call. The first tweet provides some positive outlook, which is a sign that could boost the stock price, but without more context or specific details, it's hard to be certain. It might lean towards a slight positive impact, but not sure.

I'll go with [Positive] because the tweet presents a value proposition suggesting an investment in practical terms rather than excessive expense."
2015-12-06,Positive,"Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, I have these two tweets about stock prices and I need to analyze their impact on the company's future stock price by determining whether they're positive, neutral, or negative.

First, I need to extract the stock symbol from each tweet. Looking at the first tweet: ""markyusko value trounced growth names in 2000-2001 ? buy $ symc and $ csco vs . short $ amzn and $ fb URL"". Hmm, that's a bit confusing. The word ""symc"" isn't a stock symbol I recognize. Maybe it's a typo or something else. Let me check the second tweet: ""rt AT_USER remember the financial crisis ? big tech stocks since $ nflx +2,800 % $ amzn +900 % $ aapl +600 % $ googl +200 % chart : URL"". This one has specific stock symbols like nflx, amzn, aapl, and googl. So maybe the first tweet was about another stock, but it's hard to figure out what it stands for.

Assuming that I'm missing the stock symbol from the first tweet, perhaps there's some context or more information needed here. But without knowing which stock is being referred to, it's tricky. Maybe the user made a typo, and the second tweet provides the correct information. Alternatively, maybe ""symc"" was meant to be something else.

Given that I can only work with the tweets as provided, perhaps I should focus on the second tweet first since it clearly mentions stock symbols: nflx, amzn, aapl, googl. Let's move on to that because it seems more concrete.

Looking at the second tweet: ""rt AT_USER remember the financial crisis ? big tech stocks since $ nflx +2,800 % $ amzn +900 % $ aapl +600 % $ googl +200 % chart : URL"". The user is responding to a query about remembering the financial crisis and mentions that big tech stocks have performed exceptionally well. The percentages are very high: nflx up 2,800%, amzn 900%, aapl 600%, googl 200%. These are significant gains, which could indicate strong market sentiment.

The tweet uses the word ""remember"" in a positive context about the financial crisis and encourages big tech stocks to perform well. The percentages suggest strong positive growth among these stocks. Combining these factors, it seems like there's a positive sentiment pushing investors to buy these stocks despite the financial crisis.

Now, considering the first tweet: If I can't get the stock symbol from that, maybe I should look at any possible context or other information. But since only two tweets are provided and one is incomplete, perhaps the user intended for me to focus on the second one which clearly indicates strong positive sentiment toward big tech stocks.

Putting it all together, the response in the second tweet suggests a positive overall sentiment towards these stock symbols, despite the financial crisis. Therefore, I would conclude that this tweet has a positive impact on the company's stock price."
2015-12-07,Positive,"Okay, I need to figure out how to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. The first tweet is about updated reviews from Amazon for December 6, 2015. That seems like a specific date and maybe some content related to their reviews or product updates that could affect consumer sentiment. The word ""amazing"" in the URL might indicate positive information.

The second tweet mentions the S&P 500 testing a moving average of 50 days, specifically for SPX. While this is about market trends, it's more about technical analysis rather than stock performance. It doesn't directly mention Amazon's products or shares, so I'm not sure how that affects the stock price.

I'll start by looking at each tweet individually. The first one talks about reviews updating, which could mean customer satisfaction and positive news that might boost investor confidence. That would likely have a Positive impact on Amazon's stock because more investors might be willing to pay a higher price for their shares.

The second tweet is about the S&P 500 testing an MA of 50 days. I'm not entirely sure what that means in terms of market trends, but it could indicate investor interest or sentiment about the market direction. However, since it's unrelated to Amazon's products or shares, it might have a Neutral effect on the stock price.

Considering both tweets together, the first one has some positive information about reviews and possibly future product updates, while the second is about market trends. Both seem like they could influence investor sentiment positively because they provide relevant data points for decision-making, even if the second tweet isn't directly about Amazon. So overall, the stock might be going up."
2015-12-08,Positive,"Okay, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a company. Let's go through each tweet step by step.

1. The first tweet mentions ""the big picture"" and includes several dollar symbols, so it seems like it might be making broad statements about the market. It could be positive or neutral depending on what it says specifically.
2. The second tweet talks about a float of $2 million and mentions several stocks. This is probably a minor update without specific context, so I'm not sure yet.
3. The third tweet questions whether a threat to Walmart's stock is worrying for Amazon. This seems like a direct threat analysis, which could be negative if it implies serious concerns.
4. The fourth tweet suggests that Alphabet needs Chromecast to increase advertising audience, which is related to their streaming services. This indicates a strategic or potential benefit, making the sentiment positive.
5. The fifth tweet mentions alphabet expanding its ads through chromecast and expects more users. This is a positive outlook on their future marketing efforts, so it's likely positive.
6. The sixth tweet talks about a potential return of 55% over 100% but states that AmZN is undervalued compared to several companies. This seems like a negative sentiment because if the stock is undervalued, investors might fear it will drop.
7. The seventh tweet mentions receiving an alert and stocks trading on NYSE or NASDAQ. Trading activity can indicate market confidence or uncertainty, which is typically positive.
8. The eighth tweet questions whether Costco's stock could outperform in 2016. This seems like a speculative analysis about future performance, so it might be neutral because it depends on actual data.
9. The ninth tweet mentions assets increasing and specific stocks. Again, this is more of an update than analysis with limited context.

Putting it all together: positive tweets indicate optimism (4,5,7), while negative ones are 3,6,8. The overall sentiment seems to have a mix but leans towards positive due to some solid statements."
2015-12-09,Positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out the impact of these tweets on the stock price of a given company. Let me go through each tweet one by one and analyze their potential effects.

1. The first tweet mentions market environment analysis but doesn't provide any specific information or predictions about the stock. So it seems neutral.
2. Second tweet talks about e-books and aims to predict the future of reading, which is a positive trend for some investors, especially those interested in non-traditional media. This could positively influence the stock.
3. Third tweet discusses gains with 2% returns and mentions certain stocks but without specifics on how they affect Amzn or FB. It's still neutral because it doesn't give enough info.
4. Fourth tweet from Matthew discusses a company's performance, specifically holding and buying new shares. This might indicate confidence in the stock and could be positive.
5. Fifth tweet is a comment from Matthew about AmZN doing well with a $2% gain. It sounds optimistic and directly relates to the stock price impact.
6. Sixth tweet talks about ads on Amzn, which are typically seen as good signs because they attract users. This seems positive for the company.
7. Seventh tweet sets a target range for Amzn's price at $660 and Google at $750. If the stock is expected to reach these levels, it could be a strong buy signal.
8. Eighth tweet mentions switching strategies like a FANG stock but doesn't provide details on how this affects Amzn or FB. Neutral because no specifics are given.
9. Ninth tweet discusses AT_USER targeting other streaming services. This could attract more subscribers and increase revenue if AT_USER is successful, which might boost Amzn's performance positively.
10. Tenth tweet talks about Amzn increasing its price from 800 to 850 points. A significant jump could indicate confidence in the stock's strength and may be positive for investors.
11. Eleventh tweet mentions alerts from Amzn on stock trading, which might lead to further movement in the stock price and thus impact the sentiment positively.
12. Twelfth tweet reviews semiconductor stocks but doesn't specify how Amzn relates to them. So it remains neutral.
13. Thirteenth tweet about e-commerce companies' share distribution to Wal-Mart, which could indicate a strategic move that might benefit Amzn or related companies.
14. Fourteenth tweet is an introductory comment without specific information on Amzn.

Now, compiling the analysis: The tweets mention potential price increases (second, fifth, seventh, ninth, tenth, eleventh), specific targets (sixth, twelfth), and strategic moves (twelfth, thirteenth). These all show positive intentions or expectations for future performance. Each tweet suggests optimism about Amzn's growth, which is a good sign for the stock. Therefore, the overall sentiment is positive."
2015-12-10,Negative,"Alright, let me go through this step by step. I have to analyze the tweets to determine their impact on the stock price of the given company.

First, I need to figure out the target stock from the tweets. Scanning through them, it looks like ""amzn"" is mentioned multiple times in a few of them, especially lines 1-5. So, amzn is likely the target stock.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one and break them down into factors—positive and negative. 

Starting with tweet 1: It mentions 'fcx freeport-mcmoran' which doesn't seem relevant to amzn. The rest of the text seems unrelated except for some URLs and dates, so probably no significant information here.

Tweet 2 is about big data from 2015-2016. That's more in the past, but since it's an analysis tweet, maybe it can influence investor sentiment indirectly. However, I'm not sure if this directly relates to amzn's performance yet.

Tweets 3 and 4 both mention 'xrt' which is related to the middle class dying in America. This could be a negative sign because it affects consumer spending power, which might lower stock prices. The fact that they're on social media (RT) suggests it's being monitored, so maybe investors are cautious.

Tweets 5 and 6 repeat 'xrt' again, probably adding to the negative sentiment or reinforcing it by posting multiple times.

Tweet 7 is another 'xrt' tweet from the same source. It reinforces the middle class decline, which could lead to a more negative overall sentiment.

Tweets 8-13 mention various stock indices and unrelated topics like 'optionstrading', so not relevant unless there's a connection I'm missing.

Tweets 9-10 are similar to tweet 7, further reinforcing the negative factors. 

Tweet 11 is another 'xrt' tweet. Maybe it's an attempt to spread negativity by posting multiple times or using hashtags?

Tweets 12 is about amzn options being priced too high. This could indicate that the stock might dip as investors are scared of higher volatility from options trading, which could be seen as a negative factor.

However, I'm not entirely sure if this is a clear indicator of an overall positive, neutral, or negative impact on amzn's price.

Tweets 13-18 mention 'optionstrading' again and other unrelated stocks. It seems like most tweets are either related to market trends or speculative topics, which might not directly correlate with amzn's performance.

In summary, the main negative signs seem to be the middle class decline and the overpriced options stock, but without concrete information about amzn's earnings or other positive factors that could offset these negatives, it's hard to decide a clear overall sentiment. It feels like a mix of negative signals, making me lean towards [Negative], but maybe there are signs I'm missing."
2015-12-11,Positive,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze these tweets to determine their likely impact on a company's stock price. The user provided a set of tweets and some specific instructions on how to process them. Let me go through this step by step.

First, the target is to identify each tweet's factors as positive or negative and assess sentiment. Then combine everything to decide if it's positive, neutral, or negative overall. 

Looking at the first tweet: ""rt $ qqq hft algos triggered buy in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 11:07 , p / t 114.00 quant $ msft $ gpro $ goog $ amzn $ fb $ aapl $ nflx $ tsla"". So, it mentions the stock price of QQQ and some others like MSFT, GPRO, GOOG, etc., which are all tech stocks. It also says ""triggered buy"" on a platform called Sigma-X or something similar. This sounds like a news event that might cause a buy signal for investors.

The second tweet is ""URL <-- exciting new AT_USER guru ! this guy is gonna be huge ! $ vltc $ vggl $ amzn $ msft"". The user mentions an AT_USER (which I think stands for Alphabet User, which could refer to Meta or another company) and talks about potential stock price movements. They use the word ""guru,"" suggesting someone thinks something great is about to happen, possibly positive news.

Third tweet: Same as the first one but in a different time zone? Or maybe it's just a typo on the URL. It mentions QQQ again along with other tech stocks.

Fourth tweet: ""rt AT_USER $ gpro inventories could be a lot worse at our local $ bby / $ goog $ fb $ aapl $ amzn AT_USER ..."". This seems to suggest that the company is performing poorly in their inventories, which might lead investors to sell and reduce their position. The mention of BBY makes me think about a negative trend.

Fifth tweet: ""the chart porn is ready to go to make up from yesterday . $ aapl $ amzn $ tsla $ googl $ nflx $ fb - … URL"". This one seems like it's talking about the stock charts being about to change, possibly in a positive or negative way. It could indicate that investors are waiting for some event.

Sixth tweet: ""inside salesforce : the best cloud computing company ? $ crm also $ aapl $ amzn $ orcl $ googl URL"". Here, the user is questioning the quality of cloud computing services, suggesting potential investments in companies like CRM. Cloud computing being a good sector could be positive, but it depends on whether the company itself is doing well.

Seventh tweet: ""fdx fedex corp . financials URL $ fdx $ amzn $ gxc $ rwm fdx pennystocks invest"". The word ""fedex"" might refer to something like Fed Ex or a financial company. It mentions AMZN and others, suggesting the stock is performing in a sector that could be positive for investors.

Eighth tweet: ""AT_USER i like $ qcom and $ fb . i know this doesn't matter but $ amzn has too ridiculous of a p / e for me"". The user seems to have some investment goals here. They like QCOM and FB, which are tech stocks, and think AMZN is having bad P/E ratio. A higher P/E could indicate overvaluation or bad company performance.

Ninth tweet: ""xom exxon mobil corp . ideas URL $ xom $ amzn $ gbsn $ efa xom share pennystocks"". Similar to the seventh tweet, mentions XOM and AMZN as financials. XOM is a big tech stock, so this could be positive or negative depending on the market.

Now, summarizing each tweet:

1. Buy signals
2. Hype about new AT_USER
3. More QQQ and tech stocks
4. Inventory performance down
5. Chart change in tech sector
6. Cloud computing company being good
7. Financials including FDX
8. Positive P/E ratio on AMZN
9. More XOM

Positive factors: The buy signals (1, 3), inventory down (4), cloud computing (6), financials (7 and 9). Negative factors: Exciting new AT_USER, chart change (5), positive P/E on AMZN.

Putting it all together: There are both positive signals like buying stocks that might go up, but there's also some concern about the company's inventory performance and potential positive news from AT_USER. Some tweets hint at a tech sector change and strong financials. The overall sentiment seems mixed but leaning towards positive since many factors support growth, especially with companies like AMZN and XOM being in sectors that might benefit from market trends.

So I think it leans more towards Positive."
2015-12-12,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. Looking through the tweets, it seems like Amazon is the main player, so I'll focus on that. The symbol might be something like AMZN or others, but assuming the relevant stock is Amazon for now.

Next, I'll go through each tweet one by one and separate them into positive and negative factors. For example, in the first tweet, it mentions a 336% increase over two weeks, which sounds positive. So that's a strong positive factor.

The second tweet talks about a trendkanal going down after being bought, which might indicate support or something else, but I'm not sure if that's positive or negative. It could be speculative.

Third tweet mentions gains in alerts and getting early access to new picks, which is usually good for investors. That sounds positive.

Fourth tweet lists multiple stocks mentioned elsewhere, so it's a general positive note from the user about diversification.

Fifth tweet talks about technical analysis and stock trades, but I'm not sure how that directly affects Amazon's future price unless it indicates support or expectations of continued gains.

Sixth tweet mentions an AT_USER making an old tech analysis video on AMZN. This is probably speculative and doesn't give a clear indication of the stock's performance yet.

Seventh tweet gives personal experiences about buying several tech stocks, which again might not directly impact Amazon's future price unless it's a recommendation or just personal speculation.

So summarizing, the main positive factors are the 336% increase, gains from alerts and diversification. The negative factors seem minimal here because the other tweets don't clearly indicate any negative sentiment towards Amazon. Therefore, the overall sentiment is probably [Neutral], as there's a mix of support without significant contradictory information."
2015-12-13,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided two tweets and wants an analysis on their impact on a company's stock price. They mentioned using specific tags: [Positive], [Neutral], or [Negative]. 

First, I need to understand what each tweet is saying. The first tweet mentions ""cdii china direct industries inc . p / e ratio URL $ cdii $ amzn $ bac $ goog cdii tradeideas nasdaq."" It seems like it's providing information about a company named cdii and its financial metrics, which might affect investor views on that stock.

The second tweet is more specific: ""v visa inc . current price URL $ v $ ewj $ am zn v nasdaq stock."" Here, it looks like the user is looking at visa inc., specifically mentioning their current price, which could influence investor sentiment regarding another company.

I'm not entirely sure how these tweets relate to a single stock, so I need to consider if they are discussing the same company. The words ""cdii"" and ""v visa"" don't ring a bell as significant terms in a broader market context. It's possible these tweets might be providing information about sectors or industry trends rather than specific companies.

Since both tweets seem to provide financial data that could influence investor expectations, I think they are part of a broader analysis of market sentiment rather than directly affecting a single stock. This makes it tricky because the impact on a particular stock isn't clear from just these tweets without more context about which stock is being discussed.

Given this uncertainty, it's hard to assign positive, neutral, or negative sentiment solely based on these tweets. They might be indicating that investors are concerned with certain companies but not specifying how they affect a specific stock.

So, my conclusion would have to be Neutral because without knowing exactly what each tweet refers to and if they're about the same stock, it's impossible to determine their impact. It's more of an indicator for broader market analysis or sector trends."
2015-12-14,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, I have to analyze the impact of these tweets on the stock price of amzn and decide if it's positive, neutral, or negative.

First, I need to identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking through them, I see some mentions of ""amzn"" in the URLs like ""URL $ amzn up +0.85 % percent today $ am zn stock high is at 649.97..."" and ""Rs $ amzn buy rating reiterated at oppenheimer URL"". So, the target symbol seems to be amzn.

Next, I go through each tweet one by one. 

1. The first tweet says ""rt $ tsla hft algos triggered sell in sigma-x , crossfinder , ats , lx @ 09:37 , p / t 205.00 quant $ msft $ gpro $ goog $ amzn $ fb $ aapl $ nflx $ qqq"". I can see mentions of ""sigma-x"", ""crossfinder"", and ""ats"" which might be investors, but it's not clear if they are positive or negative factors. The user is selling in several stocks: sigma-x, crossfinder, ats, lx. That could indicate negative sentiment because selling might suggest concerns about their performance.

2. The second tweet mentions that URL inc. $ amzn earns an ""overweight rating from analysts"" and the current price is 649.97, which is up, but it doesn't give much context. It's more of a statement about the company's financials without any specific positive or negative factors mentioned.

3. The third tweet talks about amzn stock going up by +0.85%, high at 649.97, low at 639.62, volume around 1,060, and shares trading over 6,366. This is a positive news since the stock is moving up. High, low, and volume all are indicators of rising activity.

4. The fourth tweet says $ amzn's buy rating is ""retriated"" from Oppenheimer. Buy ratings generally indicate investor sentiment towards buying more shares, which can be seen as positive but sometimes can lead to overbidding or other market behaviors.

5. This tweet doesn't specify any factors related to amzn. It seems like just a general comment about the stock without any specific positive or negative indicators.

6. The fifth tweet mentions ""big big lots , inc . news"" with $ big, $ amzn, etc., in the price list. This could be indicating that big lots is a competitor or a related company whose performance might impact amzn. It's not clear if this is positive or negative yet.

7. The sixth tweet talks about amzn being ""all weather"" stocks for the S&P 500, mentioning several companies like amzn, fb, googl, etc. This phrase suggests that amzn is in a good position because it doesn't have bad news. It could mean positive sentiment as investors are expecting stability.

8. The seventh tweet mentions the WSJ and an article about ""all weather"" stocks for S&P 500: amzn, fb, googl, etc. Similar to point 7, this suggests that these companies are undervalued or expected to perform well, which is positive sentiment.

9. Another tweet just says $ amzn (no specific factors).

10. The last tweet mentions a 3,500% gain in 5 months and an exclusive first look about amzn, mcox, goog. Positive growth and new products could be seen as positive news for amzn's future.

Now, putting it all together. The user is selling in several stocks (sigma-x, crossfinder, ats, lx), which might indicate concern but not necessarily negative sentiment on the stock itself. There are mentions of a significant increase in stock price (3,500% gain) and specific articles about amzn being ""all weather"" stocks. The volume is high, and the buy rating suggests investor interest could be strong.

However, the tweet with ""big big lots , inc . news"" might indicate that there's competition or a related company whose performance is expected to be good. That doesn't necessarily mean amzn will suffer, but it's something to consider.

Looking at the factors: positive factors include high stock price, buy ratings, and volume. Negative factors are limited by some mentions of selling stocks but not clear concerns.

In terms of sentiment analysis, each tweet can be seen as providing mixed information. However, given that amzn is mentioned in multiple tweets with positive factors (high stock prices, buy ratings) and less negative ones, the overall sentiment seems to lean towards positive because there are significant upward movements and mentions of all-weather stocks which imply stability or good prospects.

Therefore, despite some unclear information about selling stocks, the emphasis on positive price movement and other positive indicators suggests a positive impact on amzn's stock."
2015-12-15,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me start by reading each tweet carefully.

The first tweet is ""$ amzn $ wfm $ chk options have the largest change in price . free options screener . URL"". Hmm, ""wfm"" seems like a typo because ""WFM"" usually stands for Weekday Morning News or an acronym from a specific industry. Since it's unclear, I should probably skip this one as it might not provide any meaningful information. The mention of the largest change in price is interesting; maybe it's suggesting that the options are moving a lot, but without context on how this affects Amazon's stock, it's hard to tell.

The second tweet is ""$ amzn what happened to apple's cable ambitions ? URL"". This one seems to be questioning Apple's cable ambitions. That could be interpreted as either positive or negative. If it's about whether Apple's focus on cable services has negatively impacted Amazon, maybe in terms of market share or customer acquisition, that might influence Amazon's stock. But I'm not entirely sure how significant this impact is or if it directly affects the stock price.

Now, considering the first tweet doesn't give clear information, I think I should ignore it for now and focus on the second tweet. The sentiment here seems uncertain because it's a bit vague. Maybe some investors are concerned about Apple's cable ambitions affecting Amazon, but without specific data or analysis, it's hard to assess the actual impact.

Since I'm stuck between ignoring the first tweet and analyzing the second, which is still ambiguous, perhaps the best approach is to consider that the overall sentiment remains Neutral. This way, even if one tweet could suggest a negative angle, the other is too vague to make a confident decision."
2015-12-16,Missing,File not found
2015-12-17,Neutral,"Alright, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. First, I'll extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. The words ""amzn"" appear in all of them, so that's the stock we're focusing on.

Next, for each tweet, I have to identify positive and negative factors. Let me go through each one step by step.

The first tweet says, ""can anyone challenge amazon's e-commerce dominance in the u . s . ?"" This seems like a question, not a tweet with information. Maybe it's a prompt or a statement by Amazon, but I don't see how that translates to positive or negative factors for their stock. It might be about future challenges.

The second tweet is ""twitter chat: can anyone challenge amazon's e-commerce dominance in the u . s . ?"" Again, similar structure—perhaps someone engaging on Twitter, maybe a competitor, challenging Amazon. This could mean they're looking at potential threats or developments but don't specify any positive or negative implications for Amazon.

The third tweet is ""can anyone else challenge? @ebay and others are going to have issues with their supply chains."" Here, the user mentions other companies like eBay having supply chain issues. Supply chain problems can affect a company's operations, costs, and potentially profitability. This could lead to decreased demand or higher competition, which might be seen as a negative factor.

Now, putting it all together: The first tweet suggests a potential future challenge but doesn't give specific information. The second tweet talks about competitors facing issues but again isn't concrete. The third tweet clearly points out supply chain problems for other companies, indicating a potential disruption in Amazon's supply chain, which could impact their operations and stock price.

Since the tweets are more about current or upcoming challenges rather than positive news or updates, they don't provide clear information that would significantly impact Amazon's stock. They focus on factors that might be negative, like supply chain issues affecting other companies but not directly improving Amazon's situation.

Therefore, without specific positive or negative indicators from these tweets, I can't conclude a strong overall sentiment towards the stock. The impact is more about potential future challenges than any clear influence on the stock price."
2015-12-18,Missing,File not found
2015-12-19,Missing,File not found
2015-12-20,Positive,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether these tweets are positive, neutral, or negative in terms of their impact on Amazon's stock price. Let me break down each tweet step by step.

First, looking at the target stock symbol, it seems like Amazon is involved since some tweets mention things like ""invest"" and ""amzn"". So I'll focus on those. 

Now, for each tweet, I need to separate positive and negative factors. The first tweet just says a URL with ""inc."" for amZN, but it's pretty vague. It mentions the URL being inc., which is not very specific about sentiment. Maybe that could be neutral or slightly negative since URLs can sometimes carry hidden meanings.

The second tweet talks about wanting to put intentions on paper, meaning they're trying to get someone to write down their goals and actions. That sounds like it's emphasizing control over their investment strategy. I'm leaning towards positive here because having clear objectives might boost confidence in the stock.

The third tweet mentions ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) with specific percentages: Netflix at 141%, Amazon at 114%, ATVI at 90%. High returns on high-dividend-yield stocks can attract investors and drive demand. This could be seen as positive by boosting Amazon's stock price.

Putting it all together, each tweet seems to contribute different aspects of positivity towards the stock. The second tweet is a bit ambiguous but hints at clarity and control, while the third one suggests potential growth through returns. Together, these elements point towards a generally positive outlook for Amazon's stock."
2015-12-21,Negative,"Alright, I need to analyze these tweets and determine their impact on Amazon's future stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll extract the target stock symbol from each tweet. The most straightforward one is ""amzn"". So all other mentions of amzn will be related to Amazon.

1. **Worker Walkoff:** This seems like a negative event because workers leaving could lead to lower employee morale and increased costs for companies, especially if they're employees. I'll note this as Negative.

2. **Trading Alerts:** The mention of trading alerts is positive because it shows the stock is being watched and can indicate investor interest. So Positive.

3. ** spacex推迟发射:** This mentions SpaceX delaying its rocket launch, which could increase competition from other companies like Tesla andMeta. That's a negative sign for Amazon due to potential competition. Negative.

4. ** Fed Rejection of Queries:** The Fed rejecting queries about $ odp (which I think is $ ford) could indicate investor concerns about the company's financials or future prospects. This might lead to uncertainty, which could be Negative.

5. **Downside Room:** The tweet talks about more room in the stock price going down, suggesting hope for growth. Positive.

6. **Stock Market Updates:** The link to a website with various stocks is positive because it indicates broader interest and not a specific negative event. Neutral.

7. **Healthcare Sector Shares:** This suggests Amazon's shares are being sold in a sector focused on healthcare. If the company operates in an undervalued industry, this could be Positive if seen as growth. Maybe Neutral or Positive depending on context.

8. **Cargo Plan Acquisition:** The acquisition of cargo planes is a strategic move to reduce reliance on parcel services. This can create competition from other companies like FedEx and Amazon. Negative impact.

9. ** hoverboard scare:** The mention of a hoverboard scare leading to losses might be negative if it's a real risk, impacting the stock price. Negative.

10. **Maxlist Stocks:** Mentioning several stocks is positive because it increases investor interest in Amazon. Positive.

11. **Visa Short Sales:** Trading short with Visa indicates interest in Amazon, which can boost sentiment. Positive.

Now, let's count the factors:

- Negative: 3 tweets (1,3,8)
- Positive: 6 tweets (2,5,7,10,11)
- Neutral: 1 tweet (4)

Since there are more negative than positive tweets, it suggests a general downward trend in sentiment. However, some positive tweets like trading alerts and interest stocks might counterbalance the negatives.

Overall, with moderate negative factors outweighing positive ones, I think the sentiment leans towards Negative."
2015-12-22,Negative,"Okay, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

Looking at the first few tweets from 1 to 32, they all seem to mention that Amazon is doing well. They talk about their financials, changes in settings, and potential issues if something doesn't work. These could be a concern or a risk for investors but don't necessarily show strong positive or negative sentiment right now.

From tweet 33 onwards (tweets 33-45), I see that the market is rallying with specific sectors mentioned like dji, aple, spy, dis, googl, etc. This indicates good news for Amazon and its competitors, which could lead to higher stock prices.

But wait, tweets 1-15 are about the company's performance but not specifically regarding Amazon's stock price itself. These might be broader market reactions that don't directly impact Amazon unless there's a correlation or indication of support from Amazon's fans.

Tweets 26 and 32 also mention the market is rallies in specific sectors, which could affect Amazon's performance across various products or services but isn't a direct tweet about Amazon's stock price. However, if these sector rallies do lead to positive news for the overall economy or specific industries, it might indirectly support Amazon.

Considering all this, while there are mentions of good market trends and company performance, the tweets don't provide direct information that would significantly influence Amazon's stock price. They might indicate general economic trends but not enough data to confidently conclude a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment."
2015-12-23,Negative,"Alright, let's figure out how to assess the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price based on the given instructions.

First, I need to identify the target stock from each tweet. It seems like most of them are about Amazon (AMZN) or other tech companies. So the main focus is AMZN.

Looking at each tweet one by one:

1. The first tweet talks about an investor debate and mentions $amzn. It doesn't specify a sentiment, so maybe it's neutral.
2. Another tweet lists free stock picks, again just mentioning AMZN but not explicitly stating sentiment.
3. This tweet discusses the relationship between Amazon and UPS, noting that their client circle is fraying. That could be seen as negative because the industry competition might affect Amazon's growth.
4. The tweet mentions AMZN seeking to ease ties with UPS, which might signal a strategic move towards diversification or cost reduction, potentially positive for investor sentiment.
5. The tweet questions whether AMZN will deliver tomorrow if they order now, which is more of a statement about expectations rather than direct impact on stock price.
6. This tweet lists early movers and their stocks, indicating competition but not necessarily sentiment.
7. Another list of companies, suggesting volume growth among tech giants.
8. The tweet mentions AMZN's valuation being under $650, which could be seen as a sell-off if valuations are low.
9. This tweet talks about AMZN's weak performance and others' leading positions, pointing towards potential issues affecting Amazon.
10. This is about Disks (DIS), not related to AMZN.
11. Discusses AMZN's weakness alongside leading companies, suggesting a broader market environment issue.
12. Again lists AMZN requests for passwords, which doesn't impact the stock price directly.
13. Financials info from a week ago on AMZN.

Now, combining all these factors: some tweets are more about industry competition or investor sentiment, while others talk about valuations or performance. There's definitely a mention of AMZN being underperforming in terms of valuation (line 8), which could be negative. However, the other tweets discuss trends like diversification and market competition, which can be seen as positive signs but are not definitive.

Overall, there seems to be a mix of positive factors like diversification and potential issues about valuations, which might balance out negative impacts. The strongest indicator is line 8's valuation suggesting lower growth, so it leans slightly negative, though the rest suggests potential upturns. It's a mix but leaning towards negative."
2015-12-24,Neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out how the given tweets impact the stock price of Amazon. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I identify the target stock symbol from the tweets. Looking through the tweets, I see a few mentions like ""gigantic millisecond stock"" and others that don't clearly state a stock name. Since none are present, maybe it's ambiguous, so I might consider that there's no clear target stock. But since at least one tweet mentions ""amzn"", which is a common abbreviation for Amazon, I'll go with ""Amazon"".

Next, I analyze each tweet to find positive and negative factors. The first few tweets talk about Benzinga interviews, which I'm not familiar with, but some mention that Amazon is the undisputed top brand in the online sales market share. This suggests that people are supportive of Amazon's position in their financial discussions.

Looking at each relevant tweet: 

1. ""gis general mills incorporate message board posts URL $ gis $ amzn $ nugt $ xbi gis pennystocks stockmarket"" – I'm not sure what this is about, but it might be a typo or additional information without a specific stock mentioned.
2. ""rt AT_USER this morning's interview on benzinga ( i'm on the last half hour ): $ ung $ cmg $ sune $ amzn - - URL http …"" – Not clear, but mentions Benzinga and Amazon in context.
3. ""am zn url"" – Again, unclear without a specific stock name.
4. ""rt AT_USER this morning's interview on benzinga ( i'm on the last half hour ): $ung cmg sune amzn - - url http …"" – Same as above, mentions Benzinga but not clearly a stock.
5. ""tickers trending on twtr in last 1 hour $ aapl am zn $ fb googl twtr url … URL"" – This talks about Apple, Amazon, etc., suggesting Amazon's position in tech.
6. ""rt AT_USER ups and fedex going to 3 in logistics , behind $ amzn ?"" – Talks about stock performance but not clearly supporting or opposing Amazon.
7. Same as tweet 4: this morning's interview on benzinga …
8. Same as tweet 5: same analysis.

All the tweets are discussing Amazon's position, their market share, and related companies in tech and general trading contexts. There's no direct indication of positive, negative, or neutral sentiment towards Amazon. The mentions of other brands like Benzinga and iOS/Android might suggest broader investor sentiment, but without specific stock performance data, it's hard to determine the overall impact on Amazon's stock price.

Therefore, since there's no clear information indicating support, concern, or lack thereof for Amazon, I should conclude that the stock is [Neutral]."
2015-12-25,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to analyze these tweets for their impact on Amazon's stock price. The user has given four tweets and I need to determine if each is positive, neutral, or negative. Then, based on that, decide the overall sentiment.

First, looking at tweet 1: ""amzn URL inc . message board posts URL $ amzn $ biib $ pcln $ nwsa am zn pennystocks pennystocks."" Hmm, this seems like a link to a stock quote or analysis from pennystocks.com. It doesn't specify any positive or negative information about Amazon's performance yet.

Moving on to tweet 2: ""% change URL $ amzn $ regn $ slw $ cie am zn amZN pennystocks."" Again, it looks like another stock quote from pennystocks, mentioning a percentage change but without indicating whether it's up or down. So, this is just speculative info.

Tweet 3: ""analysts expect 2188 % earnings growth in 3 years from $ amzn URL URL."" This tweet seems to predict future earnings. It specifically mentions ""expect"" which can indicate positive expectations. The number is quite high, but again, it's speculative and doesn't mention if they think Amazon will go up or down.

Finally, tweet 4: ""more evidence that amazon is testing european logistics network - air cargo world ( registration ) URL amazon • $ amzn."" This one seems to talk about Amazon's plans regarding European logistics. It mentions a test involving their European operations and air cargo, which is a strategic move they might be considering.

Now, breaking it down step by step:

1. Identify the target stock: The first part of each tweet looks like ""amzn URL inc."" So, the target stock seems to be Amazon, specifically amzn.

2. Tweet-by-tweet analysis:
- Tweet 1 and 2 are links to stock quotes, so they don't contribute much except for context.
- Tweets 3 and 4 provide speculative information about Amazon's future actions or outlooks.

3. Assess sentiment:
- Tweets 3 and 4 predict future earnings or strategic moves, which can indicate optimism (Positive).
- Tweet 4 mentions a logistics network test, which could be seen as a positive sign for growth and stability.
- Tweets 1 and 2 are just stock quotes without explicit sentiment indicators.

4. Overall sentiment summary:
Even though tweets 3 and 4 have some speculative information, they do include positive language (like ""expect"" and ""testing""). Additionally, mentioning future actions like logistics could suggest a potential shift in company strategy that might be favorable for investors, especially if it leads to growth or expansion.

So, despite the uncertainty in tweets 1 and 2, there are some positive elements that could influence investor sentiment. Therefore, the overall sentiment is likely Positive."
2015-12-26,Neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. So, the user has provided some tweets and wants me to analyze their impact on a stock's future price by determining if it's positive, neutral, or negative. They also gave specific steps and output requirements.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. Looking at tweet 1: ""rt AT_USER yep . apple's iphone business is this big . incredible stat and chart : URL $ aapl $ googl $ fb $ amzn"". The user mentions Apple Inc., so that must be the target stock, which is Apple (AAPL). 

Next, I have to perform a tweet-by-tweet analysis. Each tweet can have positive or negative factors. In this case, the tweet has multiple mentions of Apple's iPhone business being significant and includes data URLs for different companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These seem unrelated in terms of their financial performance, but perhaps they are related to tech trends or broader market sentiment.

Now, I'll separate positive and negative factors. The tweet itself doesn't explicitly mention any positive or negative aspects about the stock, so maybe both are neutral here? Alternatively, it could be interpreted as a mix since all companies listed might be part of the same tech sector but with different implications on Apple's performance.

Assessing sentiment: The user is providing information about the iPhone business, which can affect multiple industries. For example, if the tech sector is strong, the stock might go up; if there are negative news about Apple, it could impact the overall market. But since this tweet is more about trends than specific financials related to Apple's stock, sentiment might be neutral.

Finally, combining all analyses, since the tweet doesn't provide positive or negative information directly about Apple's stock and instead mentions other tech companies, I think the sentiment here would be neutral."
2015-12-27,Negative,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether the given tweets are positive, neutral, or negative impact on the stock price for the company in question. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the target stock from the tweets. The symbols provided don't seem standard, but looking at them like ""nok"" and ""xlf,"" I'm not sure which one is being referred to. Maybe it's a typo or something else? Alternatively, perhaps ""xlk"" refers to X-linked stocks or another stock symbol entirely.

Next, the tweets are: nok nokia corp . volume URL $ nok $ amzn $ xlk $ millq nok pennystocks finance. It looks like these are multiple tweets mentioning different stocks and symbols. I'll need to parse each tweet individually.

Let's look at the first tweet: ""nok nokia corp . volume URL $ nok $ amzn $ xlk $ millq nok pennystocks finance."" The words here include ""nok,"" which might be a symbol or a typo for ""nokia."" ""volume"" probably refers to trading volume. ""$"" is often used to denote prices, so maybe this tweet mentions multiple stocks: nok, nokia, amzn, xlk, millq, pennystocks, and finance.

Wait, that's quite a list of stocks. Maybe the user is referring to different sectors or something else entirely. ""Nok"" could be an acronym for something, like ""NoFile"" which stands for Nothing Files. But that doesn't seem standard in stock analysis. Alternatively, it might be a typo or irrelevant information.

The next tweet: ""nok $ amzn $ xlk $ millq nok pennystocks finance."" It looks similar to the first one but again with the same issues of unclear symbols and possibly some repetition. I'm not sure how ""millq"" fits into this; that doesn't seem familiar as a stock symbol.

Looking at all these tweets, they're all about different stocks with terms like ""volume,"" ""$"" for price, and various other abbreviations. None of them are clear on what the actual company is or their relationship to each other. This makes it challenging to assess any impact because the information provided is inconsistent and unclear.

Without a clear target stock symbol from the tweets, I can't determine the sentiment. Each tweet is talking about multiple stocks without specifying which one is the focus. So, I don't have enough context to evaluate whether these tweets positively or negatively affect any specific company's stock price.

Therefore, with the information given, it's impossible to conclude the overall impact on a single stock. The data provided is too vague and inconsistent."
2015-12-28,Neutral,"Alright, I need to determine the impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

1. **First Tweet**: It mentions ""best"" and includes the word ""mouse,"" suggesting a positive sentiment about Amazon, especially since "" dad's money"" is in the context of a link. This seems like a mix of positive and slightly negative elements. I'll consider it neutral.

2. **Second Tweet**: Talks about Netflix, Amazon, and others in 2015. While tech stocks do dip during the tech rush, 2015 was the start of that period, so this tweet might indicate that the market is cooling down but not a clear sell-off yet.

3. **Third Tweet**: Adds calls to $ nflx and $ googl, which are Amazon's stock symbols. This could be signaling an upward move as investors expect gains from these stocks. Positive sentiment seems likely here.

4. **Fourth Tweet**: Talks about FANG's returns but doesn't provide much detail on how it affects Amazon. It mentions percentages and an average, suggesting a positive outlook for tech companies in general. Still leaning positive.

5. **Fifth Tweet**: Highlights the increase in prime subscribers for Amazon, which is good news since that's a strong growth area. This direct mention of subscriber numbers should be seen as a positive sign.

6. **Sixth Tweet**: Discusses trending assets and indexes, like DJIA, SBER, etc. While tech stocks are part of broader market trends, the context here doesn't directly impact Amazon's stock performance much.

7. **Seventh Tweet**: Talks about NASDAQ 100 stocks and specific companies, but it's unclear how this relates to Amazon. The mention of other sectors might not have a direct effect on Amazon.

8. **Eighth Tweet**: Lists the most trafficked tech apps in 2015 and mentions trading all their stock, indicating a potential for good performance from these apps, which could include Amazon. Positive sentiment here is supported by the expected gains.

9. **Ninth Tweet**: Discusses NASDAQ 100 performance but doesn't specify how it affects Amazon. It might indicate that the market overall is performing well, which could be positive or not, but given the context, it's mixed.

10. **Tenth Tweet**: Ends with closing $ tqqq day and some stock positions. This seems more like a trading update than affecting Amazon directly. Neutral sentiment here as it's about trading rather than performance.

11. **Eleventh Tweet**: References the Wall Street breakfast question and mentions Disney shares, which could be speculative but might suggest a positive outlook if people think about entertainment, which overlaps with tech sectors sometimes discussed in this context.

12. **Twelfth Tweet**: Discusses Amazon's holiday tradition of saying nothing while sharing business details. This is neutral as it doesn't directly impact Amazon's stock performance.

13. **Thirteenth Tweet**: Looks at Amazon's inc., eod data, and mentions some tech companies. Positive sentiment based on the implied growth in these areas.

14. **Fourteenth Tweet**: Directly mentions G reordered for 2016 and how it affects Amazon. While it doesn't provide specifics, expecting a gain could push Amazon higher.

15. **Fifteenth Tweet**: Refers to bigdata and IOT, which are sectors that have increased in popularity since 2016. This could lead to mixed results for Amazon as these areas might be affected by the company's product availability or performance.

Now, combining all these thoughts: there are several positive tweets about subscriber growth, expected performance from tech companies, GROVE trends, and IOT developments. However, some tweets like the Wall Street breakfast question and NASDAQ data have mixed signals. The overall sentiment seems to lean towards a mix of positive and neutral factors. There's no clear long-term trend indicating a strong up or down movement."
2015-12-29,Positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this analysis. So, I need to determine if each tweet is positive, neutral, or negative in terms of its impact on a given company's stock price. The stock symbol mentioned isn't provided, but from the tweets, it seems like we're focusing on AMZN because several tweets mention it.

Looking at each tweet one by one:

1. The first tweet mentions AT_USER stocks hitting all-time highs with various tech symbols. That sounds positive.
2. The second tweet talks about AMZN's jumping on a prepper trend. Positive.
3. Third tweet from AT_USER is commented on stocktwits, but the content is unclear; it mentions not wanting a window to be undressed. That might be neutral or negative depending on context.
4. Fourth tweet says AMZN expanded into the grocery service in the UK. That's positive for growth.
5. The fifth tweet from Goldman Sachs upgraded $BZUN with a target of 20, which is good news for investors looking to buy.
6. Sixth tweet talks about FANG returns. I know FANG has been strong but it depends on how they perform this year; maybe neutral or positive if their performance is up.
7. Seventh tweet is a friendly message from AMZN to everyone, which seems positive.
8. Eighth tweet says AMZN is breaking out ahead of schedule. That's a good sign, so positive.
9. Ninth tweet mentions AMZN's 5 points of communication with Warner Inc., which could be positive about their performance.
10. Tenth tweet talks about new records for closing highs on multiple stocks including AMZN. Positive for the company.
11. eleventh tweet from AT_USER about management wanting details, which is good news for investors.
12. Twelfth tweet upsets some sentiment with an enthusiastic CEO comment regarding large retailers being worse off without AMZN. That's a strong statement, positive.
13. Thirteenth tweet mentions Earnings Per Share (EPS) ratio, but the content is unclear and seems negative because it's about p/E and maybe not great for investors.
14. Fourteenth tweet claims that the house of cards in NFLX isn't good news. That's a strong statement, positive.
15. Fifteenth tweet talks about millionaires choosing uranium-pinto-beans with FANG stock jumps. That sounds negative because it's speculative and could hurt AMZN's stock.
16. Sixteenth tweet says AMZN is reading a textbook intraday flag break. If this means something significant, maybe negative if it's bad news.
17. Seventeenth tweet mentions the most trafficked tech apps in 2015, including FB, Google, and Amazon. That sounds positive because more users are engaged with tech companies.

Now, compiling all these thoughts:

- Positive tweets: 1,2,4,7,8,9,10,11,12,14,16 (but some of these may vary in impact)
- Neutral tweets: Maybe none here since the positive ones are numerous
- Negative tweets: 3,5,13,15

So overall, the majority seem to be positive. The negative ones include a few, but they don't outweigh the positives."
2015-12-30,Positive,"Okay, I need to figure out the overall impact of these tweets on Amazon's stock price. Let me go through each tweet step by step.

First, I'll look for any mentions of the company or specific terms related to it. The first tweet talks about a platform moving fast, but nothing definitive happens that affects Amazon. Then, in tweet 2 and 3, they mention IBM and AMZN. I know IBM is an investment firm, not a stock, so maybe that's a distraction.

Tweet 4 mentions earnings ahead of 2016 but doesn't provide any specific information about the stock price. Tweets 5 and 6 talk about Amazon's expectations and some indices like SPY (SPDR S&P 500) and others. These could be positive because they're showing interest in their performance.

Tweets 7-9 discuss specific company names, which are all unrelated to Amazon. Tweet 10 mentions that multiple companies are rising due to earnings, suggesting optimism about the market but not a direct impact on Amazon's stock price. Tweets 11 and 12 talk about hitting highs; while these could indicate investor confidence, they don't mention how that affects Amazon.

Tweets 13-15 discuss other sectors like aerospace or tech companies. Tweet 16 talks about a purchase order for the Chinese commercial aerospace sector but again, not related to Amazon. Tweets 17 and 18 are about Wall Street breakfast, which is a non-event.Tweet 19 suggests that Amazon sold a time machine, which is an absurd statement unrelated to stock price changes.

Looking at tweet 6, it mentions a very strong trend with some indices reaching specific ADX values. High ADX can indicate overbought or overvalued stocks, so this might suggest that Amazon's stock could be too expensive relative to the market. However, other tweets mention earnings and general market optimism without concrete data.

Considering all these points, I think the main indicators are the high ADX in tweet 6, which is a strong sign of strength, but combined with the fact that Amazon has beaten expectations from previous tweets (tweets 5-19), it's possible they're seeing an increase. However, none of the direct statements indicate any negative news about their stock price. So overall sentiment might be slightly positive."
2015-12-31,Negative,"Alright, let's try to figure out how to determine the impact on the stock price based on these tweets. So, first, I need to go through each tweet one by one and see what they're saying about a specific company. The user mentioned that the target stock is determined from the tweets, so I need to extract it.

Looking at the first tweet: ""$ tpac 50s here we come ! ! $ aapl $ fb $ eurusd $ spy $ tsla $ amzn $ gbpusd $ chk $ wtw $ nflx $ usd happynewyear newyear URL"" Hmm, that's a bit confusing. It mentions several stocks and URLs. The word ""tpac"" might be a typo or misspelling. Maybe it's ""TPAC"" instead? I'll assume that the target stock is ""TPAC"" since that's mentioned.

Now, looking at each tweet, they're all talking about AMZN, which stands for Amazon. Each tweet has several words mentioning AMZN. So, if I can figure out what the tweet says about AMZN, I can assess its impact on the stock price.

Let me go through them one by one:

1. The first tweet starts with ""tpac 50s here we come ! ! $ aapl $ fb $ eurusd $ spy $ tsla $ amzn $ ..."". It's discussing various stocks and URLs, but doesn't specify anything about AMZN.
2. The second tweet mentions AMZN as well: ""$ kre spdr kbw regional banking index etf bid size URL $ kre $ fsagx $ amzn $.""
3. Third tweet talks about NASDAQ up 10%, mentioning several winners including AMZN and others.
4. Fourth tweet says that AMZN is ""strong bounce off of support."" That sounds positive, suggesting it's going well.
5. Fifth tweet mentions Amazon in a bearish context: ""bluestar making his bear case via $ amzn in , 'the ghost of xmas yet to come !' Bearish URL.""
6. Sixth tweet questions AMZN for 2016, but again, just stating it's about AMZN.
7. Seventh tweet mentions Amazon as the fastest-growing tech company, which is a good sign.
8. Eighth tweet talks about various stocks like AGL and VZ, including AMZN.
9. Ninth tweet says BMO studied prices are 26% lower than Amazon, which is interesting but not clear on what it means for AMZN's stock.
10. Tenth tweet asks about the top three S&P 500 stocks, mentioning AMZN and others.
11. Eleventh tweet offers a free trading membership to sign up, mentioning several companies including AMZN.
12. Twelfth tweet talks about option millionaires thinking AMZN would sell big URLs.
13. Thirteenth tweet mentions assets rising in the FTSE 100 with AMZN and others increasing.
14. Similar to tweet 7, stating that the NASDAQ up, mentioning AMZN as one of the biggest winners.
15. Twelfth tweet discusses TPAC CEO pulling through on their promises, mentioning multiple companies including Amazon.
16. Twelfth tweet is about closing above a certain level on the S&P, suggesting potential for higher prices.

So, most tweets are positive or discussing trends related to AMZN and other tech stocks. The ones that mention AMZN specifically are mostly positive: ""strong bounce off of support,"" ""up 10%,"" "" Bearish,"" and ""top three best performing stocks."" These all seem like they indicate good news for Amazon's stock price.

However, there's one tweet (tweet 9) that says BMO studied prices being lower than Amazon. While this might suggest a trend or expected future performance, it doesn't explicitly state anything positive about AMZN's current position relative to its competitors or broader market trends. It could mean that Amazon is performing better or underperforming compared to other tech companies, which can sometimes influence investor sentiment but isn't conclusive by itself.

Looking at the overall sentiment from all these tweets: most are positive, some mention recent performance (like up 10%) and negative mentions about specific events (like bearish on AMZN in tweet 5). There's a mix of both supportive and contradictory information.

But since the majority of the tweets don't directly address AMZN's current stock price but rather trends and market expectations around other tech stocks, it's hard to conclusively determine if it's positive or negative for Amazon. The mixed reviews from some tweets make it seem like there might be uncertainty about Amazon's position relative to others.

So, without a clear indication of how these trends affect AMZN's current price compared to others or its broader market position, the impact is somewhat uncertain but positive overall given the supportive information."
